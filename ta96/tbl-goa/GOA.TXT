     timing made on 030/28Mhz so don't complain if you got less power

         and yes we prefer 2x2 with enough colors before 256 cols

                 we guess the music fucks up on a4000/040

                        this production is freeware

          We guess our demo-OS tries to fool you about the length

                         one week demos are enough

       written agreement from TBL before earning money on this thing
