[ Overview ]

Planet R is an invitation intro to Revision 2022.

The intro is a tribute to the game Menace, developed by DMA Design and published by Psygnosis in 1988.
It is designed like in the late 80s and its main theme is the aliens and thus the extraterrestrial.

[ System requirements ]

A minimum of a PAL Commodore Amiga computer with:
- Motorola 68000 cpu
- OCS chipset
- 512 KB of chip memory

Even if the intro is designed for Amiga OCS, it should run on every system.

[ How to run ]

- Unpack the archive
- cd PlanetR_V1_2
- PlanetR.exe

[ Background information ]

The scope of this intro was to fully understand and recreate the scrolling engine of the game Menace,
based on the assets made available by its original developers and free to use.

The original source code of the game written in 68K Assembly was only used as a reference,
infact the source code of this intro is written in good C and the scrolling engine itself is implemented in a different way.

This intro makes use of graphic assets of the first level of the game called Sea of Karnaugh.
