README for the Compositing Goodies
----------------------------------

These two little programs where just some test programs I did during the development
of the AmigaOS 4.1 Compositing engine. They where meant to be eventually turned into more
useful projects (Lens is still supposed to be turned into a commodity), but since 
I currently lack the time for that, I decided to put them up for download so that 4.1
users have something to play ;-)

Note that both ScreenThumb and Lens function on non-Compositing screens as well.

ScreenThumb:
------------

ScreenThumb, as its name implies, displays a thumbnail representation of your Workbench.
The command line template is 

WIDTH/N,HEIGHT/N,DELAY/N

WIDTH and HEIGHT specify the size of the thumbnail. DELAY is the number of milliseconds 
between updates. For smoother updates, try something like 50 or 10, but be aware that 
this raises CPU load.

Note that overlays are not displayed in the thumbnail (i.e. videos). If you want that, 
you need to disable usage of video overlays (for example the NOPIP option in DvPlayer.

Lens:
-----

Lens has no command line options. It will open a small window. In order to use it
(remember this ought to be a commodity really), you need to activate the window 
and press (and hold) the right mouse button. This will zoom the screen in on the 
mouse pointer. Move the mouse around to move the magnified area. The preview in the lower
right corner shows where you are currently located. The mouse wheel can be used to increase
or decrese the magnification. Releasing the right mouse button will zoom back out to normal.

Note that you cannot use the mouse pointer during the operation. I will fix that in the 
commodity version.

That's it really... Nothing uber-fancy, but it hints at some of the possibilities 
of the compositing engine.
