Program Title(s): Earth, Globe.C                       (C) L. Vanhelsuwé 1994

Author:           Laurence Vanhelsuwé


0. Short description:
   ------------------

   Earth    :  This program shows a real-time rotating Earth.
               You can rotate and zoom in or out with at least one joystick
               plugged in (2 are needed for full control).

               The small executable gets its data from the file "3D.Globe"

   Globe.C:    This is the C source to the program which converted a 2-D image
               of the world into a 3-D image-wrapped-on-a-sphere.

   EarthMap.IFF: Source picture to create the 3-D data using GLOBE.


1. Requirements/Installation:
   --------------------------

   To see the animation you need the data file '3D.Globe' in the current
   directory when Earth is run.

   Globe.c and EarthMap.IFF are not needed.


2. How to use it:
   --------------

   Simply install the program as outlined above.

   Joystick #1 controls Y-rotation and ZOOM.
   Joystick #2 controls X- and Z-rotation.

   Press FIRE BUTTON #1 to quit !!

   (Note that if, as usual, a mouse is plugged into port #1, then the program
   will interpret mouse moves as joystick changes...).


3. Internals:
   ----------

   Although the filename of the datafile is hard-coded to be '3D.Globe', the
   contents of that file could easily be replaced by another 3-D model.

   The format of the data file is ultra simple:

   WORD 0    :  number of (x,y,z) triplets in this model.

   WORD 1    :  X coordinate of point 0
   WORD 2    :  Y coordinate of point 0
   WORD 3    :  Z coordinate of point 0

   WORD 4    :  X coordinate of point 1
   WORD 5    :  Y coordinate of point 1
   WORD 6    :  Z coordinate of point 1

     :
     :

   WORD 3*n  :  X coordinate of point n
   WORD 3*n+1:  Y coordinate of point n
   WORD 3*n+2:  Z coordinate of point n

   That's right: the model is just a collection of unrelated points in space.
   A cloud of points !

   Since this kind of representation is much faster to render than polygon-
   (triangles in reality !)- based models, one can get quite stunning animations
   out of this renderer.


4. Limitations/Warnings:
   ---------------------

   No user-interface.
   No command line options.

**!! CRASH !!**

   Don't ZOOM the model in such that any model edges go off-screen... the pixel
   plotter doesn't clip and will scribble all over memory !!

5. History:
   --------

   Very long. Started in 1987 when I did a wireframe animation of the Space Shuttle.
   This code is a recent re-incarnation.

6. Future:
   -------

   Dependent on user's feedback.
