to: amiga programmers with lattice3.03 and kickstart1.1

i have released c language source code to the amiga3d demonstration program
(which has been tested to compile, link, load, and run using amiga v1.1 software
and the lattice 3.03 "c" development disk) to net.sources ...

this program is a real-time hidden-surface object-oriented three-dimensional
polygon rendering routine with moveable camera viewpoint. it was developed
by me in my "free time" and does not currently include object-to-object sorting.
one modified version has already been produced which displays stereoscopic
images in red-green format on a standard amiga display.

THIS CODE CAN BE FOUND UNDER: net.sources 
THERE ARE FOUR (4) FILES, TOTALLING ~105657 BYTES OF SOURCE CODE
THIS SOURCE IS FOR NON-COMMERCIAL USE ONLY.
NO WARRANTIES EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED ARE MADE FOR THIS CODE EITHER BY MYSELF OR BY COMMODORE-AMIGA.

have fun! yours,
