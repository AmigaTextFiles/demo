   Due the way OpenGL is implemented in AOS4 currently, this demo
   runs very slow. When we get proper 3D support it could be recompiled
   for a better result. Sorry for this. /Spot 

   The windowed and text mode isn't supported in the OS4 version.


   Oh... and try to run it with -pink as argument if you are feeling
   lonely or in the mood for something. =)

   Run it from the shell, with enough stack, "stack 500000" should suffice.

The Fiture Crew hombres are back for Icons'08 with...

fit-039: Boy

The source release: get datas from some other version and use -DNOSTRSEP if
your platform doesn't have it

Marq: codegfx, Roz: mzx

No texture maps or shaders were harmed during the making of this 
production. Thanks go to unknown image donors of the Internets and 
archive.org for the speech samples. The source will be available on our 
homepage (http://www.kameli.net/fit/) so feel free to port it to your 
preferred platform if it's not supported already. You may use the source 
as you wish on my behalf but because of the mpglib & SDL the license has
to be LGPL.

Some command line parameters even:
-nofsaa		No FSAA (ugly but fast)
-nosound	Silent mode
-w		Windowed mode
-res X Y	Set screen resolution. Only 4:3 modes run correctly.

PS. No, we're not going to start naming our demos fit-0xx, even though it
    seems to be kind of trendy these days
