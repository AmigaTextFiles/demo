Klide is a line art demo for the Commodore Amiga, and represents
my entry to the Badge Killer Demo Contest 2.  Klide is freely
distributable.

Klide should run on any current production model Amiga (500,1000,2000,
2500) with at least 512K memory, and may be run by making the Klide
drawer the current directory and either clicking on the Klide icon
or entering Klide from the CLI/Shell.
 
***  Double click the Left Mouse Button to terminate Klide.      ***
***  Single click the Left Mouse Button to advance sequence.     ***
***  Otherwise, Klide will automatically cycle through sequence. ***

If Klide is unable to obtain the memory resources that it needs, it
simply exits with a warning status code of 5.

Klide uses line mode blitter code developed by the author which is
capable of rendering short vectors at a rate up to 15,000 lines/second.
Klide was created using JForth and assembler for the Amiga by Delta
Research.
