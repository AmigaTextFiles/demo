To install: type make.
  (You may have to edit Makefile depending on where your SDL library is.)

To run: type ./main (windowed) or
             ./main -f (fullscreen)

Controls:
  to drop the ball, place the mouse pointer at the location from which you 
  wish the ball to begin its descent. (The mouse pointer location determines
  the ball sprite's upper left-most coordinate.)

Keyboard:
  b   = toggle background render on/off
  c   = print to stderr number of objects in list (not counting head)	
  p   = toggle palette switching on/off
  q   = exit the program
  ESC = same as q

Comments:
  Happier with the math, though still not using mass nor momentum.

To do:
  Add x axis functionality. Deal with momentum mathematically instead of 
  kludging.

(I apologize about the lengthy RCS log headers, I actually just learned RCS while writing this
 so you may imagine how such a thing could happen...)

Enjoy!
