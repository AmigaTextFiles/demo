Some words about this prod:
As the name of this demo sayz it was released for saving demo compo coz low amount of prods.
[How typical for amiga last years ;o(] So don't expect somethin' special...
Whole prod is a remake of LordNikon / Civitas prod called "Colorz"
Why is this a re-built version? Coz it was lost due HW crash.
After some months I made it again[steping twice into the same river;o)] There won't be absollutely no Final version of this shit coz I lost the motivation for making things like this ;o(
