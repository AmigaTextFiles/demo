********* AsteroidField.anim ********************************* 4 Sept, '88



To view, use Showanim version 4.2 or higher by typing:

      Showanim -c AsteroidField.anim

The -c option is used to force the animation into a continuous-loop.
To escape the animation, do a CTRL-C.


The animation is a HUGE 216 frames long, and was intended to be viewed full
screen in the interlace mode (352 X 440).  At this size and resolution, it
could never run at full speed, nor would you be able to store the animation
on a floppy disk.  This is why you see the gray border around the action.
This shrinks the effective screen size, and low resolution was used to
further reduce amount of data required to make the animation.

What is depicted is a spacecraft flying madly through an asteroid field
(chased by unseen foes) that includes a couple of near misses.  The fact
that the image was reduced to less than 25% it's original intended size and
that was further degraded by having only 50% of the intended pixel
resolution (low-res vs. interlace) makes the completed animation somewhee
around 12% of it's potential quality.  This would be a nice scene to be
saved to a VCR capible of single-frame recording.....  But I hope that you
think that the loss of resolution and image size is a good trade-off so that
1 meg users can store and see the animation from a standard floppy.  Even a
512K Amiga user should see a good portion of the animation....

If you have comments, or would like to discuss the creation of this
animation, I can be reached on the AMIC BBS in Santa Rosa Ca.
