Fit presents: Dr.Fungi

A quick funk production for macscene.org's iQuest 2002 compo. Haxored 
together in less than 60 hours. Originally for Mac OS X, versions for 
Windoze and Linux plus the source released afterwards.

cde:	Marq
	Ren/Halcyon
gfx:	Man
mzx:	Roz

Requires OpenGL and at least a 300MHz machine. Graphics and sound done
with SDL by Sam Lantinga (http://www.libsdl.org/). OSX version of the SDL
together with ATI's drivers may cause sudden system crashes and almost 
prevented us from entering the compo. Parameter -w from command line will 
run the demo in window.
