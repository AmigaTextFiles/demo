Type:     demo/mega
Requires: 1 MB ram
Version:  1.0

This is a demo written in AMOS Pro, lasting approx. 15 min.
It has several parts. It should work fine with all amigas, I
think. It was made using an old A500 KS 2.0, and I haven't tried
running it on anything else. I hope the speed of
f.ex. an A1200 won't make the timing wrong. The demo is 
compiled, but if you want the source-code, you can email me 
(danielb@ifi.uio.no) and I can uuencode it or something, 
if you are interested. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
First you will obviously need an empty disk.
Extract the archive using 'lha'. You have to copy certain
system files to the disk to make it work. These are:

c/Echo
c/endcli
c/Run

(If I don't remember wrong, only WB1.3/1.2 users will need those above,
 you will get an error code anyway if they are needed.)

devs/narrator.device

(I have used the WB2.0 version of the narrator.device, the WB1.3
 version is only half size or something and creates worse speech,
 but should also work, I think.) 

libs/diskfont.library
libs/translator.library

Now you will have to relabel the disk as 'DEMO1'.
Finally to make the disk bootable, you should use the 'install df0:'
command. One thing: The main program expects to find the data-files
in specific directories. Make sure the directory-structure from
the archive is restored on the disk. (I don't remember the option in 
lha, or if it is a default option)

I would appreciate feedback, even if you think this is thrash!
My email address is found above. 

PS: The last parts of the demo are the best ones, as the first parts
contain things I made long time ago.
