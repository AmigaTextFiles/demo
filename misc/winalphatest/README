This is just a small program I wrote to test some of the layer composition
features of AmigaOS 4.1 in the course of their implementation; it does not
serve any practical purpose beyond that.
However, since a few people asked for it to be released, here it is :)

It can be run either without arguments or with the name of an ARGB picture
file as argument.

When run without arguments, it will open a simple resizable window with an
alpha (transparency) map defined by the program itself.
You can switch between two example alpha maps by pressing any key; one map
describes a smooth round hole in the middle of the window, the other makes
the window borders semi-transparent.

When run with a picture name as argument, it will instead open a draggable
window using the picture's image and alpha channel for its shape.
It has no close gadget; you can close the window by double-clicking on it.

Note that layer composition must be enabled for this program to work.

Also note that it only works with pictures having an actual alpha channel,
like for instance 32-bit PNG files.

If you don't have a suitable ARGB picture handy, you might want to test it
with the sample images (such as the nice dice ;) which can be found on the
following web pages:

That's all, hopefully you'll have some fun with this useless program :)
