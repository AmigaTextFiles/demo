Bouncer is a 3-dimensional simulation of a bouncing ball written in
Creative Solutions' Multi-Forth.  The unarc'ed size of the file is on
the large side because I haven't taken the time to strip out all the
extra baggage.  The application was compiled on top of the default 
Multi-Forth system, then turnkeyed, so you can see that Multi-Forth
by itself isn't very large.

The source is largely the same as that which appeared in Volume 2,
Number 1 of Amazing Computing.  I cleaned up a few things and randomized
the initial velocities.  The major shortcoming of the demo is lack of
sound effects.  I have done some work with audio in recent issues of the
magazine, and I expect to go back and add stereo to the Bouncer sometime
soon.
