AMIGA DREAMS PORTFOLIO
======================
October 5 - November 25 1987
by Bradley W. Schenck

	These eight screens were created on an Amiga 500 using Electronic
Arts' DELUXE PAINT II and (in one instance) Newtek's DIGIPAINT.  Some
of the figures and picture elements were digitized from my pen-and-ink
sketches by Computer Visual Services of Loma Linda, California.
	This portfolio has been released by the artist into the public
domain.  Individuals, users' groups, and information services are
encouraged to distribute AMIGA DREAMS to all interested parties
subject to the following restrictions:

1.  No profitmaking enterprise is authorised to duplicate any part of
this portfolio.  While I have made this available, I still hold the
copyright on this work.  Anyone who would like to use this material
for other than the approved purposes should contact me at the address
below.	

2.  Keep all the contents of this file intact.  Everything is here for
a reason and the slideshow won't work properly if you trim the file
down.  (Contents include the eight pictures, the "show" command, the
slideshow script, "more", an excellent shareware program called
QUICKFLIX and its documentation, a buffer screen called "black", this
documentation, and the icons associated with the files.)  The pictures
which should be included here are:  TITLE, SERPENT, NORTH.LIGHT,
THE.TOWER, LADY.OTWAY, TREASURE, THE.DRAGON and THE.END.

	Please do note that QUICKFLIX is a shareware program.  If you
like it do The Right Thing by the authors.  For my own part, folks,
this one's for free.  But if you like my work, and see my name on a
commercial product someday, then don't doubt that I'll need the money.
 So buy it, eh?

Pax et Lux,
