; This is an example config file for
; $VER: PS3M 3.12ß / 20.09.1995
; by Jarno Paananen

; These are my own settings for my A500 + FAST and 68010
; Feel free to modify!


; These are comments and they must be on seperate lines
; All strings are case-insensitive and amount of spaces is not essential,
; but they make things c l e a r e r


; This first section describes the default settings that are
; used if no other settings are found in this file

[Defaults]

; Default mixing rate (useless as there are separate channel settings,
; but anyway)

Rate = 16000

; Default volume boost (also useless)
Boost = 0

; Default playing mode
;(surround, stereo, mono, real surround or 14-bit stereo)
Mode = Real Surround


; Default system state (on or off)
System = on

; Default module directory

Directory = xm:

; Mixing buffer size
; 0 = 4kB, 1 = 8 kB, 2 = 16 kB, 3 = 32 kB, default is 16kB.
; Smaller buffer gives faster response, but decreases the "backup"
; buffer possibly causing more "skipping".

; I've used 32kB recently due to the XM-support and my A500...

bufferSize = 3


; This toggles the startup banner (This program is made by the
; incredible and ever so wonderful and so on... ;)

Banner = off

; This line defines the font PS3M uses in format name.size.
Font = siesta.8


; This section describes the default settings for each number of channels
; Format is: number of channels = r[mixing rate] v[volume boost] m[mode]
; All are optional and if missing, the default is used.

; Yes! You can now also specify default playing modes for specific
; number of channels... (is it of some use, is another question...)

; An example:
; 17 = r10000 v4 m2

; The mode numbers are the same as with command line options, ie.
; 0 = Surround
; 1 = Stereo
; 2 = Mono
; 3 = Real surround
; 4 = 14-bit stereo

[Channels]

1 = r28000 v0
2 = r28000 v0
3 = r25000 v0
4 = r23000 v0
5 = r20000 v1
6 = r19000 v1
7 = r18000 v1
8 = r15000 v1
9 = r13500 v2
10 = r13000 v2
11 = r12000 v3
12 = r12000 v3
13 = r11000 v3
14 = r11000 v3
15 = r10000 v4
16 = r9000 v4


; This section describes settings for specific tunes
; The format is same as above, also playing mode.

s3m.2nd_pm = r17000 v1
mod.welcome = r28000 v0 m2
mod.toblerone = r26000 v0
mod.Banana boat = r28000 v0
seraph.xm = r14000 v2 m2
