                          =======================

  To start with the name, it is short for  CREative AMigites, which is what
we hope to be in the  future.  The  name  was  invented  by  @{"Won-Tolla" link wontolla}, who
actually @{"thought of it" link oldname} several years before the group got started.

@node oldname "Is this guy psychic or what?"

   Yes, as I just said the name is older than the group,  but I'm not real-
ly trying  to tell you  I thought of  it AS A  NAME FOR THIS  GROUP several
years  before it got started! What I mean is it's a couple of years since I
first thought something like "Wouldn't it be something to gather a group of
creative amigites?  I could call it, err, CreAm!"  The current group is not
exactly what I had envisioned back then, but it's a beginning...

@endnode

@node birthdates "Why don't we just say how old we are?"

  As you will notice when you start  looking  through this file, one of the
things you're told about  the  members  is  their birthdates. We originally
used just their ages, but then I (Won-Tolla) realised that information like 
that becomes outdated very quickly ("Sure, he says he's 17, but WHEN did he
say that?"), so we decided to use birthdates  instead; that way you can al-
ways calculate how old we are  right  now.  (And  besides  there's always a
chance that someone out there will send us birthday cards!)

  By the way, the dates are  given  in  Norwegian  format  (day-month-year)
rather than what seems to be the  Swedish  standard  (year-day-month), even
for the Swedes. Hey, I'm the one  writing  this file, I've got to have some
privileges, you know! :-)

                             -----------------

  In the late summer of '94, our  @{"leader-by-default"link leaderbydefault}  (later  to be known as
@{"Scarycat" link scarycat}) inserted an ad in various Scandinavian Amiga mags [Well, two that
I know of actually...]. It  got  answered  by  various people, some of whom
seemed to lose interest before  we  got  anything  done.  At least Scarycat
claims he never received anything  from  some of the original "members", or
they started taking too long to answer his letters.

  That's it really... Unless you want to see @{"ScaryCat's version" link origin}.

@node pennameexp "'Pen names'?"
                  What's this business about "pen names"?
                  ---------------------------------------

  One of my (Won-Tolla's) little pet peeves. @{"Scarycat" link scarycat}, our esteemed @{"leader-" link leaderbydefault}
@{"by-default" link leaderbydefault}, insists on using the more traditional  term "code names", but I
insist that this term suggests that  we  are using the names to conceal out
@{"true identities" link realnames}, as if we've got something to hide. Well, we've GOT nothing
to hide (Maybe except for our  lousy  skills  ;-)),  so I suggested using a
different term. In the beginning I  tried  introducing  the term "aliases",
but have now settled for "pen names" instead,  hoping it will catch on bet-
ter than "aliases".
  [Of course,  Amigites rarely  use  pens,  but  "mouse names" or "keyboard
names" is a bit too weird even for us...]

@endnode
  
@node whatitis  "Let me explain..."
                               What is this?
                               -------------

  Well, it's a slide show with a fancy (?) intro and some home-made picture
transition effects we  hope  you  will  like.  The  title was thought up by
@{"Scarycat" link scarycat}, who thought he should be  the  first to name a production because
he is the leader. [I will probably  be  next  because I've got imagination!
;-) -- WT]
  Later we may come up with something a bit  more fancy (and CREative), but
at the time being we are a lot of  artists  with  just one musician and one
programmer (Well, there are several members  who claim to program, but only
one has had the guts to prove it so far! :-))
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  By the way, the program goes through the pictures twice, first at its own
pace, then you set the pace. So you can stare at (or rather through) Scary-
cat's stereograms for a couple of  minutes  if  you like. If you want to go
"manual" before reaching the end of the first round, just press the Esc key
until the music starts to fade. When  the  new music starts, you can change
pictures by clicking the mouse (but you  won't get my intermission message,
and you don't get a second look!).

                         Where do we go from here?
                         -------------------------

  Well, apart from being the title of  a  song  it's also the question with
the vaguest answer.  After taking nearly a year  to get a little slide show
together, we hope of course  to  move  on  to bigger and better things (and
get them done a bit faster too! :-)),  but that's all in the future. (Where
else? :-))

  And who knows,  once all our artists have learned to draw behind the tool
box we may even start exploring overscan mode! :-)

@node arcade "Who is Arcade?"

  Mattias "Arcade" Bengtsson  (29.08.78)  is  the group's only (active) mu-
sician so far. He wrote both the tracks  - the first one, which he for some
reason refers to as "that superb  tune  which should be repeating itself in
your head by now" [At  least  it  keeps  repeating  in  MY head, but that's
mainly because I ran the program fifty times to test it during development!
-- WT] is called is called "Look out", the other "New Hope".
  He also drew the CreAm logo in  the intro,  and even  found  time between
tunes to contribute a couple of pictures:  his own logo and a couple called
@{"Lady Death" link arcpics} and  @{"Spt" link arcpics}  (whatever  that  means,  it's  supposed  to  be a long
distance shot of a spaceship that presumably  didn't stay long enough for a
closeup).

@node arcpics "A note about Arcade's pictures"

  [Actually he made both a colour and  b/w  version of the first, and iden-
tical versions, with and without  interlace,  of  the second... I have also
experimented with combining the two,  i.e.  removing the spaceship and put-
ting the lady in the foreground  instead,  but  that picture isn't included
because it would be about as repetitive  as including both versions of both
his pictures!]

  To repeat his own words again [Well,  I've  got nothing better to do with
them haven't I? -- WT], Mattias  (or  Arcade  if  you  prefer) lives in the
beautiful town of Trollhättan [To  venture  a guess, the name seems to mean
something like "troll's hood". Oh,  and  the ä is  pronounced "eh".], about
nine metric miles from Gothenburg [Where @{"Mr. Fish" link fish} lives, if he's still with

made.

@endnode

@node arcadename  "What does that stupid name stand for?"

  Contrary to popular  belief  [Well,  I  used  to  believe it...] the name
Arcade has nothing to do with a  certain  X-Men villain, but it may have at
least a little to do with arcade games. Back in his C64 days when he got on 
the highscore table of a game, he  would  enter his initials as ARC because
his proper initials JMB didn't  look  very  interesting!  The initials were
supposed to stand for Actually  Really  Cool,  and later developed into the
full name ARCADE. [Suggestions for what the rest of the name may be an abb-
reviation for are welcome! -- WT]

@endnode

@node arcadeware "What has Arcade got?"

  Arcade does not like to  rattle  of  all  he's  got  because  he does not
believe in the "whoever has the most  toys  when they die wins" philosophy,
but after the usual rounds of  torture  he admitted being in the possession
of an A500 with a 400M hard  drive  [Drat,  that  means he wins...! -- Won-
Tolla's 212M drive], a MIDI interface and  a poly 800 keyboard that is "old
as hell, even older than Won-Tolla,  and  he's  really old". [Wouldn't that
mean it isn't MIDI compatible?]

@endnode

@node arcadework "What does Arcade do?"

  Arcade is one of Marvel's numerous crazy  assassins whose specialty is to
make his assignments into a  game...  Whoops,  sorry,  wrong character! OUR
Arcade writes music (with Protracker  "because  he  likes it so much"), and
whenever he's not being bossed around by ScaryCat or not  working (huh?) on
another tune for the group's  next  release,  he  just takes it easy. [Wise
fellow!] He liks to draw and  write  (and  animate,  according  to SC), amd
whenever he manages to tear himself away from the Amiga, he loves to PARTY!

He used to be a member of Zaxxion, but is now a member of "The One And Only

  [To quute the proverb (?), that's all he wrote. He was really supposed to
be edited out along with some other members who didn't send  more info, but
he's a  bit special  at least as far as our neighbours in the east are con-
cerned (as you saw in the member listing and wil find out more about if you

  And for those who really didn't  know,  the original Paddington being re-

the Paddington railway station in  London,  which in turn got its name from
the district it's located in.  And  if  you  think I'm going to stop there,
you're wrong - I happen to have  a  placename  dictionary  which informs me
that the name originally means  "Padda's  Farm",  so there must have been a
farm there once, associated with (but not  owned by) one Mr. (?) Padda, who
presumably didn't know that his (?) name means "the Newt" in modern Norweg-
ian!!

@endnode

  Of course there is a rational explanation  for the misspelling: If he had

@{"Pink Floyd" link pink} song (Is THERE AnyBODY Out There).)

  Errr... this is really conjecture;  I don't KNOW if  that is where he got
the title from (at least the picture does not look like anything I envisage
while  listening to  the song...).  I guess  I could just  ask him but that
would probably make reading this file less entertaining... (??)

  Well, here's one I know for a change! :-) That's because I am the one who
made it up for him. Because  his  initials  spell  BOO,  I got the idea for
something "scary", and  a  scarycat  is  supposed  to  be the opposite of a
scarEDYcat.

  (Of course, if you  insert his pen name  between the middle and last name
the way it's done in the credits and some places in this file, his initials
suddenly become BOSO, which is NOT the same as a "bozo"! (It's only the im-

@node scarycatware "What has Scarycat got?"
  
  Apart from a big ego ;-), Scarycat used  to have an Amiga 500+, a printer

came with a hard disk (to  be  replaced  with  a  bigger one), a genlock, a

depending on when you read this!),  and  he's waiting impatiently for Escom
to start bringing out the new 1200s...

  As I have mentioned several time already (and you have read several times
if you read this more or less in the order  I write it), Bård "Scarycat" is
our leader-by-default. The reason I call  him that is simply that he became
the leader because he started  the  whole  thing  (see "@{"How did it start?" link history}")
and, presumably, because noone else wanted the job!
  [Actually, of late (summer 95) I've been so active with shaking the other
members out of their sleep,  some of them have suggested that *I* should be
the leader... Don't know, there may be some changes next time we meet...]

  He stresses that if you contact him, you must spell his name correctly. I
guess there's a lot of people with nearly  similar names living on the same

their names misspelled, my family wrote the book!)

@node warlockname "What does that stupid name stand for?"

  To paraphrase the warlock for a change (the other nodes quote him more or
less directly), he picked the main part  of his name because he has "always
loved magical dudes", and because  there  have been so many warlocks before
he decided to number himself¹, and  seven  is supposed to be a magical num-
ber. "So there, that's all there is to it!"

¹Of course it has nothing to do with the  fact that picking a name that be-
gins with a number would have  put  him  first  in  a machine-sorted member
list, but I tricked him - the  list  at  the  start  of this file is sorted
manually, and in my book 7 begins with "Se". Ha! ;-)

@node wontolla "Who is Won-Tolla?"

  Ragnar "Won-Tolla" Fyri (12.01.@{"57" link 57}) is the group's first active programmer
(Okay, so it's just Amos, but at  least  that's a beginning...). He did all
the programming for the intro  and  the  slide  show, and is also the third
"artist" represented in this slide show. He drew his own logo and persuaded
Imagine to come up with the  two  following  pictures  (Eye  and CreAm With
Coffee... or something like that). [Actually  they are both test renderings
of unfinished projects, but Scarycat  wanted  to  include them anyway! Look
for finished (?) versions in later publications...]
  When it was  found that we  could use  some more pictures,  he heroically
descended into  his old  disk pile and came  up with a two more pictures, a
variant of what later became his logo (and an exercise in gradients)  and a
kind of satellite picture that started as an experiment with brush effects!

@node 57 "What's so special about that date then?"

  Right, born in -57, that makes me  the  oldest member and also a bit spe-
cial in two other ways. Of  late  I  have  developed  the  habit of telling
people who inquire about my age that  I  am  of the same vintage as @{"Ernie's" link ernie}
DeSoto!
  1957 was also the year when King Haakon  the 7th died (which is why I can
always remember what year it  happened!).  He  died much later in the year,
though, so you could say that I have just barely lived under three kings to
date (1995).

@endnode

@node ernie "Who the hell is Ernie?"

  Either you are one of those people  who  klick on everything in sight, or
you gave up reading newspaper  comic  strips  when  they started shrinking.
Surely you've heard of Ernie Floyd from  Bayonne (?) and his trusty (rusty)
57 DeSoto? If not, just pick up some  newspaper  and a magnifying glass and
look around a bit...

  This may be as good a place as any to mention that I'm also interested in
comics, so if we ever get a plot together  and get the artists to cooperate
it's quite possible that one of our future  publications will be a comic on
disk (or maybe even on paper...).

  (By the way, in case it should interest  anyone, my favourite Ernie strip
(so far!) is the one where Spencer  has  found  a new way to get money from
adults - by telling them he wants to be just like them when he grows up. It
works fine until he tries it on  Uncle  Sid,  and if you don't remember the
punchline you've got one more excuse for @{"writing me" link wontollahome}!)

@node wontollaname "What does that stupid name stand for?"
  
  Well, what do you know? I know this one  too! :-) I got the name from the
Jungle Book (click @{"here" link junglequote} for details).  The  reason I picked this particular
name (rather than Hathi, that  was  my  name  as  a "wolf cub" ages ago) is
very simple really.  One day a couple  of years back I got in touch with an
amigite who called  (and for  all I  know  is  still calling) himself "Lone
Wolf" because he did not belong  to  any  group.  I found that I was in the
same situation, but I couldn't exactly steal the name, so I started looking
for something similar.  Then I  remembered Won-tolla, a  name which  freely
translated  can mean  "lone wolf".  It's  a bit paradoxal  to use it within
a group, but it's all I've got, and at  least it's  better than  some names
I could (but won't) mention...
  
@endnode
  
@node junglequote "Short excerpt from a classic."
  
   The following is quoted from  the  Kipling  story "Red Dog":
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   They heard tired feet  on the rocks, and a gaunt wolf, streaked with red
on his flanks, his right  fore-paw useless,  and his  jaws white with foam,
flung himself into the circle and lay gasping at Mowgli's feet.
   "Good hunting! Under whose Headship?" said Phao gravely.
   "Good hunting! Won-tolla am  I," was the  answer. He meant that he was a
solitary wolf,  fending for himself,  his mate and  his cubs in some lonely
lair, as do many wolves  in the south. Won-tolla means an Outlier - one who
lies out from any Pack.  Then he panted, and they could see his heart-beats
shake him backward and forward.
   "What moves?"  said Phao,  for that  is the question all the Jungle asks
after the _pheeal_ cries.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Well, if you want to know what was moving in the Jungle that day and how
my namesake got  into such a state, I recommend a trip to the library where
you can no doubt  find a copy of The Second Jungle Book, which is where the
rest of the story can  be found.  But if  all you  want to know is why this
miserable wolf is my namesake, just click Retrace and read on.
@endnode

@node wontollaware "What has Won-Tolla got?"
  
  Won-Tolla is somewhere in  the  middle  as  far as being well-equipped is
concerned. Since the  beginning  of  the  computer  age,  he's gone through
several  different computers, of  which he still  has an Apple ][+, a C128,
his first Amiga  (a 500 version 1.2)  and the  one he's currently using, an
Amiga 500+ with a hard disk that keeps threatening  to run over, extra disk
drive and RAM (total 12 MB), a sampler that doesn't work and a streamer and
a Zip drive that do.  He's also kept his first printer which he got for the
Apple (mostly because noone else wants it), but also has a (relatively) new
and much better bubble jet printer. As soon as he can afford to get a phone
he'll (probably) also get a modem.
  
@endnode
  
@node wontollawork "What does Won-tolla do?"
  Well, well! What does he NOT do?  Won-Tolla  programs  a lot - he started
with various Basics (and a little  6502)  on his older machines, "advanced"
to AmigaBasic, and is now mostly  converted to Amos. He's got DICE and True
Basic installed on the hard disk as  well,  but  hasn't really got very far
with either as there are so many  other  and  more fun things to do with an
Amiga than learning a new programming language...
  He also likes to play with Imagine  (as previously  mentioned, two of his
contributions to this slide  show  are  test  renders)  and experiment with
stills and animations  in  DeluxePaint,  and  recently started on his first
MovieSetter creation (probably only to be released in Norway, so don't hold
your breath!). Also plays a bit with  OctaMED,  but  isn't too good at this
either.
  When he's not trying to be creative,  he spends far too much time playing
computer games, quarreling with  Scarycat  ;-)  and playing PBM games. He's
also currently looking for a  job after his boss went  and died on him last
year...

Oh yes,  he also  writes the  occasional limerick, as seen on the @{"real name" link realnames}
page!  (They usually  rhyme better, too!  Come on,  how many  words can YOU
think of that rhyme on "Amigites" or "demo"?)

                                             By ScaryCat - 1995

  Well boys and  girls,  Ragnar  "Won-Tolla"  Fyri has  written  over seven
hundred lines in this file, so  I  guess  I'll  have to spit in a couple of
sentences too. [With a bit of help from the editor, whose English and logic
is better than his. (Well, he said so himself! At least about the English.)
-- WT] As the acting leder of CREative  AMigites I try as hard as  possible
to pull the strings and keep the members in the group from  collecting each
others' heads... Well, usually they  are  very nice too each other, but I'd
rather keep a certain control over them.
  (Well I haven't had a difficult job so far since the other members do not
seem to want to contact each other  personally...  besides going through me
at first...) [It's just much easier  to  write to him when he's supposed to
keep in touch with everyone anyway! -- WT]

  Anyway...  whether you want it or not, I will tell you how I got the idea
of  starting CreAm.  I've been into computers  since 1992 and the first two
years I only  played games. But then  I  thought, "There MUST be more to it
than only  being able to play  games!?",  and it was then I started drawing
pictures in Deluxe Paint 3. Now I am using Deluxe Paint 4 [But he ain't got
no manual... -- WT], which  is  my  favourite   program.  HEY!!!  I DO HAVE
OTHERS TOO!!! Such as TRUE BRILLIANCE,  PROFESSIONAL DRAW, IMAGINE 2.0, and
some others which I don't bother  to    mention.  [Of course he has to have
more than one program to name  one  of  them  his  favourite! See my remark
about logic in the opening! -- WT]

  Anyway... in the spring of 1994 I  tried  to  join the group BEHIND BARS;
at that time I  called myself ASAP.  Silly name, ehh!!??  [Stop stealing my
lines! -- WT]
  Anyway, for about 2 months I lived  in  the belief that I finally had be-
come something, but then one day I  got  this  letter from the leader of BB
saying that I never had been a  member,  and he kicked my ass so  to speak.
So, Mr. Criminalis/BEHIND BARS, if you ever get the chance to  read this, I
hope you can see that I ain't as  stupid  as  you wrote the last time [He's
worse! :-) -- WT]. Now you've got COMPETITION!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOOD LUCK!!!!!!
(Actually I think it IS time for you to go BEHIND BARS... ha!!)

  YES....YES..I  SHALL  CONTINUE!!!!!!!!  As  you probably have reckoned, I
went mad and  my  nice  ego  said  to  me  (translated  from  Norwegian  of
course..): "Make your own group, and  show  those  assholes that you can do
just as well as them." [In  other  words,  if  you  can't find a group that
wants you, start one that does!  :-)  --  WT]  That was IT. I put an adver-
tisement in 3 computer magazines,  and  a lot [Well, half a dozen... -- WT]
of Amiga enthusiasts answered it. Yup!!! That's how CreAm was started.
  The first to answer was Ragnar "Won Tolla"  Fyri... [Editor takes a bow.]
so because he also is the oldest of  us...he  has been the one who also has
answered most  and   therefore  become  my  closest  right-handed member in
CreAm. [Actually I'm  part  ambidextrous...  Oh,  he means right-hand man I
guess... -- WT]
  If anyone out there with an AMIGA reads this [Let's face it, you'd have a
tough time reading it WITHOUT an Amiga! -- WT], then you are all welcome to
@{"write to me" link scarycathome} if you have questions [Like "Why bother?" :-) --WT], and if you
are lucky then perhaps I  will answer YOU!!!  [Or @{"write ME" link wontollahome}, I try to answer
EVERYONE. -- WT]
  AND IT WOULD ALSO BE COOL IF ANY  OF  YOU  WHO  SEE THIS FIRST SLIDE SHOW
FROM CreAm COULD @{"WRITE TO ME" link scarycathome} AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK OF IT. [Not if they
are honest! :-) -- WT]

  PS: If you don't write English [but can read it well enough to understand
this... -- WT] you can @{"write" link scarycathome} to me in French.  But PLEASE don't @{"write" link scarycathome} to ME
in GERMAN, since I will not be able to understand any of it. [Jawohl! --WT]
Errr... @{"write" link scarycathome} only short  FRENCH letters  since I only have had one year of
French at school.  [He means  letters in French,  but you could always @{"send" link scarycathome}
him a "French letter" too -  he's  got  other  "amigas" than his Amiga, you
know! -- WT]


                            Ha det!
                            Bye!
                            Au Revoir!

@node nosoft "Screw the hardware, I want to know about your software!"

  As you will find when you click the "What has he got?" button to the left
of the one you just clicked to get here (unless you're >browsing of course)
this file limits itself to listing the hardware used by members.
  There is a simple reason for this:  Anyone  who  has had an Amiga (or any
other computer) for some time will  have  accumulated hundreds of programs,
or at least far too many to list.  [When  I  found that one of the members,
who shall remain anonymous, had  included  such trivialities as Relokick on
his list, I realised I was on the wrong  track.] We could of course include
a list of the programs each member  uses  most frequently, but that is sort
of implicit in the "What does he do?" entry,  and we're trying to avoid too
much redundant information here...
