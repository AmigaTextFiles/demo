  Picture Garden 2 is collage-generator slide show written in AMOS.
  It's a freeware re-write of an old (Fish 206) AmigaBasic program,
  with improvements like overscan and a hidden mouse pointer.

  The pictures are drawn using AMOS's Polyline and Polygon commands.
  The code that draws the pictures was created using Collage Coder,
  a variation on the programming tool AMOS Art Coder.

  The first time you run the program you have to center the screen
  with the mouse.  A tiny file called "PictureGarden.config" gets
  written to your S: directory that centers it thereafter.  If you
  center it wrong, delete S:PictureGarden.config and try again.
