The primary reason to install and share this demo is to SELL 
AMIGAS! You are becoming part of a cause. It will make you feel 
good, tap your feet, and be happy to be part of the Amiga 
community. Look carefully at each objective. What is your part? 
Developers, users, dealers, and potential users all have something 
to gain. Use and enjoy...

This demonstration should be considered an editorial. It is the 
outline of a much more detailed and implementable plan based on 
classical strategy, common sense, and grass-roots evangelism. It is 
NOT a commercial product. It is NOT from Commodore. It is NOT an 
officially endorsed marketing plan. But, please get something out 
of it.


--------------------------  INSTALLATION  ---------------------------
                             Very easy!

Commodore® The Marketing Plan is distributed on 2 floppy diskettes 
and must be installed and assembled on a hard drive. System 
requirements are a minimum of 3M hard drive space, 1M chip RAM, and 
3M total RAM. Make sure there is about 200K free on your main system 
(or boot) partition for the Scala library and device. The demo has 
been tested with Workbench 1.3 and 2.04. Each diskette has one piece 
of  the demo (represented with a puzzle icon). They are named 
One_Piece and Other_Piece. 

Demo assembly: Drag both pieces of the demo into the same location 
on your hard drive. This will take less than a minute for each 
piece. Double-click either of the puzzle icons on your hard drive. 
As long as both pieces are located together, a window will open,
and the  assemble procedure will ask you to confirm your decisions. 
Answer y. 

If the Scala files are already installed on your system, you will be 
asked whether you want the version 29.5 files installed. If you 
answer yes, the old Scala files will be renamed and preserved
in their appropriate drawer (in case of Scala version problems).
If you encounter problems running the Scala program, restore the
files to their original names (through CLI or a directory utility)
or obtain the new version of Scala.

The application will finish assembling itself and FixFonts will be 
automatically run (as long as you have not moved it out of its 
system drawer).

Simply close and open the drawer to see and run the assembled demo. 
The demo is interactive, but if left alone it will run using its 
own automated default timing. You may random-access the Briefing 
section of the demo by clicking the About button and selecting one 
of the tiny pictures. Make sure your stereo audio is hooked up! The 
music will stop after a few minutes and will resume after fully 
completing the About section.

Behavior of the buttons: Play with the application to fully 
understand the way the buttons behave. You should always wait until 
a highlighted button becomes unhighlighted before clicking to 
proceed. If you wish to bypass a sequence after it has begun, click 
the right mouse button. If you wish to start the sequence over, 
click the left mouse button. To escape the demo, press the escape 
key.


----------------------------  CREDITS  ------------------------------

1) SCALA from Digital Vision / Scala Corporation / G.V.P. was the 
   application development tool.
2) The demo was designed on an Amiga 3000 with lots of RAM and tested 
   on an Amiga 2500.
3) Imagine from Impulse was used to generate the 3D Commodore logo 
   spaceship sequence.
4) ADPro from ASDG was used to convert the 24 bit animation to 1/4 
   screen H.A.M.
5) DCTV from Digital Creations was used for the digitizing.
6) Deluxe Paint IV from Electronic Arts was used for all other 
   graphics.
7) WBScript (ShareWare program) from Howard Harrison is used for 
   running and installing.
8) LhA archiver program from Stefan Boberg is used for unarchiving 
   during the assembly.
9) mod.ResonanceII music by Dr. Bully.

For more information on the plan, contact Mike Levin of the 
Philadelphia Amiga Users' Group by voice at 215-487-0440. 
Fax: 215-739-7994. 

For professional 3D graphics, contact Marc Rifkin at 215-825-3138.

Mike Levin and Marc Rifkin may also be contacted electronically at 
The Philadelphia Amiga Users' Group BBS: 215-551-6113, 215-551-1120, 
215-551-1120. Settings: 8,N,1 or on the FidoNet Amiga User Group 
conference. 

We encourage that each and every Amiga owner write an article about
how they use the Amiga, or about the exciting things their user group
is doing. Are you already somehow promoting the Amiga? How? Would you
like to flesh-out the Marketing Plan with some implementable tactics?
Does your user group demo at shopping malls or shows? Do you host
community activity animation workshops? Is your user group connected
to a school? (These are all part of Objective #1 of course).

You can get the articles to me over the Philadelphia Amiga Users'
Group BBS, or mail a diskette and/or hardcopy to attn: Mike Levin, 
Philadelphia Amiga Users' Group, PO Box 21186, Philadelphia, PA
19154-0386.

Articles will be published in the Blitter; the Journal of the
Philadelphia Amiga Users' Group. People who write will be making
a difference. It will be time well spent and benefit all the parties
involved. The articles and information will serve to validate the 
plan and make it viable. The Blitter has generated verifiable 
results. If you wish to recieve the Blitter, join the Philadelphia
Amiga Users' Group by sending a check for $20 to the above address.
Please include your mailing address and phone number.

Be in touch soon.
Please make your choice...


--------------------------  DISTRIBUTION  ---------------------------

At the time of this writing, I have not decided whether or how to
distribute this demo. Much of that depends on what it is intended to 
accomplish. At the minimum, it is a tiny demonstration of Marc Rifkin 
and my own (Mike Levin) abilities. We are both going on the job 
market.

If it is distributed, it must be in it's original form: 

1) It must include the Read_Me file.
2) Nothing must be altered including the icons, script, files, etc.
3) Use the installation procedure.

This means that if this application is distributed with modems or
telecommunications, each disk (Disk1 and Disk2) should be archived 
with a full-disk compressor such as Disk Masher (DMS) or Zoom.

The temptation will exist for people to archive the demo from
their hard drive with a backup utility for distribution. I ask
that this not be done because it will cause nothing but trouble:
files will be lost and paths will be ruined. The original 2 disk set
includes a magical, nearly fail-safe installation procedure.
Use it! If you are curious how it works, look at the tool types and
default tool in the puzzle piece icon information window. 


-----------------------------  LABELS  ------------------------------

If you want to produce really cool labels for your disk, you will
find a file called "Labels.PageStream2.0" on Disk1. It requires 
PageStream 2.0 and the Triumvirate Bold CompuGraphic font (which 
comes with PageStream) in order to print. When you select Print
from PageStream, make sure you select the "Negative Print" option!
This will make the lables have their correct black background.

It will print a page with 4 sets of labels. This is the recommended
procedure to get the labels onto the disk:

1) CAREFULLY cut out a set of labels.
2) Make the label into a sticker with something such as spray 
   adheshive (available at most art stores).
3) Carefully center and apply the label to the diskette.

If done properly, this will produce a very attractive and lasting
label which will make you feel better about yourself and the demo.
I accept no responsibility for damage created by poorly executed
labels.
