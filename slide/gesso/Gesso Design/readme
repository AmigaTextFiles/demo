                       pRESENTs: gESSo dESIGn


 Hi! I know, this production has 3 years. It's old and wrinkled up. But most people
haven't seen it, since it's never been released on Aminet. I decided to upload it to
serve one main purpose: to show people (mainly portuguese people) what was it like 
when we had a scene back here in Portugal. Well.. we never had a *real* scene, it was 
just too small. But sceners released stuff nonetheless. Until one day.. puff! Anyway,
i hope the portuguese scene will resurface one day! I also hope you like the slideshow
(you can at least laugh at it!). Drop me a message in any case!

 PS1- Fox really makes better gfx now (especially renders ;). Expect a slideshow with 
      some of his new gfx soon!
 PS2- I don't code in AMOS anymore. ;)
 PS3- Killer Kid remains a great musician and works freelance for several game companies
      including Vulcan and his own company Black Flag.



 INSTALLATION:

 This was supposed to come in .dms archives but since Aminet isn't
supporting them anymore.. Anyway installation to floppy is easy:

 - copy these files and drawers to a disk labeled ZE'!: 
    "gesso", "phase4", "pp", "setpatch", "devs", "fonts", "libs", "s"

 - go to a shell and type: install df0:

 - copy drawers "c" and "pics" to a disk labeled BRAIN

 - that's it!


 Installation to HD isn't possible, i didn't make an HD install script back then
and even if i wanted to make one now i couldn't since i don't have the source to the
slideshow anymore. For some reason it doesn't work with simple assigns. I think it
needs to be booted from disk 1. Probably something to do with the versions of the
libraries..
