@NODE AboutLODGE "About LODGE..."
In 1991 I bought an Amiga 500 after using a ZX Spectrum 128 for 4 years.
Dealing with the Amiga after years of fiddling around with the Spectrum 
seemed to be more difficult than I expected. Luckily I knew someone who 
already owned an Amiga, and he explained the basics to me well enough so
I didn't drop the Amiga. The Amiga owning circle of friends grew and at 
the moment there are five of them.
Since the summer of 1992 we form a software development group. Initially 
we called ourselfs 'TBL' (The Black Lodge), after the evil shadow world 
from David Lynch's 'Twin Peaks' series.
A few weeks ago, after we released our first finished piece of software
called 'The AGA Experience' and received some very nice responses, 
but also a less pleasant message. The Swedish group  'The Black Lotus' 
were (rightfully) objecting to us using the abbreviation 'TBL', because 
they have been using it since 1988 for their group. We're not lame, so 
we immediatly changed the name of our group to LODGE, keeping some of 
the original name intact. Officialy LODGE is an abbreviation of:

@{b}The LODGE AGA Experience Demo@{ub}
A demo everyone with an Amiga 1200 or 4000 should have. It's great! All
those colours make you glad you have an AGA Amiga! Expect new versions
soon!

@{b}Valkyr's Non Productivity Tools@{ub}
This range of nice screen hacks and un-utilities is available from AmiNet.
Check them out, they are quite funny.

@{b}TimeCalc v1.0@{ub}
This program took us almost 3 year to complete. Now it is finally available
on Aminet. It is a very comprehensive clock and calendar program with a
host of unique options. At the moment the source-code is rewritten to make
it function even better than it does already. There are also plans for a
professional version in the pipeline. Keep watching the Net!
@{i}(ETA: Late fall 1995)@{ui}

@{b}StripHTML v1.1@{ub}
StripHTML is available from Aminet. With it you can remove all those 
useless HTML codes, so you can print WWW texts with any old word processor.

@{b}Cartograph@{ub}
Hmmm... This is a bit of a neverending story. When the development of this
program continues at it's current pace, it will be available around the
summer of 2003. (probably) :o(

@{b}Breakin' Briks v1.0@{ub}
Now this is it. It's a great Breakout clone for AGA Amiga's. The version
currently available from Aminet will ASAP be updated with an even better
version. If you liked Megaball, you'll love Breakin' Briks.

@{b}Cyber Cycles@{ub}
This program is not exactly ready to be released. A lot of graphics work 
and fine tuning has to be done. We hope the game will be available before 
the end of 1996. One things for sure: it will be very fun to play! :)

@{b}Very Important Pixels@{ub}
Well, you're looking at it right now... Check it out!

@{b}ChartMaker@{ub}
With this program you can make... charts! (what's in a name?) Details on
this program are very vague, so you'll have to wait until it appears in
the recent list of Aminet, sometime at the end of this century...

@{b}Currently untitled shoot 'm up@{ub}
This one is in a very early stage. It will involve hords of aliens to kill,
multidirectional scrolling, AGA graphics and a great soundtrack. As I said
before: "@{i}Keep your eyes on the Aminet recent list!@{ui}"

@{b}D. Lusion's Module Collection@{ub}
A large collection of Protracker modules made in recent years by the
musical LODGE member D. Lusion. The collection can be found in the MODS
directory of Aminet. 

Of course there are more plans, but they are very very unfinished.
Amongst the future projects is VIPS II, with glorious AGA pictures 
of more (recent) famous people...

@NODE MakingOfVIPS "The making of VIPS..."

The pictures in this archive were originaly intended to be in a slideshow 
called 'VIPS - Very Important Pixels'. As you will notice they are all in 
320*256*16 format.
This is because when the pictures were digitized in the summer of 1992 I 
had no access to an AGA-Amiga. I'm not even sure if I ever heard of AGA 
back then...
The pictures were grabbed by Andre Haberkorn from a VHS video tape using 
the Rombo VidiAmiga frame grabber. The pictures formed a television advert 
for 'De Krant op Zondag' (Newspaper on Sunday) which doesn't exist anymore.

The musical score was composed and programmed by @{"D. Lusion." LINK DLusion}
He made a special 1995 re-mix of the original 1992 soundtracker module for
this Aminet release.

The ShowVIPS IFF viewer was programmed by @{"Valkyr" LINK Valkyr} and is a (very) sneak 
preview of his upcoming slideshow viewer which at this moment hasn't
got a name... It's still quite buggy, so use at your OWN risk!
Valkyr also solved some big problems concerning the ill behavior of the
AmigaGuide System command. The smart guys and gals amongst you will 
understand what I'm talking about... Again: Use the solution at your
OWN risk.
