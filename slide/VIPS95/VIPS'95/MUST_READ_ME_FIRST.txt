Important notes!

This slideshow uses the AmigaGuide format, useable with
Amiga's with KS3+. Users with Kickstarts below 3.0 can't
use this slideshow in an interactive way. By using a IFF
shower (like in DiskMaster, DOpus etc.) the pictures CAN
be viewed on ANY Amiga. The music is in an executable
format and can be started by running the file 
"ThemeFromVIPS'95" from CLI or a disk manager program. On
some fast Amigas the music can sound a bit odd. We're
sorry about this. The probolem lies with the program 
MODprofessor, which was used to create the exe file.

Before you start the VIPS slideshow, please make sure that
the MultiView command is in the directory called 'Utilities'
on the root of your hard disk. If you installed Workbench
using the Commodore script it should be there. If not so,
you'll have to create a directory called 'Utilities' on 
the 'SYS:' partition of your hard drive.

Although this slideshow was designed for use with Amigas
equipped with a hard disk, it is possible to run it from
floppy. All the files, including the executeables, should
therefore be crunched using PowerPacker or a similar
file cruncher. To run VIPS from disk, you also need to
create a custom startup-sequence and place the correct
libraries on the disk.

Check the AmigaGuide text with a text editor to see how
you can use the Link System command for your own Guides!
I've noticed some people on Amiga newsgroups who asked
how they could run exe files from an AmigaGuide doc. It
is a fact that the original Commodore manual didn't tell
much about this subject, nothing at all actually! (LAME!)
Well look at the file and find out. There are some more
tricks to be found there, feel free to experiment!
