 This is the new slideshow from Darkness.

 Code :   PSB		fgoucem@samoa.unice.fr
 Artwork: Rafale	sdebono@samoa.unice.fr
 Music:   Savy

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Requirements:

 . Amiga AGA
 . Probably fast ram (I didn't try it on a plain A1200, but I don't think it
    works...)
 . xpkmaster.library and the sub-libs xpkMASH.library and xpkSQSH.library.
   Yes! I used them to save maximum space on disk. I'm just fed up with demos
   weighing more than 5 Mb. Anyway, Dazzle is still heavy: there are many
   images 640*512 in 256 colors, the main module more than 500 Kb unpacked,
   the first one about 130 Kb...  Big musics, big gfx mean poor hard drive!
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Note:

 The big executable is compressed with CrunchMania, so, be patient right after
 the loading, it may take a little moment...
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Other's people routines used:

 Chunky to Planar routine by Tchoom/Arkham
 Perfect Song replayer by Seg/Darkness & Department 22
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Installation:

 Quite simple: nothing to do, no stupid assign. Just be in the right directory
 when you load the executable.
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Well, I think that's all... Enjoy this production...

 PSB/Darkness
