                      Her skin, silken, ivory white.
                      Her hair, exotic, sculpted in umber.
                      Her lips, full, pink as the rose.
                      Her eyes, hypnotic, grey as the sky.

                      In the waking hours she eludes me,
                      But as dormancy spreads through my physical form
                      The depths of my mind are free.
                      And my locus cereleus captures her,
                      And locks her image away,
                      Until my dream is no longer my dream.
