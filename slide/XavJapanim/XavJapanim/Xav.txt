          Hi! Thanks for downloading this piece of my Japanim' Art.


To start: just click on 'Start_Demo'.

This slide has been successful tested on:
Amiga 600 2Mo chip
Amiga 1200 (with Apollo 1240/40Mhz and 32Mo Fast)

You can also install it on a floppy disk: format a blank disk, use the
command INSTALL on it (it will be bootable), and copy all the files of the
archive.

NOTE: all the pictures are in PAL mode.


I drew this pics some years ago. It's not a complete collection, just a
little part... I also drew gfx for games, and in other styles...
(Some pics are very old... You'll surely guess what I mean... ;-) )

If you want to see other pics from me, just visit my web site!

If you have some questions, if you want to write me, just do it! I'm a nice
guy, and I answer to every e-mails and normal mails... Don't hesitate!

Kind regards,
Xav.


Special thanks to:
Nihondreamers, Protagonists, Italian Bad Boys, Bad, Greg, and all the artists
that have started their career on the Amiga Scene with Japanimation Demos and
SlideShows.


This production is Freeware: you can copy it, spread it, but all (ALL) the
files must be always together.
