  ***************************************

   This is my first all assembler amiga demo, and after one year and
   five months (which included a 3 month break from programming) it is
   finally finished! :)

   As my first Amiga was an Amiga 600, I have designed it so that it
   will work (fingers crossed!) on any Amiga 600.

   Minimum specs:  68000 CPU
                   2MB RAM
                   ECS Chipset


   If you have any comments (good or bad) send them to me at my email
   address (below). Please put the subject as "Amiga Demo: ALL SQUARE",
   so that I can easily find it if it accidentally ends up in my spam
   folder.
