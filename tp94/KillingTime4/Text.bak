You reached the
END
of
Oxyrons first
release on
AMIGA
called
Killing Time

And as always
the nostalgic
Upscroller

Lets go for
some detailed
Information
and Credits
for this
product

---

Lets start
with the coding

Intro, endpart
and loadersystem
were developed
by
Dante of Oxyron

---

The rotzoom
coded by tts
runs on a
4096 color
copper screen
ofcoz in
one frame

I think its enough
about this part
becoz nowadays a
rotzoom is nothing
special on amiga

---

The second part of
this demo is
called The Maze
its using the same
usual 4096 color
coppermode
some special
features:

animations
sinus plots
shade plots
interference
feedback
rotzoom

by the way
coding by tts

---

The next part
is featuring
a texturemapped
city

I think there
is nothing
special about
this part
except of the
high resolution

Coding by Axis

---

After this city
tts shows you
some realtime
ifs fractals

just to kick
some legendary
mens asses

hi a.. dont
take this too
serious

---

Now the most
unimpressive part
of this demo

The linevectors
were coded by
tts
even though hes
not very proud
of them

by the way
this is the
first part he
ever coded on
amiga

---

Now lets go on
with the
gouraud
spacecut
coded by axis
Its nothing
special
and only coded
to fill up the
disk

To make them as
ugly as possible
we even dithered
them

---

Axis next part
in this demo
is a
texture mapper

It looks the
same like
the gouraud
but this is ok
because it is.
ehh... heard
somewhere b4?

---

the next
routine in this
demo is a
realtime
morph coded
by axis

at this moment
we have to
throw out some
BIG thanx to
Chaos of Sanity

without him we
wouldnt have
been able to
finish this
demo

by the way
chaos did the
first real
morph on amiga
and
I started to
code this
routine after
chaos give me
some infos about
morphing

but chaos
this part uses
a total different
principle than
yours, so please
dont care about
it

---

Last but not
least
tts presents his
texture tunnel

This effect uses
again the 4096
color copper mode

---

So thats it
about coding

Now lets go
on with the
graphics,
or let us call
it raytracing

All this stuff
was raytraced by
tts of oxyron

---

The third
important art
concerning demos
is music

The first
module was
composed by
starfox

...

---

After giving
you some infos
about this
demo i -axis-
want to throw
out some personal
greetings

lets start with
the c64 scene:


Hi Slammer!

I hope you like
this lame amiga
demo

vector camels?
Kick slammers

the amiga guys


This time only
greetings to the
Scala freax

chaos of sanity

---

So graham
enters the board

so finally our
first amiga
production is
about to be
released...

contribution

c64 demo which
hopefully will be

hiho
TTS is here
to tell you some
words about this
demo

in the last
hours before the
competition lots
of problem came
up and so this
version is very
LAME in my
opinion

The reason why
we released it
was, that we
wanted to tell
the scene about
our existance

well some fast
party amiga
greetings are
flying to

Sanity
Polka Brothers
Complex
Andromeda

huh, i am so
fucking tired
after about
fourty hours of
fixing the demo
whitout any
success

if you decrunch
file -huhu-
you can find a
harddisk
installing
programm

well thats it
for me
i am going to
have some hours
of relaxing now
before the amiga
demo competition
starts

over and lame...
