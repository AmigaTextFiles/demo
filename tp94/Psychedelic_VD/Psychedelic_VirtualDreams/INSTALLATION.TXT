************ INSTRUCTIONS TO INSTALL PSYCHEDELIC FOR HD USERS!!!***********

ok, here is what you have to do:

- add line to assign psychedelic: to your psychedelic dir in the user-startup
     example    assign psychedelic: demos:psy

- copy files from all 3 disks to your psychedelic: directory
     example    copy df0:#? demos:psy for each disk

- reset your computer!

- type psychedelic:psy to run the demo from CLI or make an icon for it!

     now you should have a running version of psychedelic on your HD!

 WHATS WRONG IF DEMO DOES NOT RUN?


 - not enough memory:
     if you run the demo from 2M chip machine, it needs around 1.8M free
     memory. try booting without startup sequence, and assign then
     psychedelic: and type psychedelic:psy

 - not AGA machine
     buy AGA machine. preferrable take some FAST type memory too.

 - not MC68020EC+ processor
     if you have AGA you'll have this too. if not, buy an AGA machine.

 - something else happens (like does not work on a4000 or something)
     mail doctor skull at
	skull@freenet.hut.fi and tell the problem. You should get a fix
	fairly soon. Or then not. Go to your friends computer and see
	it anyway :) (it's internet, ofcourse!)

That should quite do it! Any problems, mail me at the above address.
