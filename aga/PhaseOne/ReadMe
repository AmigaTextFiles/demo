			 Is proud to present
		
			      PHASE ONE
		     (we didn't choose the name)


Requirements: 68020 & 8 Mb

Tested on:
- A1200 Blizzard 030
- A1200 Blizzard 060
- A1200 BlizzardPPC 603+
- A4000 CyberStorm PPC

If you have problems running the demo on CyberStorm, try booting with
no startup-sequence. This demo run Setpatch automatically if not
runned before.
Created for 030/50.
Optimal configuration: Cyberstorm 060 or Blizzard 060. Please use
latest 060.library for best chip memory performance.
Please, keep in mind that general performance on BlizzardPPC 040 is
MUCH lower than blizzard 030 due to bad memory speed and forced
burstmode.
Phase One has a bug in the second part; reset is recommended after
running it for secure WB working!

For those interested, some comments on the code:

- The tunnel effect is a 320x200x256 1x1 raycasting running in one
frame on 030@50 (still incomplete). The lightning has a resolution of
1x8 (chip access sucks), but the result is still ok, don't you think
so?  Both the texturemapping and the lightning are in planar. It's a
real pity that a lot of coders work almost exclusively in chunky
forgetting planar modes :-(

- The cluster looks pathetic :-( Sorry. It was just to test a fast
rotation method with no muls. We failed to make it look nice...

- The doughnut... Reflex rulez! Mathematica rulez! C=64 lives forever!

- The first effect of the second part is a 2D hypersphere projection
(4D sphere) rotating in all 4 axis with a 'metaball' or 'metabob' in
each vert.  The main idea was doing an envmapped hypersphere, but the
thing got too complex (lots of polys and brain overflow when trying to
figure out the face connections... Not enough IQ, sorry). If you want
to try it we're willing to see one! :-) There's an hypercube example
in an old NGC intro (space pig, i believe) if you want to see more 4D
stuff...

- The rotozoom is 320x192x16 and runs in 1 frame on 030@50. Not
intended as a record, but shows how to do self-modifying code in a
safe way.

- Don't throw crappy effects to the trashcan... Just put a waste of
time meter in your demo and use it ;-) (this relates to the zooming
and rotating fragmented shit).

- The sand part is a real time effect. No anims on this demo :).
The sand function runs on vertical blanking to keep motion constant
on every CPU. A lolly-pop to the first one guessing what the fuck
this effect is.

- The 3d engine: Sucks.

- The hires+laced effect is 704x400 and uses a special c2p that skips
zeroes when dumping to chip. The chunky buffer is scrambled and the
whole code is a nightmare. Believe it or not, there're only 3
bitplanes (that's, bplcon0=$b205) active on the whole screen. Much more
complex than you could think at first sight.

That's all about the code.


Special thanks fly to:

Humphrey: You can finally rest now. The nightmare is over. And we
really hope your dreams are not full of textures! :-)

Alvin/TLOTB: Thanks for the cool 3d world!

Leunam: Forgive all the inconveniences...

Made/Bomb - Cyclone/Abyss - Danny/TBL: Really cool gfx! Thanx!

Dvize/LED: Sorry for changing the palette and the res... Hope you
don't mind!

Drareg & Skid/O3: You know why :-)

Alain Malek: Some horrible bugs were killed thanks to HRT-Mon! Thanks,
and keep making cool soft!

And to all those who keep the Amiga scene alive!

Personal greetings from Dr. Slump fly to:

MaM, Wasi & Mijac: It's been a long time since last mail...


No thanks to:

BGIII & Wintel for fooling the whole (not yet :-) world. Will Z80 take
over the world???

Aznar and his "España va bien!" for bringing back slavery to Spain.

TVE for beeing Aznar's puppet.

Spice Bitches (and their Spanish counterparts) for beeing sooooooooo
pathetic.

Radio Amistad for fooling simple-minded people with their religious
crap.

MetallicA for reloading the shit (Good Old Times (tm) rulez!)

Fresones Rebeldes for lowering Spain's average IQ.

Leticia Sabater for imposing a stupid vocabulary to new generations.



Phew! Enough.
