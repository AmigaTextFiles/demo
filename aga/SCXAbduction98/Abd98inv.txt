	Official Abduction'98 Invitation (v.1.0)
	----------------------------------------

	This is the first official announcement to invite you all to
	attend Abduction'98 and celebrate the beginning of hot summer!
	Dates are set, the place has been reserved and it all looks
	great, just read on to find out all the fine details!

	This is the first public version of this text file. You can
	identify updates from the version number on the title.


	What, Where and When?
	---------------------

	Abduction'98 is a scene party held in Oulun Urheilutalo in Oulu,
	Finland (yes, it's the same place as last year). The happening
	occupies the first weekend of June starting on Friday, 5th of
	June and ending on Sunday, 7th of June thus lasting for three
	sunny days. The detailed schedule is later in this text file.

	This annual happening is held for the fifth consecutive time, so
	it can be said that Abduction parties have became an important
	part of today's demoscene in Finland. We hope this will be a
	thing to last and thereby invite you all to attend this weekend
	of pure entertainment. Bring your PC, Amiga, C64, SGI/SUN/Cray
	workstation or VIC-20, the spirit of belonging together is
	truly more important than the hardware you are using.

	The party building is a comfortable sports center. It's main
	hall combined with the open space between the hall and the
	second floor cafeteria can easily hold 500 visitors and more.
	There are seats on both sides of the main hall where you can
	rest, meet your friends or get an unique view over the party
	hall. Or if you are more on the outdoor mood, we have these
	huge grass fields next to the building. A thing lot of people
	were happy about last year.

	We will arrange traditional demo and intro competitions for PC
	and Amiga groups to attend. Artistic competitions for skilled
	composers, pixel artists and 3D modellers are in schedule as
	well. These and the spectacular Wild! competition are open to
	everyone regardless of the platform the contributions were
	made on. There will be a powerful PA system set up and all the
	finalists will be shown using it and the *huge* big screen. For
	more information about the competitions read the rules later
	in this text file.

	Entrance fee is 120 FIM (~22 USD) for the whole weekend. Girls,
	foreigners and senior citizens get in for free! Foreigners:
	please bring your passport or some other id to prove your
	nationality.

	Abduction'98 is organized by Abduction Organizing ry which is
	a non-profit organization dedicated to work for the scene.
	None of us will get paid for what we are doing. By supporting
	Abduction'98 you're keeping the scene alive, not paying
	anyone's holiday trip to the Bahamas :)


	Party Facilities
	----------------

	- Great place with lot of room, electricity for everyone,
	  tables where to put your stuff, showers and quiet sleeping
	  hall in the ground floor

	- Superb PA system with loudspeakers all around the main hall,
	  not just in front of it

	- Big screen showing information services, competitions and
	  favourite demos on multiple platforms -- all around the
	  clock

	- Cafeteria / snack bar open 24 hours a day

	- Lovely outdoor recreation area next to the party place, ideal
	  for hanging around and meeting soul mates

	- Competitions on two major platforms -- PC and Amiga -- plus
	  many platform independent competitions

	- Diskette-based voting and realtime counting of votes on the
	  big screen

	- Party network and 2 Mbps connection to the Internet (bring
	  your own network cards)

	- Quake II tournament with prizes for the hardest killers
	  (yeah, bring those bloody network cards!)

	- Special competitions on Saturday afternoon

	- Perhaps even live music

	- Much much more


	Rules to Remember
	-----------------

	These rules are not to bother you but to ensure the happiness
	of other people too. Visitors breaking any of these rules will
	be warned or removed from the party place when needed. Finnish
	and international laws do apply in Oulu as well <grin>, so we
	can call the cops to pick you up :)

	1. Absolutely *no* alcohol, drugs, smoking, vandalism or
	software piracy inside the party building.

	2. You are not allowed to sell hardware, software, food or
	something else without getting a permission from the organizers.

	3. You are legally responsible for your actions and their
	consequences: you pay what you break.

	4. The organizers have the right to remove a person from the
	party place and not let him (or her) in again if this person
	has broken any of these rules, Finnish or international laws.

	5. The organizers of Abduction'98 have the right to add, modify
	or otherwise change these rules.

	6. You as a visitor acknowledge these rules and promise to
	have a fun filled weekend!


	Competitions
	------------

	Want to make money fast and legally? By contributing to one
	of the many competitions we are offering you get the chance
	to win! Prizes are mainly cash (paid after the party) but
	there might be some cool hardware prizes as well. All the
	profit from ticket sales will be used as prizes; thus the
	more visitors we have, the better the prizes will be.

	Every visitor will get a PC-formatted diskette with voting
	programs for both PC and Amiga. With these programs you can
	vote for the top five in each competition category. Returned
	votes are counted in real time on the big screen.

	In the PC Demo and PC 64 kB Intro competitions two different
	setups are available to choose from, namely DOS and Win95/98.
	If you are programming for the Windows, keep in mind that also
	the special DLLs must fit in the size limit. We strongly
	advise you to contact Ws/Nv in advance if you are planning to
	support Win32 in your production. Other operating systems
	(Linux?) might be supported if there are enough demand for
	them.

	There have been questions about additional main competitions,
	for example Commodore 64 Demo competition. We will add support
	for them if we get enough response from the scene.

	The maximum playing times listed below are *guidelines* only.
	Most probably we don't cut the modules at 3'00 sharp but 
	you should at least *try* to obey them.

	** General rules for all the competitions **

	- At least one of the authors has to be present at the party
	  place to take part in the competition.

	- An almighty jury will review all the entries and decide the
	  amount and the names of the finalists which will be shown on
	  the big screen.

	- Organizers reserve the right to disqualify entries because of
	  bad taste (f.i. racial or explicit sexual content).

	- Entries with copyrighted or illegal material will be
	  automatically disqualified.

	- All entries will be distributed immediately after the party.
	  They will be available at our ftp site and from other sources
	  as well.

	- Organizers reserve the right to make a low-cost CD-ROM and
	  put all or selected entries from Abduction'98 on it.

	- All the entries (except for the Wild! competition) must be
	  delivered on normal-size diskettes, either in PC or Amiga
	  format. These diskettes will *not* be returned.

	- By contributing your production, you are acknowledging these
	  rules.

	Deadlines on Friday are *final* but on Saturday you can
	bring updated versions to your work also after the deadline.
	Read the schedule for more information.
