Ephidrena gave you Substral- The demo, at tp98.

Demo requirements:
------------------
Who cares.. It worked on the partycomputer and also on my o3o and my friends
o6o. Requires 8meg of ram and a bit of patience at the start if you don't
have a o6o I think :D.


In depth Credits. :D
----------------------
Code:
- Most routines by Loaderror/Ephidrena
- Goraud shaded gun by Accede/Contraz
- Startup by Cyberstarr/Ephidrena
- Player code by Jarno Paananen
- C2P code by Scout/Tbl
- Squareroot calculator by Romeo/Donut Fetish.

Gfx
----------------------
- Substrallogo,textures,endscreen and Brightside picture by Cheetah/Ephidrena
- Cybereyetexture by Loaderror
- Eye-Picture original by Cheetah. Retouched and adapted for the effect by
  Loaderror.
- Star effect background texture by Loaderror/ephidrena
- Arcane, Chriz and Pinocchio photographs taken by Leia/Apathy. Spooky
modifications by Loaderror with antialiasing and retouching by Cheetah.
- Ephidrena anim and Subgunnar-anims by Stoney/Ephidrena.
- Credit-anims by Loaderror
- All 3d objects by Loaderror.

Music
----------------------
- Two tunes were made, the first which we didn't use because it didn't fit
the atmosphere we wanted was mainly composed by Frequent with some
additional modifications by Zixaq.
- The demo tune was tracked by Zixaq with some additional mixing at the end
of the tune by Frequent. Most samples by frequent or taken from
internet-sources. Some screaming by Stoney;D

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technicals:
----------
All effects in 1x1 320x200 256colours using Scouts c2p except for the
strange 3d tunnel and the wire-hand effect which were 1x2 320x128 and 1x1
320x256 respectively.

Most effects apart from the Eph-logo effect uses a shadetablesystem which
mimics 256 colours with 64 shades each in a dark-to-light sorted 256 colour
palette. This is what takes so long to calculate when the Substral-logo is
shown.

About the effects:
--------------------
Startanim:
- 2 colours 122 frames.
- Compressed with my own run-length-encoding system.
- Blurred with texture in the back sliding across the screen to bring
colour to the anim.

Starfield:
- 288 2x2 sized dots rotating in all 3 dimensions
- Blurred with texture in the back sliding across the screen to bring
colour to the effect.

Eye in starfield:
- Eye-picture crossfaded onto the screen using a somewhat uncorrect
cross-fader routine i wrote for the "norsktoppen 3" intro. It uses only
subtractions and additions and some comparing against the background. The
effect isn't all that convincing but it's a useful routine anyway.

Eye with goraud gun:
- around 150 faces goraudshaded and placed in the intensity layer of the
screen to give the transparent effect. Part of Accedes 3d world which is
still in development.
- chriz/apathy model crossfaded onto the screen using the same crappy
crossfader as above.
- the cybereye is a tablebased ball-routine done in realtime to make it Zoom
out of the eye.

Cybereye with ligth:
- Just two sets of tables. The ball-table, and one which looks into the
center of the ball and checks how bright the current pixel should be
according to the balltextures orientation.
- The ball-table uses word-offsets, but the lightcheck-table still uses
longword offsets because the effect was originally planned for 320x256 use.
I intend to change this in the future to make the effect somewhat faster on
030.

3D tunnel:
- This is just a load of unfinished bollocks. There's probably something
wrong in my rotation routine that makes the tunnel look the way it does.
Still it looks kind of cool anyway:D The gridsize is 16x16 and the routine
can still be optimised a lot. Perhaps in a later demo.

Eph-logo:
- Run-length-encoded logo with twin tables subtracted together in the background.

Credits:
- Animations:2 colors 300 frames.
- 60 3d dots in the back all blurred and coloured.

The Ball:
-Same formula as the cybereye, but now in all it's glory with shading and
zooming. Spent a lot of time making this effect run in realtime. You'll know
if you've seen my other demos:D Perhaps the last time you'll se this effect
coming from my code.
- Wireframevector: 310 doublethickness lines blurred to make it glow.
- Crossfaded transparent and spooky Pinocchio model. Who cares about naked
ladies on top of effects when we can use our scenefriends. :D

Brightside effect:
- Picture by Cheetah/eph. The winner of the Kindergarden party this
November.
- Wire-hand: 302 lines blurred etc....
- Crossfaded Arcane with real funny message...Although the only people
laughing were the people in the back of the module:( "Boozing is a form of
Substral travel" --> "Dreaming is a form of astral travel" . Get it :D
Substral, by the way, is a liquid that makes the vegetables grow faster. In
Ephidrena though, we like to think of it as the opposite of Astral.. While
Astral is all pretty, colourful and nice. Substral is hell, noise and
disturbed stuff. Yeahh!!

Sub-anim and background..
- Sub-anim: 323 frames in 2 colours. blurred etc..
- The background is just another table with shade and nice stuff like that.
- wire Nuclearsymbol: 102 blurred lines.

Zooming-stars.
- The starfield used as light for the ball. With a zoom routine put in for
good measure.
- 180 3d dots.
- Didn't look quite as planned although it was cool on the o6o.

End-screen:
Yeah. See you all at the next party.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The best thing about this demo though, is that it's technically inferior
when compared to say Thains demo, but it's the design and all the hours gone
into music and graphics that secured it a position among the top five..
cool. But perhaps next time I'll get into some heavy 3d-stuff too.

The gracious greets from Loaderror
