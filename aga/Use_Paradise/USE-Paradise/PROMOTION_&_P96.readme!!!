ABOUT P96 and Promotion for multi gfx-cards users: (VERY IMPORTANT!)

	Try too run the demo with CGX Emulation... If it doesn't work, try to
	use a screen-promotor... I have done this new version of Paradise
	specialy to be promoted. About promotion, VERY IMPORTANT: You have
	to promote to a 320*200*16 or 320*240*16 screen mode... DON'T USE
	a screen mode MORE than 240 height... AND, once you have selected
	your 320*200 or 320*240 screen, change the "height" gadget to 480.
	ALLWAYS! (don't use "default" height)...

	Promotion works PERFECTLY under CGX, The demo run fine in 320*240*16
	(with "height" gadget set to 480, don't forget!) on my BVision,
	promoted by "ModePro"...

	Maybe it can works under P96, but the colors may be false (mode used is
	RGB16)... TEST IT AND REPORT ME IF IT WORKS PLZ!!!
