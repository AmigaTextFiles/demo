- How to run the demo on '040/'060 based systems...

	1. Boot without startup-sequence
	2. CPU CACHE
	3. Thug_Life.040

- Do NOT run Setpatch! If you do so you will enable CopyBack mode -> demo
will crash.

- Some comments for coders...

	The guys play around happily with the CACR register (the demo runs
in supervisor mode) and therefore it doesn't work on '040, so I just
replaced those CACR accesses by a CPUSHA BC and it magically works. Easy
eh? And of course once you do so the demo won't run again on '030.


Yours sincerelly,
