Before  you  run  the  demo,  certain  steps  have  to be taken in order of
attaining maximum success.          ||
                                    ||
                                    ||
      1.) Depack the TheGate.lha file to a directory of your harddrive.
                                    ||
       e.g.: "Lha -e TheGate.lha Hd0:TheGate/"
                                    ||
      2.) Start the demo by either 'TheGate.exe' or 'TheGate.exe low'. The
       latter  argument  will  affect  the  demo  to  run  in  a  lower
       resolution  ( 2*1 )  so users of -slower- Amigas shall have more
       enjoyment with this tool.    ||
                                    ||
                                    ||
Please  follow  these steps closely and then sit back, relax, enjoy and let
your mind getting expanded.  Let it being opened like...

17.6.96 Aminet Version Release.

-fixed some bugs.
-changed some textures.

Some notes:

This version has graffiti-support as an addition. Start the demo by  typing
'TheGate.exe  graffiti'  or  'TheGate.exe  graffiti  low'  to  enable  this
feature.  The  graffiti-support  is  tested  on  AGA-Amigas.  Probably  the
ECS-code will work fine, too.

The Aminet-version was planned to be released earlier, but there were still
some  bugs  left.  But  we  have to intention to waste more time by finding
them. ;) Probably the demo will work fine on your computer.
