			       " THE EXORCIST "




                       1996. april 12-14 Budapest/Hungary





	  In the spring of 1996 we'll organize again the SCEneST, which will
	be much-much better and bigger than the last year event
				more prizes
				 better organizing
				  better atmosphere
				   more attenders....

	  Last year, we successfully organized the biggest hungarian scene
	party: 600 computer freak came together. We hope, in 1996 we'll
	break this record and after a few years the SCEneST will become a
	real world-sized scene party.

	  There are a few big parties around the world, even in the nordic
	countries. The number of the visitors in the biggest one (ASM'95)
	was 4200. In Hungary, 1000 would be a really big number, it's up
	to you! We got very positive echoes about the sceNEst#1, everyone
	wanted the sequel: "there has to be at least one good party in
	every year..." they said. The partyplace and the compo machines
	was also popular, and we kept our word: we awarded the productions
	with 300.000.- Ft. The organizing wasn't perfect (perfection is
	unreachable), but we knew that the "first can't be the best". We've
	learned from our own mistakes.

	  The things that make the party really better are the productions
	of the compos. The quality and the number of these doesn't depend
	on the organizers, the only one "what" can increase'em is the scene
	itself. Some teams work for the money, some just wanna keep their
	fame, or just live for the creativity. We give the prizes, but YOU
	have to make the prods, so:
		"We ask every PC/AMIGA/C64 team to make demos/intros
				to the SCEneST '96!"

	  We are thankful for your recommendations, ideas. Don't forget:
	THE PARTY IS FOR YOU!

	  We'd like to invite every computer freak to the SCEneST#2!

	  1996 April 12-13-14, friday 4PM to sunday 10AM, NONSTOP. Because

	will end til dawn!)
