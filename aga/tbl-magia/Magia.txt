                a demo by The Black Lotus


What?

     A 680x0 demo. Requires 68020, FPU and 32MB fastram, but don't bother
   watching this on anything less than a 68060. Really.


Where?

     Released at Breakpoint 2003, which was held in Bingen, Germany
   during  april 18-21 2003.


   Louie, Tudor, Destop/CNCD, Masta	- graphics

   Steffo/Cryonics, Blaizer/TSL		- music


Warning!

      Our immortal adversary, Gusten, is lurking somewhere within the depths
    of this executable file. Waiting for the right opportunity, it will strike
    without warning and corrupt some helpless bits in your memory. We will deal
    with him any year now. Really.

    And reboot after watching.
