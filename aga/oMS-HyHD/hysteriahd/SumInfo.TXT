Here is what you are going to need to watch this old demo from HardDisk:

- An Amiga(?)
- ½Mb Chip
- 1.5Mb Fast
- Harddrive

I think everyone should have these nowadays!


Use the install-script provided to copy your disks to HardDisk!


ATTENTION!: If your Amiga has an PCMCIA-slot, DISABLE IT!!!!!    B->
- (In my A1200/030/50 the techno-part screwed up if CC0: was present!)


                                   Again this one is a » o'Moses Release «
