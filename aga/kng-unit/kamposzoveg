the story of this dentro.

All began in August '99, we wanted to release this as a 64k intro at
some local party.Unfortunately almost all the sources went lost.The 
music originally supposed to be packed with mp3 alike compressor 
(only the samples ofkoz).After some heavy salving we could manage to 
get the sources back, except for the compressor thing.Since we have
very little time recently, we did a downsampled version of the original
module.We decided to release this at Mekka-Sympo in the introcompo, but
due the lack of time we missed the deadline somehow.After some 
discussion we decided to release it as a dentro, including the
"better quality" version of the music.I hope you'll enjoy it! 

We're really sorry for Cheetah, he needed to wait almost a year
to see his work.But finally here it is for you. :) 

Play it loud!
