AMAZED HD-INSTALL
=================

To install AMAZED to your harddrive, copy all files from the three disks to
the same directory on your harddrive, and type 'Amazed.EXE' to run!


RELEASE
=======

Due to an enourmous time-pressure, this version is somewhat crippled and
bugged - a new version, including an extra animation and more, will be
out shortly!
