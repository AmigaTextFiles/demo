Smack/IFT writing:

we loved all these comments by people on tv about multimedia and these
things. the anim player is intended for playing anims in my own special
format :-) directly from hd or cd. this version is still very buggy so
you are using it completely at your own risk (ofcourse). you should not
try to promote the players screen, you would see only garbage. i know
this tiny anim is not a good example for showing the players features
but how should people spread a 10 MB anim?

i want to thank Andreas Maschke for all his work so far, hopefully we
will get serious about the cd project some time.


this ridiculous production (?) is ofcourse meant in an ironic way...
real multimedia starts at anim sizes over 100 MB! ;-)

greetings to mlno (sitting beside me) and to the lazy lamer eksec.


MLNO:

ja...kleine deutsche unterbrechung..(ofcotz in kleinen buchstaben...)

jede woche...(oh weia!)
