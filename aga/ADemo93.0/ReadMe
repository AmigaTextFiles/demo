   Amiga - Demo 93

This is a 5-disk dealer demo for the Amiga 1200 and 4000.
It especially features the AGA chips. Therefore:

**********************************************************************
*                                                                    *
* This demo ONLY runs on AGA Amigas, like A1200 and A4000.           *
* The Amiga MUST have a harddisk.                                    *
* On this harddisk, the complete OS 3.0 MUST be installed.           *
* You MUST use a multiscan monitor, e.g. Commodore 1950, 1960, 1942, *
* else the demo would suffer from extreme flicker (interlace!).      *
*                                                                    *
**********************************************************************

This demo is also easily adaptable to your individual needs and
languages.

All control scripts and texts are found in ADemo93.1:work/s
on the first disk.
This first disk also contains a set of monitor files and
preferences settings files, as well as a certain version of c:IPrefs.
These files will overwrite the files on the HD, but their previous
versions will be saved to an extra directory before, so nothing gets lost.
Further this first disk contains an anim and a pic directory (under
ADemo93.1:work) with some files.
This first disk is formatted with OFS.
All the other disks are formatted with FFS to gain more capacity, and
they only carry pic files, without any subdirectories.

The whole demo consists of a normal AmigaDOS script file named Demoscript.
Following programs are used and provided:
Display   AGA-capable image viewer by Carolyn Scheppner
dis2      A wrapper around Display to bring up a new picture and
          when this is ready, delete the previously displayed one(s),
          by Dr. Peter Kittel.
textsc    A program that takes a plain text file as argument and
          displays this text at the bottom of the screen character
          for character in an upwards scrolling screen, by Dr. Peter Kittel.
          An at sign (@) in the text file is considered as an end mark.
          TABs are recognized, use e.g. MicroEmacs to create text
          files with TABs.
          A fixed, rather big font is used, so you have to check that
          the text is not too wide.
VT (ViewTek)  A PD image and animation viewer, used here for the anims,
          by Thomas Krehbiel.


How to make your own demo

1. Select among the current pic files those that you want to keep,
   delete the rest.
2. Delete accompanying text files in ADemo93.1:work/s. Delete the
   lines in ADemo93.1:work/s/Demoscript that deal with these files.
3. Select new images, put them on some of the disks, put appropriate
   text files in ADemo93.1:work/s, update the file Demoscript.
   Anims would belong into ADemo93.1:work/anim. If they are too big,
   you would have to do some major rearrangement of the install script
   and the distribution of the files to the various disks.
4. If necessary, translate text files in ADemo93.1:work/s. Translate
   all files, including the Install.2 and Demo01 scripts. Set the
   s protection bit for Demo01 and copy this to ADemo93.1:sys/s,
   with the set s bit (copy ... clone).
5. In ADemo93.1:work/pic, you find pic files for the necessary credits.
   One, Credits, is the german version, the other, CLogo, is the same
   background that you should use to create a similar credits screen
   in your language.
6. There are two script files installed in the s: directory, demo01
   and demostart. The first one lets you switch on an off the automatic
   start of the demo in user-startup, the latter one allows you to
   start the demo from a Shell. You may choose to add icons to these
   scripts (using IconX) and perhaps place them somewhere where they
   are easily accessible. But there are also counter arguments: When
   this demo runs unattended in a shop, you wouldn't want to make it
   too easy for a kid to access such controls and perhaps manipulate
   or delete the demo or other stuff on the computer...


Special remarks for IFF ILBM files

Some IFF files cause a jumpy display. When they are displayed alone,
the screen is set to a certain width. As soon as the upscrolling
screen of textsc appears, the screen switches to some other display
mode with differing width. This produces an ugly jump of the display
and can't get solved by ModePromotion.
There are several things to be considered to calm this down:
- We must have a certain set of Monitor files, preferences settings,
  and c:IPrefs version. This is covered by the first install disk
  (ADemo93.1:), the files on it and the Install.2 script.
- The IFF file must not have set a certain bit in its CAMG chunk.
  ATTENTION: If you are not familiar with a hex editor and the
  IFF storage rules, DO NOT do this yourself! Find someone in the know.
  First step: Load the image in DPaint(AGA), and save it again.
  This serves to set other bits straight.
  Second step: Invoke a tool like NewZap3.0 to hex-edit the file.
  (Or use the provided ARexx program CAMG.rexx. It does this for you.)
  Find the CAMG chunk. Here displayed like with   type xxx hex:

  0090: 43414D47 00000004 00039024 424F4459    CAMG.......$BODY
       >    name      len     ^   <
  00B0: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00004341    ..............CA
                                      >
  00C0: 4D470000 00040002 9000424F 44590000    MG........BODY..
        name      len     ^   <
  The important bit is 0x1000 of the lower significant word of the
  CAMG chunk. Typically, after saving such a file from DPaint, you
  find a 9xxx entry here. Change this in the hex editor to 8xxx:

  0090: 43414D47 00000004 00038024 424F4459    CAMG.......$BODY
       >    name      len     ^   <
  00B0: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00004341    ..............CA
                                      >
  00C0: 4D470000 00040002 8000424F 44590000    MG........BODY..
        name      len     ^   <


Finally, have fun and give the world some nice impression of the
Amiga's capabilities. If you have nice stuff, feel free to send
it to me. It should be easily integratable in such a sort of
DOS script driven demo.
