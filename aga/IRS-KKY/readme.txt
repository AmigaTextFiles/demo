                              PRESENTS THE DEMO

                                  KILKENNY
 
                                  IN 1997


Install instructions:

Quite simple stuff actually. Just make a dir somewhere on your
HD and copy all of the files there. The run the file called
Kilkenny.... The intro part is crunched, and will only work
with more than 4mb fastram. If you have only 4mb fastram,
uncrunch the file and it will work nicely.
