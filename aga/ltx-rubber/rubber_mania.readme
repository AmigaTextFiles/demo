This Demo (my only demo) was released at Compusphere 96

it was made at the party in a big rush... so i think it's ok for
that short time of work...

Code:    Olle (Omen)
Graphix: Lunix / Latex , Alien head by Olle (as usual)
Musix:   Lunix / Latex

Size:    870Kb

this demo should work to be running in workbench, not as icon, but in dos..
Vbl-interrupt should work..

I think we got a low position at the compo... :)
anyway it was fun making it....

Regards, Olle
