»» Alfa Omega HD-Loader made by Zer0-X! ««

Here's what you are going to need to view this veccy demo from HardDisk:

- Any Amiga(!)
- ½Mb Chip
- 1½Mb Fast
- Harddrive

I think everyone should have these nowadays!


Use the install-script provided to copy your disk to HardDisk!

ATTN!: Think it runs a bit too fast?
