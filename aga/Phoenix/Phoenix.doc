Installing:- Please note now that this demo is AGA only.
To install the program and the data files (keeping the data files and
their subdirectory) into a directory or a disk and then assign that
directory or drive to `Aggresion:':i.e.

Assign Aggresion: <drive:(directory)>

Run from CLI by running the program "Phoenix".

Usage:- The camera position in the walk-around is controlled by the
joystick in the following manner. To move forward and backwards push
the joystick up and down respectively. To rotate from left to right
push the joystick left and right respectively. To move the camera
position on the vertical up and down press the fire button and
at the sametime push and up and down on the joystick respectively.
To control the size of the screen use the function keys f1-f7. The
screen sizes and modes and listed as follows:-
f1 - Lores copperlist.
f2 - Hires copperlist.
f3 - 128*72*8 screenmode.
f4 - 160*90*8 screenmode.
f5 - 192*108*8 screenmode.
f6 - 256*144*8 screenmode.
f7 - 320*180*8 screenmode.
To exit the program press the left mouse button.

History:- Well where shall I start. The ideas for this program started out
in September 1994. I had just finished learning 68020 and I wanted to 
write a graphics engine for demos and games. I started of by looking
at the code for tmapdemo and then for Wolf_3D but I couldn't understand
the processes that they were using in their code. So I developed a
realtime scale routine of my own. But this did not have the speed
that I needed. I left the routine on the backwash until Feburary this
year when I found the out how to use the chunky2planar rountines. So
using these I developed a realtime scale routine based on the one I
had done in September. The next step was to develop a texture map routine
for doing walls which could handle a rectangular polygon at any angle and at
any distance. The development of the Texture Map Engine took about 2-3
weeks which after that I started work on Aggresion (Transwarp II) demo for
the Posse (still under development). After completing the major sections of
the code for the Aggresion I developed the code from the demo and produced
this program in about a week. I then added the worked on the copperlist
viewing routines (2 days ago) and then I added the options of the function
keys, music player, animation brushs.
   So that is more or less a little story of the development of this
program. The reason for the assignment to Aggresion: drive is the
programs source code was storied in my Aggresion directory. As for the
name Phoenix that is a different matter. After doing the realtime scaling
routine using the chunky2planar routine I worked a program to do a
realtime walkaround. But this program failed due to the amount of mistakes
and bugs and found in the program. I was trying to run before I could walk.
So I took from what I had learned about that program and developed it into
the Texture Map Engine and also developed this program which is the result.
The name Phoenix is that this is program that arose from the ashes of
the program that had failed. A bit poetic I know.

Future:- I am starting work on a new engine which is totally different.
This time I am using full raycasting, matrix transformation, Z-buffer
alogthrims, BSP- tree structures for polygon storage, new and improved
texture map routines, Cyrus-Beck polygon clipping alogrthims and so on.
But I have nearly finished all the research and theory into it. This is
going to be used in a commercial game that we The Posse are working on 
called "Rise of the Dawn.".
