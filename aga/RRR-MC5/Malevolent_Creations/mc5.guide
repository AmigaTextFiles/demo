                   The Trial

I sat behind the rostrum and watched the audience and the jury discuss
the case. I had been brought to court since someone who worked for the
local newspaper had reported me being punished.

The newspaper worker had paid a lot of money to his employer for the work
he made when writing the story, so he thought it was worth the effort and
was true. The punishment he said I had suffered was imprisonment for five
years.

I personally could not remember whether I was punished or not, so I went
to court. I took my seat at the rostrum, and watched the judge sit down on
the little chair below me. Anxiously I declared the trial opened.

The judge introduced me to the two attorneys. On my left I saw the
prosecuting attorney, whose task was to assure everyone that I was not
punished. On my right I saw the defence attorney, whose task was to
assure everyone that I was punished.

I noticed my friend was sitting in the audience. "Please hurry", he said,
"I have parked my car outside and have accidentally left it running,
and I cannot afford that much exhaust fumes turned into useless petrol."
I assured him my trial would be short. If anyone would try to speak longly,
I would order him/her to stop.

"Let's hear the prosecuting attorney first", I said. So the attorney began.
He said that I could not have been punished, since five years ago (when my
last trial had taken place) the judge and mayor had better things to do,
like counting the votes of the last mayor election. The attorney even
reminded me of the results of the election. Five percent had voted against
the current mayor.

Thirteen percent had voted against his opponent. Eighty-two percent had
not voted, since they were too old to be allowed to.

"Now let's hear the defence attorney", I said. The attorney began.
He said he quite clearly remembered me being punished, and as evidence
he showed the court some photographs of me being punished. And indeed,
the year number on the photographs' date was five years larger than this
year's number, thus indicating that it had been five years ago.

"Sustainment!" shouted the judge suddenly. "Objected", I said,
"It's quite obvious that I wasn't punished, contrary to the previous
speaker's point of view."

"Now then, ladies and gentlemen of the audience, it's your task to
determine whether I was punished or not", I said. It was a good audience,
this time. The audience consisted of randomly-chosen completely voluntary
people, who had just come to decide the judgement of this trial. The jury,
on the other hand, paid huge amounts of money to their employers for
sitting in  their benches and just watching the trial.

After a while, the audience reached a decision. They said that I was not
punished, and the newspaper article had been false. I was thus judged
to commit a crime in two months' time. The judge decided that the crime
I would have to commit was a simple robbery on a fake jewellery store
whose owner had been subjected to a scandal news report for selling real
jewels.

"Excuse me", I said. "I have the right to a lawyer." So a lawyer appeared,
after which I telephoned for one. The operator said: "Yes, hang on a
moment... yes, we'll be sending you a lawyer about two minutes ago."
As was the tradition with lawyers, I (the client) had sorted out all the
legal stuff, and then I imposed my judgement on the lawyer, who thus had
to commit the crime.

Leaving the lawyer to his own devices, I left the courtroom and walked
to my home.
