@Node INTRODUCTION "Visage.guide/Introduction"

	@{u}@{b}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}

<Sigh> Yet another picture viewer. :)

Oh well, what can I say? There were no picture viewer available that suited
all my needs. They were lacking such trivial things as looking for
"external" break signals, and more important things such as good monitor
support.

But Visage is different. It has many features; some are not available in
any other picture viewer for the Amiga (as far as I know). Since some of
these features rely on things introduced in OS 3.0, this program requires
OS 3.0. There are several viewers that work on OS 2.0, so it is not a major
problem, IMHO.

The goal was a rather fast viewer, with many features. Picture quality was
not the most important thing (this mainly applies to the HAM and color
rendering).

@Node FEATURES "Visage.guide/Features"

	@{u}@{b}Features@{ub}@{uu}

Displays IFF ILBM, GIF, JPEG (using the @{"Tower JPEG Codec Class" Link JPEG}) and
datatype pictures.

The internal viewers (IFF ILBM and GIF) use asynchronous IO for high
performance. The picture decompressors are written in optimized assembler
for speed.

Full AA, ECS and RTG (I hope! ;) support.

Supports the IFF ILBM chunks CLUT (Color LookUp Table; only RGB), PCHG
(Palette CHanGe) and SHAM (Sliced HAM).

Displays "deep" pictures in all formats (including datatypes, if needed) on
ECS Amigas, rendered in HAM, "normal" color (graphics card recommended) or
grayscale.

IFF ILBM pictures can be Xpk compressed (asynchronous IO is not possible
for these pictures at the moment).

Fast HAM rendering of pictures, using code written by Rafael D'Halleweyn.

Can @{"scale" Link SCALE} any @{"rendered" Link RENDERED} picture to fit the screen.

Extensive monitor support. Uses a BestModeID()-like function to find a
suitable mode (if needed or requested).

Any native Amiga screen @{"mode" Link MODE} can be specified with @{"text" Link MODENAMES}! No numbers needed.
But you can use numbers, if you wish. Or a requester.

Simple promotion of pictures to any installed @{"monitor" Link MONITOR}. No hardcoded command
line options for this. Even a requester can be used.

Several slideshow options, including a @{"random" Link RANDOM} and a @{"sort" Link SORT} mode, making
Visage ideal for use with screen blankers as an external module.

Background loading of the next picture while viewing the current, if there
is enough memory (this can be disabled).

When using background loading, the new pictures do not open in front of all
other screens (unless told to). The two screens are "attached" to each
other.

Can @{"fade" Link FADE} pictures (but not HAM, SHAM or PCHG pictures).

Default options can be placed in an @{"environment variable" Link VISAGEOPTS}.

Invisible screen arranging gadgets.

Can execute a @{"command" Link COMMAND} for a picture.

Can show @{"information" Link INFO} about the pictures, @{"test" Link TEST} them or @{"time" Link TIME} them.

@{"Horizontal" Link CENTER} @{i}and @{ui}@{"vertical" Link VCENTER} screen centering.

Can be made resident.

System friendly color @{"cycling" Link CYCLE} (no interrupt).

Several other small features not mentioned here. :)

It is freeware! No need to pay anything (but that does not mean @{"I" Link AUTHOR} would
not appreciate a donation of any kind! :).

@Node REQUIREMENTS "Visage.guide/Requirements"

	@{u}@{b}Requirements@{ub}@{uu}

Visage should work on any Amiga that has OS 3.0 or higher. 512 KB of memory
is enough for operation, but more memory is indeed recommended (especially
if you want to view large and/or JPEG pictures). There are no required
disk-based libraries, although Visage will be limited if some are not
available (the GIF reader is the only one that does not need any disk-based
libraries).

I decided to let Visage require OS 3.0, since I otherwise would need to
rewrite several new functions in OS 3.0, or write code to work around bugs.
One feature cannot be implemented at all using OS 2.0. Despite all this, I
might make Visage support OS 2.0 in the future (if @{"I" Link AUTHOR} get requests for it.
Have not got any yet... ;).

	@{u}@{b}Required libraries@{ub}@{uu}

The following disk-based libraries are not necessary for Visage to operate,
but certain things will not work if they are not available:

	@{b}iffparse.library@{ub} version 39 or higher
	For the IFF ILBM reader.

	@{b}tower.library@{ub} version 1 or higher
	For the JFIF/JPEG reader. To work properly, the files @{i}codec.class,@{ui}
	@{i}picture.codec @{ui}and @{i}jpeg.codec @{ui}are needed as well, i.e.,
	@{"the JPEG codec" Link JPEG}. Included with Visage.

	@{b}datatypes.library@{ub} version 39 or higher
	For the datatypes reader. To work properly, suitable datatypes are
	needed as well. Some datatypes are included with the system;
	several exist as different kinds of freely distributable software.

	@{b}asl.library@{ub} version 38 or higher
	For the file, screen mode and monitor (!) requesters. If not
	available, you will get a warning if you try to use these
	requesters.

	@{b}xpkmaster.library@{ub}
	To view Xpk compressed or encrypted IFF ILBM pictures. For it to
	work properly, suitable sub-libraries are needed as well. Xpk can be
	found on Aminet and BBS:es.

	@{b}reqtools.library@{ub} version 38 or higher
	For the password requester that appears if an Xpk-encrypted picture
	is encountered, but no password was specified. ReqTools can be
	found on Aminet and BBS:es.

@Node ARGUMENTS "Visage.guide/Arguments"

	@{u}@{b}Arguments@{ub}@{uu}

Visage can be started from a Shell or the Workbench. For Shell users it
should be noted that Visage is pure, and may be made resident.

In the case of Workbench start, the tooltypes may be specified in either
the program icon, the picture icon(s), or any other icon (preferably
without an associated file). All tooltypes are collected (tooltypes found
later on overrides earlier ones) and parsed before viewing the pictures.

@{"VisageOpts" Link VISAGEOPTS} can be used to specify new defaults.

For both Workbench and Shell usage, the following arguments/tooltypes can
be specified:

@Node VISAGEOPTS "Visage.guide/Arguments/VisageOpts"
@Toc ARGUMENTS

	@{u}@{b}VisageOpts@{ub}@{uu}

New default values may be specified by entering them in the VisageOpts
configuration file or environment variable. The search order is as follows:

If the environment variable ConfigPath¹ exist, then try to read the file
VisageOpts in the drawer specified by ConfigPath. If the environment
variable or the file does not exist, then read the environment variable
VisageOpts, if present.

Put all options on any number of lines, similar to if Visage was started
from the Shell. Comments start with a `#' or `;' at the start of the line,
and they end at the end of that same line.

To disable the reading of VisageOpts (e.g. in a script), use the NOENV
switch. This disables both the environment variable and the configuration
file.

If a switch is specified in VisageOpts, then by specifying it again on the
command line you will turn off that switch. Thus, if CENTER is found in
VisageOpts, and CENTER is specified on the command line (or in the
tooltypes), no centering will occur.

Text or numeric arguments specified on the command line will simply
override any arguments specified in VisageOpts.

Two arguments in VisageOpts will always be ignored: FILES and NOENV. You
will not get a warning or anything if they are specified; they are silently
ignored. This has the side-effect that unknown options are ignored (they
are "swallowed" by the FILES argument).

	@{" NOENV  " Link NOENV}


@{b}-- Footnotes --@{ub}

¹ If you specify `ProgDir:' here (to get the same drawer as where the
program resides), please remember that you should not make the program
resident in that case. If you do, you will get `Please insert volume
ProgDir:' requesters, which can be annoying.

The name of the ConfigPath variable was deliberately chosen to be general.
The hope is that other programs also will use this, at least as a part of
their configuration file search path.

@EndNode


@Node FILES "Visage.guide/Arguments/FILES"
@Toc ARGUMENTS

	@{u}@{b}FILES@{ub}@{uu}

Here you specify the files you wish to view. You may enter any number of
files and drawers here, using patterns if you like.

If you enter the name of a drawer, a file requester will open, located in
that drawer (unless ALL has been specified). If you in this requester
specify the name of a file that does not exist, then Visage will treat is
as a pattern, unless the NOFILECHECK option have been specified. If no file
is specified (and the requester is not cancelled), then Visage will display
all pictures in the drawer in question (any pattern will be used).

You may even use this argument as a tooltype in an icon. So, if you would
like to get a slideshow over some pictures in a drawer, use the following
tooltypes (in an icon without its corresponding file). The default tool
should be set to Visage:

	FILES=Pics:Nature
	ALL
	DELAY=60

or something similar. A double-click on that icon will start the slideshow.

@Node BORDERBLANK "Visage.guide/Arguments/BORDERBLANK"
@Toc ARGUMENTS

	@{u}@{b}BORDERBLANK@{ub}@{uu}  Synonym: BB

Here you can specify if Visage should (try to) blank the borders of the
displayed picture or not. The following arguments are available:

	@{b}ON@{ub}
	Turn on border blanking.

	@{b}OFF@{ub}
	Turn off border blanking.

	@{b}DEFAULT@{ub}
	Use the system default.

If an invalid blanking mode is specified, you will be told about it, and
the default (DEFAULT) will be used.

@{i}Notes:@{ui}	This affects the systems border blanking flag only. Thus, it might
	not work on graphics cards (I do not know if any graphics card
	support this flag).

	Setting the argument to OFF does not seem to work (if the system
	global border blanking flag is activated). At least that is the
	case on my system.

	The vertical centering does not look that good if border blanking
	is on.

	@{" VCENTER " Link VCENTER}

@EndNode


@Node COMMAND "Visage.guide/Arguments/COMMAND"
@Toc ARGUMENTS

	@{u}@{b}COMMAND@{ub}@{uu}  Synonym: CMD

Here you can specify a command that can be executed for each viewed
picture. To execute the command, press the `e'-key when the picture in
question is displayed. When in TEST mode, the command will be executed when
a picture with an error is found.

The command will be executed as if it had been started in the same drawer
as the picture. The name will always be quoted (e.g. to make it easy to
parse from Rexx). The command is run asynchronously, so you may continue to
the next picture when you like. If the command could not be run for some
reason, the screen will flash (if no command is specified, then this will
not happen).

By default the name of the picture will be added to the end of the command.
If the string `[]' is specified in the command, then the name will replace
the @{i}first @{ui}occurence of this string. This is similar to how the Alias
command works (see your AmigaDOS manual for more information about Alias).

This argument makes it easy to mark pictures for deletion or something
similar. In that case, a command like:

	FileNote [] "Delete this picture"

can be useful. Then simply press `e' for the pictures you do not want to
keep, and do the actual deletings from a shell or a directory utility.
Using the above command rather than `Delete' has the benefit that it is
easy to undo, in case you press the key by mistake.

The command `Move [] TO Pics:' can cause problem in case several pictures
with the same name (but in different drawers) are processed. An ARexx
script can be used to work around this problem, if needed. Note that a
`Move' command is not included with the OS.

@{u}Note@{uu}:	To specify the above example from a shell, you must enter it like
	this:

		COMMAND="FileNote [] *"Delete this picture*""

	(Note the escaped quotation characters.) If you enter it as a
	tooltype, just enter it as the first example shows.

@Node DITHER "Visage.guide/Arguments/DITHER"
@Toc ARGUMENTS

	@{u}@{b}DITHER@{ub}@{uu}

Here you can specify which kind of dithering that should be used, when
rendering pictures to COLOR or GRAY modes. In the latter case, dither is
only used when the screen displays less than 256 colors.

Currently, the following dither types are available:

	@{b}NONE@{ub}
	No dithering. This is the fastest, but also gives the lowest
	quality. It is not recommended if COLOR rendering is used.

	@{b}ORDERED@{ub}, @{b}ORD@{ub}
	Ordered dithering. A fast dither, but the quality is not the best.
	Quite sufficient for grayscale images though. This is the default.

	@{b}FS@{ub}
	Floyd-Steinberg dithering. Gives very good quality, but is slower
	than ORDERED (about 30% in the COLOR render case).

If an invalid dither type is specified, you will be told about it, and the
default (ORDERED) will be used.

@EndNode


@Node MODE "Visage.guide/Arguments/MODE"
@Toc ARGUMENTS

	@{u}@{b}MODE@{ub}@{uu}

Here you can specify which screen mode the pictures should be displayed
with. There are several ways to specify the mode:

	Via a screen mode requester. Simply enter "REQUEST" or "?" after the
	MODE keyword. This requires asl.library to be available.

	A decimal or hexadecimal number, "describing" the mode. If the
	number starts with `$' or `0x' it is assumed to be hex. The program
	GetModeID can be used to find out the (decimal) number for a
	certain mode.

	A text string (anything that is not covered by the above). Either a
	name from the display database, or an algorithmic name.

Specifying a (valid) mode here will override the MONITOR and WBMONITOR
arguments.

If the specified mode is not capable of displaying the picture for some
reason, Visage will try to find a replacement mode that is as similar as
possible. Thus, you usually do not need to worry about things such as HAM
and EHB. Visage should handle that automatically.

@{u}Note@{uu}:	Visage also understands the "normal" mode names (as shown by the
	ScreenMode preferences program). However, the normal mode name will
	only be considered if the mode name didn't match an algorithmic
	name. Thus, e.g. "DblPAL:High Res" will use the algorithmic name,
	while "Multiscan:Productivity" will use the normal mode name.
	The NORMALNAMES switch can be used to change this behaviour (Visage
	will then check the display database name first).

@Node MONITOR "Visage.guide/Arguments/MONITOR"
@Toc ARGUMENTS

	@{u}@{b}MONITOR@{ub}@{uu}

With this parameter you can easily promote the pictures to display to any
available monitor, providing it is capable of displaying the picture.
Simply specify the name of the monitor, or a pattern for the monitor(s),
and Visage will look through the display database for any matches If found,
the picture will be promoted to use one of the specified monitors, if
possible. If several monitors matched the pattern, the BestModeID()
function will select the monitor it considers to be the best one to display
the picture.

You can also specify the special name "REQUEST" or "?", to get a requester
containing the available monitors (except for the so called default
monitor). Note that the properties window will not contain useful
information, except for the frequencies. You can currently not select more
than one monitor in this requester.

	@{b}TEXT@{ub}
	Text overscan, as set by preferences. Display limits visible.

	@{b}GRAPHICS@{ub}, @{b}STANDARD@{ub}
	Graphics (or standard) overscan, as set by preferences. Display

	Maximal overscan. The largest overscan that the system
	"comfortably" can display.

	@{b}VIDEO@{ub}

Here you can specify the size of the IO buffers (in kilobytes) used by the
asynchronous IO code (used by the IFF ILBM and GIF readers). Two buffers of
roughly half the size specified will be allocated, if possible. Normally
this value should not need changes, but you might get somewhat better
performance with other values here (depending on the media).

Default is 16 KB. Values below 4 KB are rounded to 4 KB, but the code will
(usually) try with smaller buffers, if there is not enough memory
available.

@{u}Note@{uu}:	This buffer size should not be larger that roughly half the average

Default value depends on the starting program (usually it is 0).

This argument can be useful when Visage is used as an external screen

@{u}Notes@{uu}:	If a screen promoter is installed, the centering may be wrong
	sometimes. It depends on how the screen mode is changed, and how

@Node COLOR "Visage.guide/Arguments/COLOR"
@Toc ARGUMENTS

	@{u}@{b}COLOR@{ub}@{uu}  Synonym: COLOUR

If this switch is specified, then pictures that normally would be rendered
in a HAM mode, will be rendered in a normal color mode instead.

This switch is mainly intended for owners of graphic cards (especially
those who have ECS Amigas), since it allows Visage to render the picture to
a screen mode supported by the card (although I have heard that there are
cards that support a "faked" HAM8).

The GRAY option will override this one, if both are specified.

@{u}Note@{uu}:	The color rendering is a so called one-pass render with a fixed
	palette. This means that it is rather fast, but the quality is not
	the best. By default, the rendering includes ordered dither, but
	this may be changed, to improve either the speed or the quality
	(the quality will drop significantly if dithering is disabled).

If this switch is specified, then the VERBOSE output will be a bit more
compact. It assumes that your console is wide enough to accommodate all

If this switch is specified, then color cycling will automatically be

@{u}Notes@{uu}:	This cycling only understands "simple" (CRNG) cycling right now. I
	think I know how to implement the "complex" (DRNG) cycling, but I
	have not worked out all details yet. If you have some example code
	or similar, please send it to @{"me" Link AUTHOR}. ;)

	The cycling is done in a high priority subtask. The vertical
	blanking interrupt is not used, since the function used to change
	colors may not be called from an interrupt (it can cause
	deadlocks/crashes). This can make the cycling a bit jerky at times.
	This can not be avoided.

Originally intended as a debugging option (to check the ECS-graphics

Visage think that only ECS graphics is available (not even any graphics
card).

I read somewhere (in fidonet, I think) that some FastJPEG users (that had
AA graphics) used the ECS version in grayscale mode, in order to get a fast
preview of the picture. Using this switch will have the same effect. This
can be especially useful on e.g. an A1200 without fast memory. It will make
the rendering of deep pictures quite a bit faster.

This switch tells Visage that a HAM mode should be selected for IFF ILBMs
that have a depth of 6 bitplanes, and do not have any so called CAMG chunk
(this chunk tells what kind of screen mode that should be used to display
the picture). If not specified, Visage assumes an extra halfbrite (EHB)
mode should be used.

Note that this switch does not force a HAM mode to be used, only that a HAM
mode should be used in case of doubt.

@EndNode


@Node INFO "Visage.guide/Arguments/INFO"
@Toc ARGUMENTS

	@{u}@{b}INFO@{ub}@{uu}

If this switch is specified, then Visage will not display any pictures. It
will simply read some information about the picture, and display that
information.

Thus, all options related to how things are rendered are ignored. However,
screen mode related arguments are not, as the VERBOSE option still may be
used.

This switch is in many ways similar to the TEST switch. The two major
differences are that the picture is not loaded at all, and that VERBOSE is
considered.

This switch overrides TEST and QUIET, if they are specified as well.

If this switch is specified, then Visage will not check if files specified
in the FILES argument or a file requester exists before processing. By
default, Visage will check if the file really exist before attempting to
parse any patterns in the name.

This behaviour is needed, since at this stage Visage does not know if the
file was specified in the FILES argument or if it was a multiselected icon,
as a result of the generic argument parsing functions used. To work around
this problem, Visage will check if the name actually refers to an existing
file.

Since this behaviour can cause some minor problems (i.e., a pattern is not
recognized as expected), you have this switch to decide on how Visage
should behave.

There is a certain confusion regarding this flag and its use. Because of
that (and the fact that different Intuition emulators behave differently in
certain aspects), Visage can get into problems, depending on which
Intuition emulator that is in use. Most notably, Visage can crash when used

If this switch is specified, then Visage will not make certain assumptions
about the contents of the display database (i.e. that a certain flag will
be set for all non-native Amiga modes). This assumption makes Visage work
slightly better (i.e. work faster and/or use less memory) when displaying
pictures in a native Amiga mode.

However, (partly) due to bugs in the current system software, this
assumption is not (always?) correct when a graphics card is installed, and
this can lead to problems. Thus, if Visage seems to be unable to display a
picture on a "graphics card screen mode", then you should try this option.

Thanks to a new way handling things (in Visage 39.2), this switch should
not be needed, but I find it best to make no such assumptions! ;) Also,
Visage is capable of recognizing CyberGraphX modes, so this switch will not
be needed if you have CyberGraphX installed.

The VERBOSE switch can be used to specify how much information that should
be displayed, similar to the output in a Shell. TIME information is
(currently) not displayed on the picture.

This switch is not affected by the QUIET switch.

@{u}Notes@{uu}:	This information is usually not displayed for datatype pictures.
	Re-rendered datatype pictures will have this information though.

	Visage will only use a single line for the text. This means that
	the text can be truncated, if the screen is not wide enough.

	The font used is the one used by the default public screen (at the
	Visage was started), or, if Visage was unable to find the default
	public screen, the current system default font.

	Visage will examine the colormap, and will try to find the best

pictures. Rather, it will try to load them to see if they seem to be free
from errors. When all files have been tested, Visage will print out a
status message, showing if any picture contained any error. Also, if there
was any error, the WARN flag will be set.

For each file that failed with a "data" error, an error message will be
printed, and the COMMAND will be executed (if specified). Errors caused by
external things (such as out of memory) are not considered here.

If this switch is specified, then many other switches and arguments will be
ignored.

If INFO is specified as well, then this switch will be ignored.

@{u}Notes@{uu}:	Only certain errors causes Visage to treat it as a bad. I.e. exit
	with the WARN flag and execute the command.

	Even if a picture "fails", it might still be more or less viewable
	(e.g., it is not much of a problem if the error occurred while
	loading the last few pixel-lines of the picture). Conversely, the
	fact that a picture passes the testing does not mean that the
	picture is free from trashed graphics.

	It seems like most datatypes does not return any error, even if the
	picture contained detectable errors. Thus, you should use the
	NODATATYPES option to make sure that this does not happen.

If this switch is specified (and QUIET is not), then Visage will display
how long it took to load (and possibly render) the picture. This time
does not include the time it took to open the screen in case a datatype
picture was loaded. However, the only case when this can make any
noticeable difference is when you display the picture on a graphics card
screen (on the other hand, the difference can be quite large).

@{u}Note@{uu}:	Since the QUIET option always is on when Visage has been started
	from the Workbench, there is no point in specifying this option in

if possible.

If the SHOWINFO switch has been specified, the extra information will be
displayed on the picture as well.

If this switch is specified, the displayed pictures will be centered
vertically, if needed.

@{u}Notes@{uu}:	If a screen promoter is installed, the centering may be wrong
	sometimes. It depends on how the screen mode is changed, and how
	"good" the promoting software is.

	Due to the implementation, it does not look that good if border
	blanking is enabled (this ca not easily be avoided).

	The centering:

		Only works for datatype pictures that need to be

		Will make the picture use some more graphics memory.

		Should work on all graphic cards (that put proper

@Node MODENAMES "Visage.guide/Algorithmic mode names"

	@{u}@{b}Algorithmic mode names@{ub}@{uu}

An algorithmic name is a name that is built out of information available in
the so called display database. These names are rather similar to the
(English) names seen in e.g. the ScreenMode preferences program, but some
things differ.

But why have different names? Well, the reason is rather simple actually.
The display database only contains names for relatively few screen modes¹.
With these algorithmic names, you can specify any mode using text (in a
consistent manner). You are not limited to the rather few modes the OS
programmers decided to put names on.

	@{" Mode name parts    " Link MN_PARTS}   How a mode name is "constructed".
	@{" Mode name examples " Link MN_EXAMPLES}   Some examples.
	@{" Mode name notes    " Link MN_NOTES}   Some notes about the mode names.

Visage also supports the more traditional (and in some ways simpler) way of
displaying modes without a name, where the name consists of the monitor
name, the screen size, and any special mode flags. Examples:

	PICCOLO:1024x768
	MULTISCAN:320x240 HAM


@{b}-- Footnotes --@{ub}

¹ By using a custom sys/monitors.catalog file, more names can be added. The
problem is that screen mode names are limited to about 30 chars, and this
is not enough for many modes (especially MULTISCAN modes). The algorithmic
names can be much longer (the internal buffer is currently 256 chars ;).

@EndNode


@Node MN_PARTS "Visage.guide/Algorithmic mode names/Mode name parts"

	@{u}@{b}Mode name parts@{ub}@{uu}

A name is made of a couple of components, of which some are required, and
others are optional. The different components are separated from each other
by a single space.

This is the how the mode name should look (required components enclosed in
<>, optional components enclosed in []):

	<@{b}Monitor name:@{ub}><@{b}Horizontal resolution@{ub}> [@{b}Vertical resolution@{ub}]
	[@{b}Special mode flag@{ub}]

And here is an explanation of the different components:

	@{b}Monitor name:@{ub}
	The name of the monitor, including an ending colon (`:'). Example:
	"PAL:".

	@{b}Horizontal resolution:@{ub}
	The nominal horizontal size (i.e. without overscan). Use one of the
	following:
		"Extra-Low Res"  - Less than 200 pixels wide.
		"Low Res"        - Between 200 and 400 pixels wide.
		"High Res"       - Between 400 and 800 pixels wide.
		"Super-High Res" - More than 800 pixels wide.

	@{b}Vertical resolution:@{ub}
	The nominal vertical size (i.e. without overscan). Use one of the
	following:
		"Double" - So called double-scanned mode. Usually less than
			   200 pixels high.
		""       - Normal mode. Usually between 200 and 400 pixels.
			   Sometimes more, up to 5-600 pixels.
		"Laced"  - Interlaced ("flicker") mode. At least 400
			   pixels. Often more.

	@{b}Special mode flag:@{ub}
	The following ones are available:
		"HAM" - Hold And Modify. A special "compressed" mode with
			many colors, but color selection is restricted. six
			or eight bitplanes.
		"EHB" - Extra HalfBrite. 64 colors (six bitplanes). The
			second half of the colors are copies of the first,
			but they are half as bright.

There are a few more special mode flags that could be used, but they are
not useful in this application.

Here are some examples on how the algorithmic mode names can look (English
system defaults in parentheses):

	DblPAL:Low Res                    (DblPAL:Low Res No Flicker)
	Euro72:High Res                   (Euro72:Productivity)

	DblNTSC:Low Res Laced             (DblNTSC:Low Res Laced)
	Super72:Super-High Res Laced HAM  («No equivalent»)

Please note that e.g. the modes `PAL:Low Res' and `DblPAL:Low Res' have
very different aspect with these kind of names! The "equivalent" of
`PAL:Low Res' in DblPAL is `DblPAL:Low Res Double'.

@Node MN_NOTES "Visage.guide/Algorithmic mode names/Notes"
@Toc MN_MODENAMES

	@{u}@{b}Mode name notes@{ub}@{uu}

It is usually not that important to specify the right special mode. If a
special mode is needed, but not specified, then Visage will try to find a
suitable replacement mode.

The strings will be translated if a suitable catalog is installed and used,
but Visage will always understand the English strings listed above. Also
note that the monitor name is never translated.

The algorithmic names are only suitable for native Amiga modes. Visage is
currently only capable of detecting CyberGraphX modes, and will use the
normal display database name (if any) instead. For graphics cards with
other emulation software, I reccommend the use of the NORMALNAMES switch.

@Node RENDERED "Visage.guide/Rendered pictures"

	@{u}@{b}Rendered pictures@{ub}@{uu}

A rendered picture is simply a picture that Visage must do more with, apart
from reading - and possibly unpacking - the data, in order to be able to
display it. Some picture formats (e.g. GIF and JPEG) are not stored in the
normal Amiga bitmap format, and must therefore be converted. Others are in
bitmap form, but your Amiga might not be able to display them anyway (e.g.
24-bit IFF ILBM pictures). These must be converted as well.

The rendering of such pictures can be controlled by using the COLOR, GRAY,
SCALE and DITHER options (and the ECS option).

Datatype pictures is a special case: If the system is not capable of
correctly displaying a datatype picture, Visage will re-render it to a
displayable format. If the system is capable of showing it, no re-render
will be done, as this process costs rather much time and memory.

There is another program in the distribution archive, FixAG, written by
Martin Taillefer. It is used during the installation to add automatic
wordwrapping to the Visage.guide file (this wordwrap requires AmigaGuide
version 39 or higher). It makes a few assumptions about the document
header, so please use it with care. It simply copies the file from the
source to the dest, adds a "@WordWrap"-command in the "header" and removes
linefeeds found in paragraphs from the file.

Finally, in the `Visage/Rexx' drawer, you can find an ARexx script written

	Patterns are not supported.


    @{b}NOTES@{ub}

	The normal Delete command in AmigaOS can not delete a soft link, if
	the target for the soft link has been deleted. The Delete command
	tries to "lock" the file to be deleted, in order to get some
	information about it. For soft links, this locking also means that
	the link will be resolved, i.e. the OS tries to lock the link
	target, not the link itself. If the target file doesn't exist, then
	Delete thinks that there is no file to delete, and quits.

	DeleteLink avoids that problem by instead "blindly" trying to delete
	the file, without first locking it.

	MakeLink [FROM] <Source> [TO] <Dest> [HARD] [SOFT] [FORCE]


    @{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}

	Creates a file on a disk that is a pointer to another file. When an
	application or command calls the FROM file, the TO file is actually
	used. By default, MakeLink makes hard links - the FROM and TO files
	must both be on the same volume.

	To make soft links - which can cross volumes - the SOFT keyword
	must be specified. This might not be supported by all filesystems
	or OS versions.

	Normally, MakeLink does not support drawer links, as they can be
	dangerous to applications. To create a drawer link you must use the
	FORCE option. If MakeLink detects that you are creating a circular
	link, such as a link to a parent drawer, you will receive a Link
	loop not allowed message.


    @{b}OPTIONS@{ub}

	FROM
		The name of the link to be created.

	TO
		The file/drawer the link should point to.

	HARD
		Create a hard link. Hard links can only point to files or
		drawers on the same volume. This is the default.

	SOFT
		Create a soft link. Soft links can point to files or
		drawers on other volumes.

	FORCE
		You must specify this in order to make a drawer link.


    @{b}NOTES@{ub}

	MakeLink requires OS 3.0 or better to operate, as soft links are
	said to not be fully supported in earlier OS versions.

	OS 3.0 seems to only allow the creation of soft directory links. OS
	3.1 supports soft file links as well.

	Not all programs support soft links. Especially soft file links can
	cause problems, and may for example show up as a directory.

	Using soft links can be a bit tricky. If you delete the
	file/directory the soft link points at, then not all programs will
	be able to delete it. In that case, you have to create the file the
	link points to, and then delete the link (and finally the file). Or
	you could use the included @{"DeleteLink" Link DELETELINK} program.

	The complete path to soft links (including the file name) can not
	be more than 256 chars long, due to limitations in the current OS
	version. If you try to create the link anyway, you will get a
	non-functional link.

Visage has been extensively tested on a variety of different Amigas

that there are not many known problems at the moment.

However, there are a couple of things that you should be aware of:

	@{" Back picture visible " Link BACK_PICTURE}
	@{" Bad aspect           " Link BAD_ASPECT}
	@{" Graphic cards        " Link GFX_CARD}

	@{" Screen centering     " Link SCREEN_CENTER}
	@{" Tooltypes ignored    " Link NO_TOOLTYPES}

There is also one bug that I have been unable to fix. Luckily, it is rather
harmless. Sometimes the @{"fade" Link FADE} will stop when the picture is very dark (but
not completely black). I do not know why or when this happens; I have only
noticed it once.

up. After all, bug-free software is a goal that is impossible to reach. :)

@Node BAD_ASPECT "Visage.guide/Known problems/Bad aspect"

	@{u}@{b}Bad aspect@{ub}@{uu}

Some pictures have a strange aspect stored in the file. Thus, if you do get
a strange aspect for a picture, this is the most likely explanation (or
maybe your Amiga does not have a screen mode with a proper aspect). If you
have a graphics card, it is possible that the display database does not
contain proper values (for the modes provided by the graphic card). The
internal BestModeID() function is very strict when it comes to the aspect,
so this should not be the source of the problem.

For certain GIF files (of the GIF89a version) it is possible that Visage
gets the aspect wrong. I hope I have interpreted the GIF specification
correctly, but if not, then the aspect will be wrong. As I don't have any
GIF89a picture that uses this feature, I have not been able to test it. If
you have such a picture (especially one that is displayed incorrectly), I
would appreciate if you could send it to @{"me" Link AUTHOR}.

@Node GFX_CARD "Visage.guide/Known problems/Graphic cards"

	@{u}@{b}Graphic cards@{ub}@{uu}

As I do not own a graphics card myself, it is a bit tricky to ensure that
Visage really works with the "Intuition emulators" most cards have. I do
have a couple of beta testers that have graphic cards though, so Visage
should behave fairly well.

One important thing to remember is that you should use the COLOR switch
(and possibly the DITHER argument as well) if you want to display e.g.
colour JPEG pictures with your graphic card (unless it supports HAM8).

Here is a list over how the most common emulators behaves (according to the
beta testers! ;):

	@{b}EGS@{ub}
	Pictures are displayed properly. However, it seems like the
	background loading does not work. The LOWMEM or LATELOAD option
	should be specified in that case.

	@{b}Picasso@{ub}
	No known serious problems. Possibly some trashed graphics at the
	right side of the picture (but hopefully not). Please note that the
	NOFOREIGN switch might be needed for Visage to work properly (i.e.
	not crash ;).

	@{b}CyberGraphX@{ub}
	No known serious problems. Visage may select the wrong mode
	sometimes, due to errors in the display database.

I have not been able to trace any of the above problems to bugs in Visage

should be noted that newer/older versions of the emulation software may
work differently. Also, the beta testers have not tested the final release

@Node MOUSE_JUMP "Visage.guide/Known problems/Mouse jumping"

	@{u}@{b}Mouse jumping@{ub}@{uu}

During picture loading (especially in the background), the mouse pointer
"jumps" a little horizontally. I do not know if this is specific to my
computer (and all my background utilities), but it does happen for other
picture viewers as well.

I do not know why this happens; if it is due to a bug in Visage (not
likely, considering that other programs have similar "problems") or what.
It seems to be harmless though.

@Node SCREEN_CENTER "Visage.guide/Known problems/Screen centering"

	@{u}@{b}Screen centering@{ub}@{uu}

The screen centering algorithm does not seem to work most "intuition
emulators" for graphic cards (I think I know how this could be worked
around, but I have not bothered with it yet ;).

Also, the centering may be more or less wrong for Super72 screens. The
exact amount depends on the OS version.

@Node NO_TOOLTYPES "Visage.guide/Known problems/Tooltypes ignored"

	@{u}@{b}Tooltypes ignored@{ub}@{uu}

It is possible that the tooltypes specified in the Visage icon are ignored.
This can happen if you e.g. double-click on an icon that has Visage as the
default tool. If the Workbench needs to search the command path for Visage,
it will then pass on information that makes Visage believe that the program
is located in the same drawer as the project icon, which is not the case.
Seems to be a Workbench bug if you ask me. ;) I do not know which versions
of Workbench that have this problem. 3.1 (40.5) has it at least.

To work around this problem, select the project icon, and double-click on
the Visage icon with shift pressed, or make sure the project icon contains
the full path to Visage.

@Node TODO "Visage.guide/The future"

	@{u}@{b}The future@{ub}@{uu}

There are a several things that could be improved or implemented. These are
things I (or a user or beta tester) have though of during the development,
but did not get implemented, either due to lack of information, time,
"interest" (i.e. if I thought it could be useful) or something similar.

Anyway, here is a list over the more important ones:

	Support for PNG (Portable Network Graphics) pictures. Anyone who
	have a small and compact zlib decompressor (preferably in
	assembler)? ;)

	Improve the quality of rendered "deep" pictures in ECS modes. Code
	that detects grayscale pictures could be nice. Future versions of
	the PNG code might help as well.

	Direct support for graphic cards, via EGS and/or CyberGraphX. I
	think I have enough information to implement CyberGraphX support
	(and I have a couple of betatesters), so this is likely to be
	implemented in an upcoming version (next major update perhaps). I'd
	really prefer to be able to test things myself though. ;)

	A GUI mode, to make Visage easier to use, especially from the
	Workbench. This would probably mean a set of menus, and slightly
	different behavior (when the mode is enabled).

	Load more than one picture in the background (similar to FastView).

And a few minor ones:

	Internal multitasking. This would mean that Visage would better
	respond to e.g. cursor keys, while loading a datatype picture.

	Support for superview.library/multipic.library?

If you have any suggestions on what you think should be implemented, feel
free to contact @{"me" Link AUTHOR}.

I have no immediate plans to add the following:

	Animation support. I suggest you use a dedicated animation viewer
	instead, such as BigAnim.

	More picture formats. I do plan to add PNG, but only since this
	seems to be a rather "good" format, that will be used a lot in the
	future. Maybe a few more formats will be added, but I do not know of
	any other right now (and using datatypes is much better for "odd"
	formats anyway).

Various bug fixes to the Xpk support code (it was a last minute addition.
The beta testers never saw it ;):

	Certain seeks did not work. Usually caused crashes if the unpacking
	was breaked.

	After a break, the next picture will be started faster (never
	noticed, due to the bug above ;).

	Errors (during read) was not quite properly handled.

Fixed a bug that caused MungWall hits, but usually nothing else. ;)

Tried to remove the "odd" error requesters some users got after cancelling
the file requester. I am not sure why this happened, but hopefully the
changes will help. If not, I guess I will have to remove it, although this
must be due to some "bad" Asl patcher or something similarly buggy. ;)

Corrected the version string. The last part of the version number should
never have been there.

The working name of the program (PicView) was left in a few places. Funny,
I thought I had searched through the relevant files.. ;)

Please note that my Fidonet address changed to 2:204/204.6 on the 13th of
August ('95)!

Added support for color rendering of pictures, based on code from the
Independent JPEG Group. The quality is not great perhaps (largely based on
the fact that the palette is fixed), but on a 256 color screen the result
is fairly good, at least with dithering.

Now (optionally) @{"dithers" Link DITHER} grayscale @{"rendered" Link RENDERED} pictures on ECS Amigas.
Improved the quality quite noticably.

Made various minor cleanups to the program. Hopefully made it a bit
smaller. ;) (Eaten up by all additions..)

Updated the installer script a bit.

Norwegian translation by Jan-Tore Eliassen included.

Included a simple ARexx script written by Leo Davidson. Its purpose is to
use Visage for a slideshow in DirOpus5.

Removed an Enforcer hit. Only occurred when Visage encountered a file it
could not display, and no other picture was displayed.

Added support for soft file links (the OS handles soft dir links by itself).

Included a @{"MakeLink" Link MAKELINK} clone I wrote quite a while ago, but never released, so
that you can make soft links yourself. Note: This clone has the same size
as the original (MakeLink 37.4)! ;)

Fixed a bug that (probably) could cause the wrong filename to be displayed
sometimes. I never noticed it... ;)

Included DoIconLite by Lars Eilebrecht, to allow easy and flexible update
of the tooltypes in the icon (in the installation script).

Added the @{"TIME" Link TIME} tooltype. So now you can see how long it took to load each
picture. Note: This is another "last minute addition", so do not be
surprised if things does not quite work as expected. ;)

Added @{"COMPACT" Link COMPACT} switch. By default, Visage is now displaying verbose output
on a separate line, to make it look better on consoles with a "limited"
width. Using this switch will revert to the old one-line format.

If an error occurred when using the @{"RANDOM" Link RANDOM} option, some memory (and locks
on drawers) was not always freed.

Updated the asynchronous IO code, to work around a problem when using
SnoopDos with "ShowRexx" active. Caused enforcer hits if Enfocer and
Mungwall was running.

	@{u}@{b}Version 39.2@{ub}@{uu}

	Compile date: November 7, 1995
	Program size: 46312 bytes

Finnish translation by Osma Ahvenlampi included.

The GIF reader sometimes reported odd errors if there was an error in the
picture.

If there was an error in a picture, the error message was printed before
the picture information.

No newline was printed after the error message.

Timing information output was not quite right (leading parenthese was shown
when it should not, and vice versa).

Empty files now get a meaningful error message.

Did some changes to improve RTG support (i.e. an attempt to make it
actually work ;).

Removed an Enforcer hit when using @{"GRAY" Link GRAY} output and @{"DITHER" Link DITHER} NONE.

Added the @{"NORMALNAMES" Link NORMALNAMES} switch, in case you prefer the normal display mode
names (and sizes plus modes for those without a name), or you have a
graphics card.

Fixed a typo in this manual, so that one link to the man page for
DoIconLite works.

Certain constructed mode names were not correct. Could only happen for
"foreign" (normally graphics card) modes without a name. Made a couple of
other changes to the related code.

Implemented color cycling. Added the @{"CYCLE" Link CYCLE} argument, to automatically start
the cycling when needed. This cycling only supports "simple" (CRNG) cycling
at the moment.

@{"SORT" Link SORT} argument added. If specified, then the pictures will be displayed in
alphabetical order. Behaves otherwise as @{"RANDOM" Link RANDOM}.

@{"NOCLICK" Link NOCLICK} argument added. If specified, then Visage will ignore any mouse
clicks on the pictures. To view the next picture or exit, the keyboard need
to be used.

@{"COMMAND" Link COMMAND} argument added. Here a command can be specified, that is executed
when `e' is pressed.

VisageOpts may now contain comments. Comments starts with a `#' or `;' on
the beginning of a line, and ends with the end of that line.

Visage now looks for the file VisageOpts in the drawer specified in the
environment variable ConfigPath, before looking for the environment
variable VisageOpts.

@{"TEST" Link TEST} argument added. Causes pictures to be loaded, but not displayed. If a
picture fails, the @{"COMMAND" Link COMMAND} is executed, if specified.

Fixed a few problems in the installer script.

Cleaned up the output code. The WShell scrollback looks much better now.

If you specify a file in the file requester that refers to a file that
does not exist, then Visage will interpret it as a pattern. This allows you
to select a drawer, and then specify a pattern in a very easy way. ;)

Replaced some catalogs strings.

Rewrote dithering functions into assembler. Overall render speed increased
some 13-18 percent (depending on dither mode) on a rather large (scaled)
JPEG on my system (A4000/040).

Added the @{"RTG" Link RTG} switch. Forced by the fact that Visage assumed a certain
flags in the display database would be set for foreign screen modes, but
due to bugs in some system software, this was not the case. This switch
will make Visage slower on rendering some pictures, and/or use more memory
for datatype pictures, when displayed in native Amiga modes. Thus, it
should only be used when needed; i.e., when a graphics card is installed.

Visage will now always try to use the aspect of the screen mode stored in
an IFF ILBM picture. This did not always happen earlier.

Visage did not render dithered grayscale images properly (the picture was
almost completely black).

Added some simple CyberGraphX support. Visage is now able to properly
recognize a CyberGraphX mode, and will behave accordingly. Thus, the @{"RTG" Link RTG}
switch is not needed if you have CyberGraphX installed.

Replaced the NewIcon image with one drawn by Phil Vedovatti.

Visage sometimes exited without reason when a bad file was found.

Changed to chunky <-> planar conversion code written by John Hendrikx
(except for chunky to planar for 8-bit screens). Shaved some 700 bytes from
the program, and made it a tad faster.

If no password was specified, but one is needed, Visage will now prompt for
one, if ReqTools is available.

Added GRAPHICS as a synonym to STANDARD, for the @{"OVERSCAN" Link OVERSCAN} argument.

Added some safety checks.

Cleaned up some parts of this manual. Also changed the layout a little.

Reduced memory usage during dither and/or color render (at most a couple of
KBs).

Added vertical centering (@{"VCENTER" Link VCENTER}). Note that this looks best if border
blanking is off, due to how it is implemented. It also makes the picture
use more graphics memory.

Fixed a bug that could make gray scale rendering a tiny bit slower than
needed. ;)

Added support for background color in GIFs (of version 89a). Nice when the
border blanking is not on, and/or vertican screen centering is used. Note
that not all GIFs use this feature.

Localized date in "initial about string". ;)

Changed way of rendering interlaced GIFs. Looks much better, but is
slightly slower. This method is not used if the picture is scaled (it will
not look good.. ;).

Changed way of detecting foreign modes. Not as flexible as the old one, but
should work much better. And even if it should become "out of date", the
only drawback will be that Visage sometimes will be a bit slower than
needed. ;) Should hopefully remove the need for the @{"RTG" Link RTG} switch.

Made some more changes for improved RTG support.

Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when started from Workbench via a
project icon.

        Compile date: December 12, 1995
        Program size: 95152 bytes

@{"TEST" Link TEST} option did not work properly. It said "Not enough memory" for all
non-datatype pictures, and did not display picture information for datatype
pictures. Note that it seems like most datatypes doesn't report any error,
even if the picture did contain detectable errors.

Rewrote the scaling functions. The new ones have much higher precision (and
are smaller and simpler, without loss of speed). The scaling should always
make a perfect screen fit now! ;)

Made some other scaling related changes, so that Visage (hopefully) will
make the picture completely visible at all times.

Visage did not properly parse the density (i.e. "reversed" aspect)
information in JPEG pictures.

Tried to remove the trashed graphics that sometimes can be seen to the
right of a picture, when diplayed on a Picasso emulation screen.

Made some further optimizations on the dithering functions (cases DITHER
NONE and DITHER ORDERED). Overall speed increase at most some 6%.

GIF pictures that were larger than specified (in the header) caused
problems for Visage.

Fixed a bug in the @{"SORT" Link SORT} option, that could cause crashes and similar.

Added nifty @{"SHOWINFO" Link SHOWINFO} switch. Displays picture information above the acutal
picture.

Added @{"INFO" Link INFO} switch. Makes Visage display information about the picture, but
not load it.

Cleaned up the datatype reader a bit. Did not improve behavior as I had
hoped (found the reason for it after I hade made the change ;).

Replaced DoIconLite with @{"UpdateTT" Link UPDATETT}. I wrote UpdateTT since DoIconLite did
not quite behave the way I wanted. UpdateTT is also much smaller. ;)

Tried to fix the crashes when promoting IFF ILBM pictures to CyberGraphX
modes.

Improved the @{"TOFRONT" Link TOFRONT} behavior a little.

Missing/incorrect password got no error message. I knew about the problem
before I released version 39.3, but I forgot to fix it! ;)

The "Program size:" field in the version 39.3 information was with all
debug info (it is quite much ;).

Special screen modes (HAM, EHB and similar) was not properly handled when a
MODE argument was specified, possibly causing pictures to be displayed in
the wrong special mode.

The @{"LOWMEM" Link LOWMEM} option caused crashes if "show next picture" was requested

Fixed a bug that caused Visage to not work on CyberGraphX screens (and
quite likely other intuition emulators as well). Introduced in version 39.3
and/or 39.4.

Recompiled with SAS/C 6.56. Reduced size with almost 4 KB.

Fixed an Enforcer hit that occurred when starting Visage from a shell with
the @{"QUIET" Link QUIET} option.

Visage did not always close datatypes.library as needed, when viewing
datatype pictures.

German translation by Lars Eilebrecht included (I got one from Christian
Kemp first, but his translation was not quite complete ;).

Added some more error checking in the GIF unpacker.

When breaking the current picture to view the next, Visage behaved as if
the @{"LOWMEM" Link LOWMEM} switch had been specified.

Visage did not propagate break signals that were recieved during a fade.
Now the fading code simply peeks on the received signals and does not
process them (leaving that for later). This means that Visage will not
react immediately to break signals during the fade, but to fix that would
cost more work than I would like to spend right now. ;)

Argh! Catalog generation went haywire in version 39.3. :/ Why did not
anyone notice this eariler? ;)

If @{"SHOWINFO" Link SHOWINFO} was specified, but there were no @{"vertical centering" Link VCENTER} or @{"scaling" Link SCALE},
then Visage could calculate the wrong screen height, and would quite likely
trash some graphics memory.

Visage would quit on certain errors (such as file did not exist).

Switched on invisible typing in the password requester.

Visage sometimes ignored "show next picture" requests.

Misc cleanups and optimizations. I hope I did not break anything fixed
above. ;)

Changed so that @{"UpdateTT" Link UPDATETT} only requires OS 2.04+. I made it require OS 3.0
for no real reason. ;) Added a proper version string. Recompiled with SAS/C.

	Program size: 45204 bytes

Removed some debug output in a BestMode related function (forgot to do it
in 39.5 ;).

Some errors in the GIF reader wasn't properly reported.

Certain "early" picture errors caused Visage to crash.

The IFF reader would crash when rendering to foreign screen modes
(including when the @{"RTG" Link RTG} switch had been used, since it makes Visage assume
all modes are foreign).

Interlaced GIF pictures weren't alway rendered properly. It seems like it
didn't always render the final pixel line. While at it, I cleaned up the
responsible code.

Fixed a quirk in the Installer script (selecting English catalog for
installation didn't work).

The color selection for the @{"SHOWINFO" Link SHOWINFO} text didn't always produce the
correct result, possibly making the text invisible.

Added pattern support for the @{"MONITOR" Link MONITOR} argument.

Added the @{"NOICON" Link NOICON} switch. Makes Visage ignore any `#?.info' files
enountered.

Increased the date buffer, when displaying the about message. This to solve
the problem for an Italian user, with a buggy Italian locale. Since I
assume other users (mostly Italian, I guess ;) can have this problem as
well (i.e. Visage crashes when right after displaying the about message), I
made this simple workaround.

Changed the @{"NORMALNAMES" Link NORMALNAMES} behaviour a little. When specified, then the
display database names will be checked first, when using the @{"MODE" Link MODE}
argument. The behaviour here was not clearly defined earlier.

Visage will now remap datatype pictures the system can't display. This is
needed for proper behaviour on ECS Amigas. This forced me to change back to
the old (and somewhat slower) planar to chunky converting code, as it is
more generic. It is still much faster than the ROM code. ;)

Added the @{"NOFOREIGN" Link NOFOREIGN} switch, to make Visage work better with certain
Intuition emulators (most notably the PicassoII). If Visage tended to crash
for you - especially when you didn't specify a display mode yourself - then
you should try this switch.

Some minor internal improvements...

Improved argument handling for tooltypes. Strings with quotation characters
were not properly handled. The main candidate for this problem was the
@{"COMMAND" Link COMMAND} argument.

Improved mode selection for PCHG pictures (so that modes that do not
support such pictures are avoided).

French and Italian catalogs updated.

Visage should now work better with the V43 picture.datatype and truecolor
(24-bit) images.

Datatype re-rendering was not correctly done for HAM8 pictures.

Made some other minor changes and cleanups to the datatype reader.

The text displayed by the @{"SHOWINFO" Link SHOWINFO} switch was not displayed on the right
position, sometimes making text clipped (due to the font I normally use, I
did not notice the problem. I know; should have tested with some other
fonts ;).

The task creation code were doing somewhat naughty things, causing Mungwall
hits (however, this did work with the current OS versions). Changed to more
proper behaviour.

Russian and Spanish translations included.

Clearified the behaviour of the @{"VisageOpts" Link VISAGEOPTS} configuration.

Visage did not always clean up properly when aborted. This would usually
only happen for datatype pictures.

Visage did not behave consistently if @{"WAITFORPIC" Link WAITFORPIC} was specified, and you
asked Visage to view the next picture. Now Visage will never wait in this
particular case. Cleared up the manual on this part as well.

Tweaked the startup code a little.

Funny... I just found out that (most) DOS function indeed does support soft
links, at least in OS 3.1. How come I did not notice this before, when I
added the "soft link support" code in Visage in the first place? As I think
of it, the error code was a bit odd. ;) Anyway, that code have now been
removed, saving a few bytes.

Upcoded @{"MakeLink" Link MAKELINK} to C and added soft link detection. It will now state that
links between volumes needs the SOFT keyword, rather than saying something
like "object not of require type".

Increased miminal bitmap width from 16 to 80, when running under OS 3.0.
This should fix the improperly displayed narrow pictures (i.e. those less
than 80 pixels wide).

When specifying the @{"NOICON" Link NOICON} switch, then the file requester will not
include any icons either.

Visage now sanity checks some picture parameters to prevent problems.
Earlier, pictures with e.g. a depth of zero would cause crashes.

Rendering deep grayscale (more than 16 shades) pictures on ECS Amigas with
dithering turned off didn't look very well. Fixed.

Visage always (?) treated files selected in a file requester as having
patterns, when MuFS was installed, due to a bug in Visage. As a result,
files containg pattern characters couldn't be selected (without some extra
work).

Added spanish translation of the installer script.

@Toc HISTORY

	@{u}@{b}Version 39.11@{ub}@{uu}

	Compile date: 96-12-08
	Program size: 45148 bytes

Norwegian translation updated. Added translations for Dutch (I've had the
actual translation since 39.8, but no catalog was made for it, nor was the
install script updated ;) and Serbian (at least I assume that is what
Srpski stands for ;). Updated the installer script to install Russian
catalogs as well.

Added the @{"NOFILECHECK" Link NOFILECHECK} switch, and changed the behaviour in the file
requester a bit. If the switch is not specified, then Visage will always
check if a specified file exists, rather than process it as a pattern. This
solves the problem with failing to display pictures with pattern characters
in the name or the path, especially when Visage is started from the
Workbench. The drawback is that patterns might not always be treated as you
like. Hence the switch.

The release archive is now created a bit differently. Should hopefully fix
the uploading problems I've experienced (most likely caused by Unix LhA
failing on the Visage archive. I've removed some archiving options likely
to cause problems according to Stefan Boberg). The 39.10 release didn't
make it either... :)

Added the @{"BORDERBLANK" Link BORDERBLANK} option.

Recompiled with SAS/C 6.57.

Wrote the @{"DeleteLink" Link DELETELINK} command.

Added version string to MakeLink, and recompiled it with SAS/C 6.57.
