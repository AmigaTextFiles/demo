*NOSYNC BY UNIVERSE! *
*************************
in march 2003 for the Equinoxe Party (Paris) organized by M4nkind.

NoSync is a WarpOs demo done mainly at party place.

IT IS NOT A SERIOUS DEMO! It is just a demo done in some hours, for the fun of the competition.

NoSync is now fixed, working on Amiga, Pegasos, big and little endian graphic card (Bvision/Cvision/Voodoo/Radeon and much more)

THIS DEMO CAN'T EXIT while running. Just wait the end. But when you launch a demo, why quiting it? ;)
Why can't exit? Because we are lamers. We use MPEGA in a script to play music.

MUSIC:
-You have to configure the modeid used by MPEGA. The archive allready contain a .bat for Paula, Pegasos, and Repulse. If you have another sound card, just choose a modeid and set it with -I0x in a .bat (have a look at our exemples)
-If you have a delfina DSP, you can also remove MPEGA of the script and use DelfMPEG.

VARIOUS:
Why is this demo called NoSync? Because audio/video is not synchronised ;) NoSync will be the name of all our next "party place" torched demos.

By the way. NoSync is also buggy a lot. Don't remove data files, don't launch it if you don't have enough memory. But who is stupid enough to try running a demo with no ressources?

REQUIEREMENT:
-PowerPC processor (604e is best, demo run hires!) or Pegasos.
-WarpOs or WOSemu (MorphOs)
-640*480*16 screenmode in CGXMODE
-AHI
-mpega.library
-mpega 3.5 (And 3.5 only for best performance! included.)
