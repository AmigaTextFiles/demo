 this tiny prog is some kind of a 'sampling oscilloscope'. it uses
 the parallel port sampler, if you don't have one, then this prog
 will be useless for you.

 requires: AGA/68020+/OS V37+

 the sampling rate is 16kHz so frequencies above 8kHz will not be
 visible. if you say now 'this is not very much' then i wanna tell you:
 16kHz means that during every pal-frame we receive 320 bytes so it fits
 perfectly on a lores screen. and there's simply not enough cpu power
 on todays amigas to use a higher resolution for this task. (i think ;-)

 the prog is controlled via keyboard so try these:
  F1 - lores 20ms display
  F2 - hires 40ms display
  F3 - single dot
  F4 - eight average dots
  F5 - line  (*)
  F6 - solid (*)
  F7 - spectrum analyzer
  F9 - show idle cpu time
  F10- freeze display
  ESC- exit

 NOTE: the modes marked with (*) need different amounts of cpu time
       depending on the current sample data.
       if the screen borders get red then the plotting routine runs
       too slow. to avoid this you could   a) get a powerful cpu and
       some fast ram   b) use F2 for 40ms display   c) if that doesn't
       help choose a different plotting mode

 ABOUT THE SPECTRUM ANALYZER:

 it uses a 128-point fourier transformation which seems to be quite accurate.
 each bar represents a band of about 125Hz, the 64 bars go upto 8kHz.

 the spectrum analyzer always scans only 256 bytes of the sample,
 this is due to the fft loop, sorry! if your machine is fast enough you
 should run it on 20ms display, so you 'miss' only 64 bytes each frame
 which is 20% of the whole sample. on 40ms display your chances to miss
 short impulses (such as hihats etc.) are 60%...
 i don't know how to fix the problem of these 'time gaps' without coding
 a new fft loop from scratch!



 and remember: this is only a programming experiment. you can't claim
 me for any damages or trouble my prog could cause. it's all your
 fault coz you dared to start it ;-)

 HISTORY

 170195
  -first release

 190195
  -FFT spectrum analyzer implemented
    NOTE: in this first version there are some 'inaccuracies' in the
    frequency range. i will fix it as soon as i get some equipment to
    calibrate the frequencies. and maybe i'll implement 'acoustic scaling'
    which linearizes the spectrum like the human ear does.

 200195
  -spectrum analyzer calibrated (using Masque's Chicken Dialer!!)
  -peak levels implemented

 240195
  -code optimizing
  -fixed a serious bug in the sampling routine that appeared on the 68030
   but not on the 68020!  (strange?   it was caused by an unintentional
   instruction overlap in the cpu's pipeline.)

 310195
  -sprite anim built in -> dramatical file length increase, but who cares?!
   the logo can be switched on/off using the HELP key
