»» Digital Innovation HD-Loader made by Zer0-X! ««

Here's what you're going to need to watch this oldie demo from HardDisk:

- An Amiga(!)
- ½Mb ChipMem
- 1Mb FastMem   (Maybe 1½Mb?)
- Harddrive

I think everyone should have these nowadays!

Use the install-script provided to copy your disk to HardDisk!
