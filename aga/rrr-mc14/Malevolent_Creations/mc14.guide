                          @{" - About the Authors - " link "what"}


    We take absolutely no responsibility whatever the buttons below may
      cause to your health, sanity, little niece or something else. 
    If you are not interested in your life as it is now, just go ahead.
                    You will never be the same. Never.

                           YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED


 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Animation Experiment " system "data/0a.dat data/141.dat blank reltime 5"}

 We start our cruel charade with a scientific experiment. As everyone 
 knows, science stops at nothing and has absolutely no regard for ethics 
 or moral values. Here you see how ethic and moral values spend their
 pitiful lives in little experiment chambers. They have drawn the 
 shortest straw, and it is their final fate... to be ruthlessly 
 twisted and manipulated by the omnipotent forces of science.

 Note: Do not try to find out which of the buggers are ethics,
 and which are moral values. Even respected authors on the field
 are not absolutely certain.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Colores Fugient " system "data/0a.dat data/142.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Ka[52b3] is a system without color. Even the cutest forms of life
 look just pale shadows of themselves. It is not known what kind
 of cataclysm led to this unfortunate situation. Some say it was 
 the execution of No_More_Color() while others claim the constant
 overloading of the spectrum caused it to collapse upon itself.

 However, a project is underway to re-establish the RGB values 
 in the system. Its still in an early phase.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Identiteettikriisit " system "data/0a.dat data/143.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Sometimes we wonder if something really is what it seems.
 We can show you a glimpse through the curtains of mystery 
 and demonstrate how your aural/visual sensors fail daily. 

 And even though the true nature of an entity could be revealed, 
 it would soon become clear that the Truth is just another Lie.

 Are you what you seem to be? Does a feeling of worthlessness
 sometimes overcome you? Does a sense of inferiority engulf you?.. Yes... 
 When the day of our Ur-Quan masters comes, you shall surely know.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Utopian Laivaristeily " system "data/0a.dat data/144.dat blank reltime 5"}

 In the back of your mind you recognize something familiar. A faint
 shadow passes through your brain, a feeling of nostalgy and longing.

 Visions flow, times now long gone are glimpsed in fleeting moments. 
 But there should be something more. Great achievements, jojoys
 victories and sad losses. The curse of pharaohs, the tourist hordes...
 Something must be wrong with your memory. Perhaps it was just a dream.

 For you, all that is no more. Your Utopian friends are gone.
 All you have left is the burden of your years and the knowledge 
 of death drawing near. Imagine yourself, a sad old creature
 watching a tourist vid. There is no return to Utopia.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" World of Blocks " system "data/0a.dat data/145.dat blank reltime 5"}

 How wonderful is the block! Just like the juicy humans, it can be
 divided, separated, coloured, multiplied and then constructed all
 over again. With a suitable collection of blocks, universes can be built, 
 wars waged and romances romanced. 

 Ordered, permuted, combined, steamboiled and jugulated. 
 All performed by a queue of blocks.

 It is known that soon you will cease to exist. The place you occupied
 will be occupied by a block, your world a hegemony of blocks. 
 All coordinated by the Evil Overblock.
