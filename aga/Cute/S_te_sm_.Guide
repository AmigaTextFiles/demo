@Node 2 "About!!!"

This song was made by Sorg and 'Spanky Girl...' in a couple of hours!
If you wonder what @{b}'Søte Små'@{ub} means, it Norwegian for Cute small (directly)
If you are interested in a "full" version with the lyrics sung by Sorg and
'Spanky Girl...' Just contact us well se what we can fix!

Credits:
Composed by Sorg
Structure and concept by Sorg, 'Spanky Girl...'
Lyrics by Sorg, 'Spanky Girl...'
This guide by Sorg

The concept of the song is the mental state of a rape-pedophile man who has
remorse for what the hell he is doing to the children he rapes!
The lyrics holds some explicit contents and should not be viewed by minors!
The stile of the lyric is much like Norwegian Black Metal, (GV)!

Me (Sorg) would especially like it if there was any feedback on the song! So
if you got any bad or good comments on the song, feel free to send them to
our e.mail!
