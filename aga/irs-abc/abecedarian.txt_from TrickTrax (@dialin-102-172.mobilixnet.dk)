Personal greetings from Ransom.

TrickTrax: Thank you for taking you time to introduce me to the world
           of asm. And for helping me pulling this thing together, I could
           not have done it without you :)

Cupid & Talpa: Thanks for all your tips, and for taking your time to listen
               to and answer some of my stupid questions.

Tenalady: For helping me out with some of the math, and being a lovely
          girlfriend :)

Vanvid: For misc. help.

And sorry about the speed on 030 machines, I hope to learn more optimising
tricks in the future :)


A little word from TrickTrax:

The music have some clicks in it on A1200, I fear. Nothing to do about it this
late before deadline, so yo'll have to live with it. Sorry for that. By the
way, I think Ransom did a pretty good job with the coding after only 3 months.
Expect to see more from him (I hope :))

Thanks to Tylon & Luc for letting us test the demo at TRSAC before deadline.

A personal greeting from TrickTrax to Adonis for keeping the spirit and
driving halfway across Denmark to drive us all to TRSAC :) And one to
Unreal/Faculty for being the best graphician on the scene these days.

TRSAC IS A GREAT PARTY!!!
