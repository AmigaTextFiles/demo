Some old (more than year actually) sources. This intro won 64k intro 
competition at IO4 in 1997. Do whatever you want with that (ie. see
how to support cgfx cards and support them in your own productions).
Do not ask me about the code,do not send me letters if something
can not be compiled. I dont care.

  Anyway - have fun.
