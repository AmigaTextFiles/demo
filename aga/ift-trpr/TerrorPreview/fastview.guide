@node Introduction "FastView: Introduction"

FastView is a program which shows IFF, GIF, BMP, PCX and JPEG
pictures on your screen.  Of course many programs exist for this
task, but this one is special because it is very fast and was
designed with both OCS/ECS and AGA users in mind.  For example:
FastView can show HAM8 and IFF24Bit pictures on OCS/ECS machines
in HAM which was one of the things I missed in all the other
viewing-programs I've seen.

JPEG pictures are shown using the Tower JPEG Codec Class by
Christoph Feck.

@node Features "FastView: Features"

 - Displays any IFF ILBM picture (even HAM8 or 24Bit pictures) in HAM on
   OCS/ECS machines.  Of course if the picture doesn't need to be rerendered
   in HAM it will use a normal OCS/ECS screenmode.  On AGA machines FastView
   will show the pictures if possible in upto 256 colors or in HAM8

 - Displays GIF pictures of 17 or more colors in HAM on OCS/ECS machines.
   If less colors are used HIRES-INTERLACED will be used.  On AGA machines
   GIFs always get displayed in upto 256 colors

 - Uncompressed BMP pictures in 2, 16 or 256 colors and 24-bit BMP pictures
   are supported

 - Handles EGA and VGA PCX pictures (from 2 to 256 colors and 24-bit)

 - JPEG pictures are supported via the Tower JPEG Codec Class by Christoph
   Feck.  FastView will display both grayscale and color JPEGs in HAM6
   or HAM8 depending on your machine.

 - AmigaDOS patterns (wildcards) are supported

 - Runs from CLI and Workbench

 - Optional Dithering of rerendered pictures (ie. pictures which are
   converted from 256 colors to HAM6, or from 24Bit to HAM8 etc...)

 - If multiple pictures were specified on the command line FastView will
   automatically load and decode the next picture while you're still
   viewing the previous one

 - Optional (Down)Scaling of rerendered pictures to fit screen

 - On OCS/ECS machines FastView tries to recognize pictures with B&W
   palettes and will display these in HIRES-INTERLACED instead of HAM

 - FastView has the ability to pick an ideal set of colors for pictures
   rendered to HAM6 or HAM8.  It can store these colors in the picture's
   comment so they can be used next time you view the same picture to get
   very high quality pictures

 - Very fast conversion to HAM/HAM8

 - FastView can save your pictures as IFF files

 - Keyboard can be used to scroll picture (or the mouse of course)

 - Coded in 100% Assembler (only 24K in size!)

@node UsageWB "FastView: Usage from Workbench"

There are 3 ways to use FastView from the Workbench:

1) Simply double-click on the FastView icon and it will come up with a
   File requester which allows you to select the pictures you want to view.
   You may select multiple pictures by holding down shift during selection.

2) You can view pictures by using extended selection: Select the FastView
   icon and select, while holding down the shift key, the pictures you want
   to view.  Double-click (while still holding down shift) on the last
   picture you want to view to start FastView.

3) You may use FastView as the default tool for your pictures.  To set the
   default tool to FastView for a picture, simply select the picture's icon
   and choose Icons/Information from the Workbench menu.  Set the default
   tool field to FastView and save this setting.  Now you can simply
   double-click on the picture to view it with FastView.  Selecting
   multiple pictures is also allowed, as long as the last picture you've
   selected has the default tool set to FastView.

The FastView icon can have several Tool Types which control the way FastView
operates.  Most of these ToolTypes work similair compared with their
CLI counterparts.  Here are the Tool Types available which also are available
in the CLI:

   DITHER             NOBESTMODEID
   NOLACE             POINTER
   SCALE              ROM
   INFO               SCREENMODE
   MAKECOMMENT        WAITFORPIC

For more information about the function of each tooltype please refer to
the @{" Usage from CLI " link UsageCLI} section.

There is also one Workbench specific ToolType:

   DEFAULTDIR

This ToolType allows you to set the dir which FastView will list
in the File Requester when you start FastView by simply
double-clicking on it (Method 1, see above).

@endnode

@node UsageCLI "FastView: Usage from CLI"

There is nothing to it really.  Just start it from the CLI or install
it in your favourite Directory utility.

Command line:

 FILES/M,DITHER/S,NOLACE/S,SCALE/S,DELAY/K/N,INFO/S,WAITFORPIC/S,ROM/S,
 NBMI=NOBESTMODEID/S,MAKECOMMENT/S,POINTER/S,SAVE/K,DEBUG/S,MULTISAVE/S,
 SM=SCREENMODE/K

or:

 [FILES][=]<string(s)> [DITHER] [NOLACE] [SCALE] [DELAY[=]<number>]
 [INFO] [WAITFORPIC] [ROM] [(NBMI/NOBESTMODEID)] [MAKECOMMENT]
 [POINTER] [SAVE[=]<string>] [DEBUG] [MULTISAVE]
 [(SM/SCREENMODE)[=]<string>]


FILES/M
 
This argument is not required.  If you don't specify any files FastView
will pop up a file requester where you can select which pictures you want
to view.  You can use AmigaDOS patterns (wildcards) to make viewing
multiple pictures easier.  You can add as many names/patterns on the
command line as you want, and all pictures will be viewed in the order you
specified.  (Note:  Patterns matching multiple pictures will be shown in a
somewhat random order) In case you're viewing multiple pictures the Right
Mouse button will act as an abort function, thus it will enable you to exit
FastView completely at any time.  Left Mouse button will continue to the
next picture.


DELAY/K/N

Using this option you can turn FastView into a slideshow.  It allows you to
set the number of seconds each picture will be displayed.  Note that
FastView will automatically load the next picture in the background while
you're still viewing the current picture, which makes slideshows look much
better.


DITHER/S

Specify this on the command line if you want to add a simple form of
dithering to the (rerendered) pictures.  This will slow down FastView by
about 50%.


NOLACE/S

Specify this to make sure FastView doesn't use interlaced displays.


SCALE/S

When you specify this on the command line FastView will scale down
(rerendered) pictures so they will fit on your screen, while keeping the
aspect ratio intact.


INFO/S

Add this to the command line if you want the filename of the picture you're
viewing to be displayed at the top of the display.


WAITFORPIC/S

When used in conjunction with the DELAY keyword WAITFORPIC will ensure that
the picture being decoded in the background is fully decoded before
FastView switches to the next picture.  This should make slideshows look a
bit better.


ROM/S

This will make FastView use ROM functions (WritePixelLine8) to draw the
pictures instead of poking directly into the screen's bitmap.  This is only
partially implemented and for now will only work on IFF24Bit pictures, JPEG
and GIF pictures.  Comments from graphics card users on this function are
welcomed!


NOBESTMODEID/S or NBMI/S

This switch will disable the use of FastView's BestModeID
routine.  This is a completely rewritten version of the
BestModeID found in V39 kickstarts and should work much better.
Another bonus is that this routine functions from Kickstart 2.0
and up.

You can try this switch if FastView picks the 'wrong' screenmode
to display your picture.  Normally this shouldn't happen, so if
it does check your DEVS:Monitors drawer and see if there are any
monitors in there your system can't display correctly, if so
remove these monitors, reboot and try again.  If the problem
persists try the DEBUG option and send me its output and some
information about the problem.  See DEBUG for more information.


MAKECOMMENT/S

If you specify this keyword FastView will automatically calculate the
optimal palette for the pictures you're viewing and store this palette in
the comment of those pictures.  Next time you view a picture FastView will
use the palette stored in the comment which should ensure you get a bit
higher quality pictures.  This only works for pictures which are displayed
in either HAM6 or HAM8.


POINTER/S

Specify this on the command line if you don't want FastView to blank the
mouse pointer after decoding the pictures.


SAVE/K

This keyword enables you to save a single picture as an IFF file.  This
turns FastView in a very simple conversion utility.  Simply specify the
name of the picture after the keyword and the first picture which is viewed
is saved as an IFF file using the specified name.  Don't forget the DITHER
option, it often makes the rendered picture (and thus also the picture it
saves) look a lot better.

If you want to save an entire dir of pictures then specify
MULTISAVE on the command line as well.  This will change the
behaviour of the SAVE keyword.  When using MULTISAVE you should
specify the extension which should be appended to the name of the
files you're viewing using the SAVE keyword.  Example:

  FastView foo.gif bar.gif SAVE=.iff MULTISAVE

This line would result in FastView displaying both pictures and saving
them as 'foo.gif.iff' and 'bar.gif.iff'.


DEBUG/S

If you have problems with FastView picking the wrong ScreenMode you might
want to set this option and post me the results.  Using this option you get
a list of all ScreenModes FastView considers to be good enough to display
your picture.  The final line contains the ScreenMode FastView found to
be the best available.


MULTISAVE/S

This will allow you to save multiple pictures, using the SAVE
keyword to specify the extension to be appended to the names of
the pictures, see the SAVE keyword for more information.


SCREENMODE/K or SM/K

People owning VGA monitors or owners of graphics cards may want
to tell FastView which ScreenModes it is allowed to choose from
when looking for the best ScreenMode to display a certain
picture.  You can do this with the SCREENMODE option.  It accepts
a string which specifies which ScreenMode(s) FastView may choose
from.  This string may contain AmigaDOS patterns (wildcards) for
maximum flexibility.  Examples:

  ScreenMode="DBL#?"

This will allow FastView only to pick DBLPAL or DBLNTSC modes (ie,
ScreenModes which start with 'DBL'.

  ScreenMode="~(#?low#?)" 

Using this ScreenMode string FastView will never select any ScreenModes
which contain the word 'low'.  This means modes like "PAL:Low Res"
and "MULTISCAN:Extra-Low Res" won't be picked.


Keys while viewing pictures:

 Arrow keys or the Numeric Keypad can be used to scroll the screen

 Holding shift while scrolling will use larger steps
 Holding alt while scrolling scrolls one pixel at the time

 Space, Enter  - Skip to next picture
 Escape        - Exit FastView completely

@endnode

@node Future "FastView: Future"

Here is a list of things I want to add to FastView later:

 A NOVIEW keyword which will turn FastView into a CLI utility to convert
 and save pictures in IFF format, without you having to view the actual
 picture(s).

 The possibility to load/decode more than one picture while the user is
 viewing the current one

 Support for the IFF PBM format produced by DPaint 2 enhanced (pc version)

If you have suggestions for new features which you think would be
nice to have in FastView, don't hesitate to contact me about
them.

@endnode

@node Bugs "FastView: Known bugs"

While you're viewing a picture and you switch back to another screen the
FastView screen/window will get deactivated which will break the Delay
function.  This is because FastView won't receive IntuiTicks messages
from Intuition while its window is deactivated, and so can't tell when
the Delay time is over.

FastView doesn't check the result of CloseScreen().  If you use another
program like Lens which opens a window on the FastView screen and you
accidently exit FastView while the window is still open, FastView will
simply forget about the screen (leaving it opened) and exit.

@node History "FastView: History"

Aug 20 1994 - V0.90 - Added GIF decoding
Aug 24 1994 - V0.91 - Speeded up HAM conversion routine by almost 20%;
                      Speeded GIF conversion by about 5%; LMB now also
                      exits the viewer when displaying a GIF
Aug 25 1994 - V0.92 - Handles interlaced GIFs; Uses LoRes HAM if picture
                      is smaller than 320x256; Displays B&W pictures in
                      Hires 16 colors instead of HAM
Aug 26 1994 - V0.93 - Almost doubled IFF displaying speed thanks to the
                      BackFill-Hooks (Other picture types will also
                      benefit from this)
Aug 27 1994 - V0.94 - Displays uncompressed IFFs
Aug 31 1994 - V0.95 - Finally figured out how to convert HAM8 to 24Bit
                      (it turned out IFF-HAM8 has its control-bits as
                      bit 6 and 7...); Added Dithering for pictures
                      which are converted to HAM or B&W
              V0.96 - Now outputs info about the picture; Possible to
                      specify multiple pictures on command line and RMB
                      now exits completely when viewing multiple
                      pictures; Uses BusyPtr while decoding; Blanks

                      Also added NOINTERLACE command line option
Sep  5 1994 - V0.98 - Added variable (Down)Scaling; Now centers picture
                      if it is too small (this avoids the trash at the
                      right-edge due to Hardware limitations)
Sep  8 1994 - V0.99 - No longer crashes when a BadCode is encountered
                      in a GIF file

                      pictures not to be displayed
Sep 20 1994 - V1.03 - Fixed problem with IFF pictures which weren't
                      exactly the same width as the screen; Added
                      rendering to HAM8 for AGA machines
Sep 25 1994 - V1.04 - Fixed Enforcer hit when no palette was found in
                      picture; Added Wildcard support
Sep 29 1994 - V1.05 - Fixed LoadRGB4 code; Fixed bugs in Wildcard
                      support which caused memory freed twice errors;
                      Fixed HAM8 support
Oct  3 1994 - V1.06 - Added simple local-colormap handling code to GIF
                      decoder; When initial codesize was too small or
                      too big GIF decoder crashed, bug fixed

                      for its initial window-size (requested by: Edmund
                      Vermeulen); FastView now checks if the user
                      specified a path, and copies this in the path field

              V1.37 - When using the ROM option FastView now uses
                      WritePixelLine8() instead of WritePixel()

                      on AGA
Apr 21 1995 - V1.41 - Added ROM and WAITFORPIC tooltypes; Fixed bug which
                      caused a crash when a picture is too big to
                      display; When using Delay and WaitForPic FastView
                      didn't exit after showing you the last picture
May  2 1995 - V1.42 - Some pictures weren't saved correctly under AGA,
                      fixed; Fixed enforcer hit when passing NULL as the
                      path for the ASL requester under V40 (works fine
                      for V39 and earlier)
May  4 1995 - V1.43 - Added DEBUG option; When you select no files in
                      the ASL requester FastView assumes you want to view
                      the entire directory
May  5 1995 - V1.44 - Specifying MULTISAVE on the commandline together
                      with SAVE will save all pictures viewed as IFF

                      the extension
May 18 1995 - V1.45 - Removed a bug in the 68000 version of FastView which
                      caused some GIF pictures to be trashed; FastView no
                      longers specifies Workbench as the public screen to
                      pop-up on
              V1.46 - FastView now uses a custom routine to replace
                      BestModeID.  This routine will hopefully work correct
                      with graphics cards and/or Kick 2.0; Added SCREENMODE
                      keyword which allows you to specify the name of the
                      monitor you wish to use (supports AmigaDOS patterns)

May 26 1995 - V1.49 - Fixed bug causing crashes when exiting FastView which
                      was started from Workbench; Fastview now checks for
                      Ctrl + C and exits when it receives one
May 30 1995 - V1.50 - Fixed bug, ROM ToolType now works; Fixed bug which
                      caused some pictures to be saved wrong; Fixed bug

Jun  3 1995 - V1.51 - No longer picks Graphics-card screenmodes for HAM
                      pictures; FastView now will run without monitor
