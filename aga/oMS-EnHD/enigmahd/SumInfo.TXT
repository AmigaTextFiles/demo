»» Enigma HD-Loader made by Zer0-X! ««

Here's what you're going to need to watch this CLASSIC demo from HardDisk:

- An Amiga(!)
- ½Mb Chip
- 1½Mb Fast     (You users can also view this with 2Mb CHIP! P->)
- Harddrive

I think everyone should have these nowadays!


Use the install-script provided to copy your disk to HardDisk!
