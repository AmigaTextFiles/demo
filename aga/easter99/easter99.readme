EASTER ANIMATION

This is a Videotracker 'vidule' that can be run straight from floppy disk 
on startup, since it is self-contained and has within itself all that is 
needed.  It runs on a bottom-of-the-line Amiga 1200 with a single floppy 
disk - we turn it on and off with a timer.  Simply copy all the files
to a bootable floppy and boot off it.

THE CONTENT

This animation is a portrayal of some of the meanings of Easter.

Is Death the end?  Watch carefully: this question flashes up briefly at the 
start of the animtion.  Death is then shown wiping out both humanity and 
nature.  But when it meets the Cross of Christ, Death itself is swallowed 
up, leaving the message: Christ Conquers Death.  This is the main animated 
sequence, and reappears in bits throughout the cycle.

Much of the cycle is pure visuals - circles, wire shapes, moire patterns, 
colour cycling, and the like - which have no deliberate symbolic meaning. 
At various places throughout the cycle, various short messages appear:
      "Christ died for us; Christ is Risen"
      "Christ - that we might truly live"
      "Jesus"
      and the Christian symbol of the Cross.
The Cross was the means of execution used to kill Jesus Christ nearly 2000 
years ago.  Nails were driven through your wrists into a cross piece, and 
you hung from them, arms stretched wide in the baking sun, until you die.

The message is that Christ, both fully God and fully human, died, not just 
because he annoyed the authorities of the day, but for us.  To sort out the 
mess we had made - and still make of the world.  But God is stronger than 
Death, so he rose back to life.  And we celebrate this on Easter Day.

THE TECHNOLOGY

This animation is played by Videotracker, a software package for the Amiga 
that puts visual events on the screen in time with a music track.  Each 
event - starting an animation, putting up a picture, changing colours, etc. 
- is attached to an instrument and comes up when that instrument is played.

The animation makes full use of the special hardware features of the Amiga:
        Fast swapping between visual fields: that is how the animation
      manages to show things in fast sequence.
        'Dual playfield', in which two visual fields are shown, one behind
      the other: for instance, see the moire fringe effects when two sets
      of circles move with respect to each other.
        Copper list, in which the colour registers are changed as the
      video beam makes its way down the screen: most of the screens use
      eight or fewer colour registers, but the smooth shading down the
      screen in some parts is from this effect.
        Colour cycling, in which the colour registers are changed from
      frame to frame, so that colours come and go.
        Videoline shift, in which each line on the screen can be shifted
      slightly to right or left: see the 'wobble' in some parts.
        High efficiency: the animation is run on a bottom-of-the-range
      Amiga 1200, (a mere 2 Mb of memory, 14MHz clock), single floppy disk.
        Safe switch-off: as long as the Amiga is not actually accessing
      the disks, it can be switched off without having to be 'closed down'.
        Fast, automatic start-up: the Amiga starts up in a few seconds
      from switch-on, loading the animation straight away and running it.
        So the animation can be run on a timer that switches on and off at
      times of our choice, and saving power at other times.
