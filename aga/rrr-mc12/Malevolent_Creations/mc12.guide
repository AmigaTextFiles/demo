    We take absolutely no responsibility whatever the buttons below may
      cause to your health, sanity, little niece or something else. 
    If you are not interested in your life as it is now, just go ahead.
                    You will never be the same. Never.

 The criminal masterplan is finally working out as megatons of wasted
 earthlings unknowingly donate their wits to the devious forces of 
 the Un-Dead mastering the DiscoTeqhue-phenomena. On every dance floor 
 a Phantom lurks, absorbing the energies and processing capabilities 
 of the dancers, which are held in BrainDead() subroutine meanwhile.
 And as the seconds rot away the Dominion of the Dead grows stronger...

 "A bright light leads you to heaven, your soul cursed to eternal
 damnation. Your spirit set free now wanders, your body buried
 rots in the ground..." - Blaine Cook 

 The ancient poet erred only a bit, for he was not aware of the true 
 nature of the human components, their bidding to the Planes of Void 
 and Matter, the ultimate reason why humans will never truly Ascend. 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Have an Ice Day " system "data/0a.dat data/123.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Gamma Scorpii 5-C, your place for a Sub Zero holiday. But never try to 
 reach the Sacred Site of the Cold Cubes, for they are guarded not only 
 by the chilling wraiths using unbelievable -35K body temperature, 
 but by the Viking TorBjorn himself, son of Olof, descending directly 
 from the family of Growing Pains.

 Although displaying the Balance, the viewer may notice the absence 
 of light and the Creatures of the Night lurking here and there, while
 goodwill is nowhere to be seen. Let it now be revealed that Balance
 doesn't exactly need the opposing forces to be Equal in every way. 
 The multiverse as we know it, created Neutral Evil of alignment, was 
 constructed in a way that only a small amount of Good is necessary to 
 keep the necessary supply of Innocent Victims available for the 
 purposes of much larger Hordes of Evil paraThings.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Temporal Mismatch " system "data/0a.dat data/125.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Our DM-303 which produces more than it takes is a dream of every
 engineer on uncivilized worlds. Due to the mental inadequacy and 
 religious stubborness, this Life/Matter Enhancer remains out of 
 market for several sectors. Here at VooDooCon(TM) we feel that
 Research and Development is the key to success, and certains actions
 will be taken shortly to insure the market for our high class Device. 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Utopian Kiertoajelu " system "data/0a.dat data/126.dat blank reltime 8"}

 Once upon a time, our beautiful and beloved Utopia was a paradise
 for eccentrics and science fiction geeks like us. Then it became
 popular, and tourist hordes raped it, just like the Hegemony raped
 Maiu-Covenant. These stories have been told before in previous episodes. 

 But the savagery couldn't go on for ever, and the Time of Cleansing
 finally came. Using selective orbital bombardment the human tourists 
 were scorched to ash and their leftovers were Farcast to whence they 
 came. Needless to say, Utopia is now restored to its former glory.
