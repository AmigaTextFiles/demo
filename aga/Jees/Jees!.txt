                               >>>> JeeS! <<<<
			



	This is Mellow Chips' contribution to Demolition demo competition,
	held in Joensuu, Finland, 26th-28th April 1996.



	Requirements

	o AGA chipset
	o 1.5mb of harddisk space
	o CPU 68020+
	o mathtrans system library



	Installation

	Copy all files to destination directory in your harddisk.
	No assigns are needed, just type 'Jees!' to run the demo.
	If you have problems, try to run it without startup
	sequence. 



	Notes

	Sorry if you don't have at least 68030. 

	Though this demo works even on a plain A1200 (without any
 	fast mem!), don't expect too much when running the demo on
	one because the chunky2planar code is optimized for fast
	mem system... 



	Special Hellos to:

	Chris Hodges, Semprini, Rick Five!, Martin Wehrens and all
 	cool dudes on internet who know me!
