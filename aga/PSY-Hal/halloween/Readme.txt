                      Prophesy - Halloween demo 
                          "TRICK OR TREAT"


How to run:

The demos will look for a path like so:  dh1:demos/halloween 

Make sure you copy the halloween directory and its contents to a dir on
dh1: called "demos" or maybe you can make some assigns if it will work for
you. Then cd into the Halloween dir and type Trickortreat.exe and all
should work accordingly. If not just mess around, it`s 10.00 halloween so I
don`t have much time to mess about i want this anim released now!! 


The idea behind this animation is to create a little bit of mindless 
entertainment for fellow amiga users. It would be nice to see more fun 
productions by groups instead of mathematical programming tricks and Im sure 
we are all capable of tacky demos like this one so why not do it.

I should get the mail forwarded to me. Please allow delays for my reply 
cos I don`t have my own net connection or email address. 




The making of this demo:
                     
The graphics and animation were made a few weeks ago while I was sitting at 
home watching the nights drawing in. Once the graphics were complete I
spent all night browsing through my CD and movie collection looking for
samples.. I even played the screams down the phone at 12.30 pm to an 
unexpecting friend.. well he was my friend until I did this. Some of the
sfx are really bad especially the Trick or Treat mister speech sample but I
couldn`t find a microphone so i had to take it from a halloween series of
Bottom. Finally the demo was compiled together and finished on a cold,
dark, hallowed evening. Now the work is done I`m just typing up this little 
comentry to go with it as a street lamp is shining directly into my unlit 
room. Across the road and I can see directly into a neighbours house... I`ll
just have a look at what they are doing... it looks like they are watching 
me.. erm..frightening.... erm.. i`ll just close my curtains.......thats 
better. Well I think i`m going to lha this demo ready to release and end the 
night watching a movie (No school tommorrow! yippee). I`ll see you in the 
next PSY release..(probably our Christmas animation) bye bye...

Happy Halloween!!! Don`t have nightmares!!
