»» Piece Of Mind HD-Loader made by Zer0-X! ««

Here's what you are going to need to watch this OLD demo from HardDisk:

- Any Amiga(!)
- ½-2Mb Chip / ½-1Mb Fast
- Harddrive

I think everyone should have these nowadays!


Use the install-script provided to copy your disk to HardDisk!

ATTN!: This1 runs too fast at anything faster than A500...!
