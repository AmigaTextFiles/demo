    Just a little note: we rellay plaaned to do it much faster, we had 
    terrible delays by a reason of summer time, you know summer - is a
     fun time:). So finally we a bit sucked with introduction of this 
     intro - all pictures are shown too fast and not in the way how it
      was planned! Due to I (GDM) could not reach coder to fix it and
    recode intro part and due to deadline we released it in such way :)
      Sorry, but remember this is just a bbs intro and just a little
     present for my friend Zinko, release for fun and not for status!
  So please take care and stay tuned for soon coming invitation intro to
       Enlight'96 coded by Juggler and with music from Neurodancer.


                         release date: 10'JULY'F96
