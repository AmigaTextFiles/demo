Oxyron presents you "XIII", the 2nd Place of the Amiga-Demo-competition
at THE PARTY 98.
This is (hopefully) the final Version, ofcoz the party-release was a little bit
buggy.

Changes to the Party-Release:

  - fixed some Memory-Leaks, which could cause your Amiga to crash
  - reduced the amount of needed Memory, now it runs with ca. 7.5MB free Fastram
  - the GUI now remembers your last settings, same for the PIP-Window
  - fixed some minor bugs in some Effects

System requirements:
  -minimum: 68030, 68881, 8 MB FastRam, AGA or Gfx-Board
	    with AGA you need around 1.3 MB free ChipRam
	    with GfX-Board 300k free Chip should be enough

  -recommended: 68040 and AGA or ZorroIII-GfX-Board ( ZorroII is sooo slow :-\ )

  -best viewed with 68060 and PicassoIV with PiP-Window on Wb >:o)

Some technical Notes:

  If you use "autodetect" in the GUI, the Demos is searching for the needed Graphics-
  Hardware. If AGA is found, then AGA will be used ! Graphicboard-support is just a
  fallback-mode ( except PiP ) for Users with older non-AGA-Amigas or Guys without
  RGB-Monitor or Flickerfixer.

  For Graphicsboard-Usage, you need a Screenmode 320x240 in 8 bit and 16bit ! We can't
  guarantee, that anything goes right without such screenmode !

  If you have a ZorroIII-gfxboard, than check "Screensync". This enables smoother
  Doublebuffering. It also slows down a little bit, but with ZorroIII this isn't sooo
  much.
  ZorroII-Users should NOT check "Screensync", unless it looks too ugly without this.
  But they should try "Halflines", this should be a speed up in the HiColor-Parts.

  PIV-Users have a special toy - the "PiP"-switch in the Video-selector. Try it ! It
  looks incredible, a demo in a scalable Window on the Wb. And please, show this some
  PC-users ;)

  Sound is played back via the Paula, so there is no chance to show this Demo on a
  Draco or any other AmigaOS-compatible System without real Amiga-Hardware. Probably
  our next Demo will use Ahi...

  And finally, if you see the Demo on your super-duper-gfx-board, and some things like
  Screenmodeswitches and so one are looking ugly, remember: this Demo is designed for
  AGA !

						  Enjoy XIII !
