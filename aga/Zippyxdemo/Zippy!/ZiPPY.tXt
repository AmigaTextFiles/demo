 The ZiPPY-X-DEMo
 ----------------
 ___
  | his is  a rather funky demo  created by Gareth Murfin. It has all the
 usual  demo  material, ie,  spinning polygons  and  cool  music. However
 this one is different,  different in a  way no one can explain. It seems
 more  professional, maybe its more film - like than the rest, who knows?
 It also uses  Say  to speak  out the intro text and installs say for you
 at the same time. So  its a rather brilliant demo which is worth showing
 to your friends whose eyes are straying to the PC sections in ViRGiN. ;)
 Also included is a klingon.accent which you can rename as american.acent
 so that you have klingon speech instead Of ordinary voice. This will not
 change  the  demo  though,  as  it  is  programmed  to be the usual say.
 PS. LøøK out for the dancing cube who strutts to the beat. 0k EnJoY! ;«)

 INTRø - Copy®ights and Laws
 -----

 The first thing I'd like to say is  that all the things contained in this
 demo either belong to me or have been allowed for use by me by the author
 Ive learned my lesson since the last time I produced an 8 meg utility and
 then found out that all the Homer Simpson sounds belonged to BskyB :(. So
 this time I have gained the express  permission of the authors of all the
 sounds used. For  details of this permission please  email  me and I will
 provide you with proof - ginkmobile@geocities.com.  I would  also like to
 say that ALL the demo was created  by me apart from the sounds which have
 already been accounted for. Any other programs used ie, the excellent Vt,
 Player, Play16 are all shareWare and available freely From the AmiNet.Gaz

 *Additional*  - Only the sounds were not made by me, they were downloaded
 from  "The Aga Experience Vol 1" . In  this  CD  it  clearly  states that
 "All  Material  contained  within this  CD is freely distributable to the
 public, apart from selective Pd programs"  - [I have used none of those!]

 HøW? - I suppose you programmed this in C++ then?
 ----

 Er...Nope! This demo is created entirely in AmigaDOS programming and the
 reason for this is because quite  simply Im not a "Real" programmer just
 yet ;)  Although I believe I did a very  good  job on |DWaRFx| the AreXX
 scripts available for AmIRC ;P  The Animations were created and rendered
 using CiNEMA4dII and a combination of Dpaint IV AGA & Ppaint 7.0.  Sound
 samples were obtained using a 16bit SoundSampler and Turbo® software.

 WhY? - What for Gaz?
 ----

 I wanted to get into the DEmOSCeNe and I knew the only way was to make a
 demo, so basically I sat down and made this. I think its nice but if you
 dont agree, then Im sorry to have wasted your time ;) I really want this
 to be published on the Best Amiga CD-ROM  in the world because I want to
 have my demo imortalised for all time!And so I can wipe the bloody thing
 off my hard drive! ;) hehe.I would like to be able to mention that I had
 a demo published on my entry form for UniVersity soon,it would hopefully
 help me get onto a computing  course and devise the ultimate OS for  the
 new A\BOx :).

 eXitiNg -How The HeLL Dø I End it?
 -------

 It is  suggested  that you simply reboot your Amiga,  or spend about two
 minutes  admiring  the random star scrolling and then reboot. However if
 you  really, really dont  want to  reboot (maybe you've got something in
 RaM: which you dont want to lose!) then at  the end of the demo when the
 stars are scrolling by, do this :-

 · Click left mouse button
 · load up a Shell (the stars keep coming back every sec you leave the
                    keyboard idle, so you'll have to keep moving!! ß-)
 · Type  Zippy:Zippybits/Player    & push return
 · close the window which appears
 · then type Zippy:Zippybits/STaRblank and on the pull down menus select
   quit on window
 · There youve done it, now you can reload the demo!!

 Ill just tell you something cool before I finish. I am now using a Windows95
 keyboard with my A1200T  and my old A1200 shell with keyboard etc is mounted
 on my bedroom wall in a sort of diagnol arty way. I think it looks fantastic
 and I advise anyone making a tower to do the same and not destoy the shell!!
 It looks  so cool  and shows  everyone  that  you regard the Amiga to be the
 amazing machine it is. Right, hehe now that Ive said that I can go! ;) Gaz97
