 We are hereby Proud to Boldly Present you the
 
 === First Cocoon * Amiga Demo ever ===

  For the 20th Birthday of Cocoon !

 It's Called - Catabasis -

 It's about going down to Hell...
 ...and coming back.

 Note for the demo competition show:
 the end of the demo occurs after the punchline
 is displayed bellow the last cocoon logo.
 ( some 4/5 seconds after the logo appears.)

 It can be HardDisk installable or even floppy
 bootable, you just have to copy:
  -Catabasis.exe
  -Catabasis.exe.info
   (A good Amiga demo should have a dedicated icon.)
  -Catabasis.dat
  aside, and run Catabasis.exe, fron dos or icon.



 an .adf/.dms floppy version may follow, and
 a full source package may follow also.

 You may notice it runs on naked non-accelerated
 AGA Amigas (Amiga 1200, Amiga 4000), but should
 be fine with any accelerator
This demo is also highly suspected to work on CD32.
 (tested on A1200/020 and A4000/060).
 AGA COPPERLISTS RULZ.
