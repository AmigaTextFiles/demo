VIDEO MELIORA PROBOQUE, DETERIORA SEQUOR
-----------------------------------------


info:
-----
this version is slightly different from the party version. low-end version is
also included.


requirements:
-------------
- amiga + aga or cgx,
- xpk, asyncio, mpega libraries,
- ahi,
- the best cpu (m68k only) you can find,
- general knowledge about the scene.



low-end version:
----------------
as the video meliora is very cpu-hungry we decided to make special version
for processors different than 060. this low-end version is scaled down, has
worse film quality and lacks some features like english subtitles. in this
version you have more screen modes to select (i can recomend you
super72:200x150, or extra low-res modes - they look pretty ugly). if higher
resolution was selected the screen will be (hopefully) centered. centering
is disabled in cgx modes because i (noster) don't know if it supports
horizontal screen movement.



ppc (polska platforma cyfrowa):
-------------------------------
video meliora doesn't work on these nasty PowerUP boards. to watch the demo
please turn it off somehow (party crew did it without board removal).
as i (noster) do not have ppc, i can't fix it. i think the problem could be
with creating new dos process or message port. if anyone know sth more about
it please contact me.



thank you's:
