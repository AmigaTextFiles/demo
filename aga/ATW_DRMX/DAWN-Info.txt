When the first version of DAWN was released, it was a mere  4k
intro  means:  Coding,  coding, coding. It was splendid and we
got rewarded for it by the first place at THE PARTY V.

Yet, there have  also  been  voices  trying  to  nagg  at  the
quality.  Suddenly  DAWN was boring, no music, no gfx. Just an
ego-boasting.

Worst of all, however, were the people saying  that  DAWN  was
nothing but a failed attempt to do this kind of effect. Means:
Artwork has just released DAWN in 4k as we  knew  the  effects
would have no chance at a 40k-competition.

                Uh-oh, what a mistake, mates.


           So, here you are. DAWN.remix the title.
                A 40k intro with all respects.


Routines are improved and music you also get -  You  demanded,
we  remixed.  To  all  still  demanding: Especially for you we
added a 1*1 Pixel version of the original DAWN; as bonus. Just
to please you.


              Let's wait for the second round...
