Demo is upbuilded version and brand new production.
First demo screen and few first events linked with the cube are identical
with previously released "Not Yet Phonk" intro. Year ago on Revision 2022.
Also remixed shade-bobs from Glootokisshell are here.
Even though Phonk! is new demo that takes off where the intro left.
It develops for further 8 screens ahead, up to 4m20s. So...

    -->> KEEP ON WATCHING!!! <<--  -->> KEEP ON WATCHING!!! <<--

It hasn't been published either yet, except for some cube parts of the first scene.
And even that only as a camcorder screengrab on my YouTube channel - .exe is a brand
new stuff!!!


T E R M I N A T I O N :

Demo can be interrupted at any moment with LMB, RMB or Esc.
Interruption trigger time is about 500ms at some moments,

If you believe that private hobbyist-coder know how to:
  - crack
  - hack
  - destroy your computer
  - invigilate your data
  - read what's behind someones' on a photographs
  - still your:
    - credit card details
    - savings
    - passwords
    - lists of contacts
    - selfies
    - addresses
  - control traffic, buses, trams, tube and trains
  - control your mind (cybertelepathy)
  - control wallstreet, government, t-bet, spaceflights and your e-mails
  - control the eye

then you are delusional and uneducated, even though, or especially because
of that, your fears are taken even more seriously by social service agents.
You have full right to be an idiot, and feel safe even though.
Regardless to what you'll develop. And let the wiseheads work out prooves
for their legal clarity themselves. Even if this way you're breaking lives
of intelligentsia and simply slander or order to lynch and torture.
Not all the folks on earth are having black or white eyes. Not yet.
