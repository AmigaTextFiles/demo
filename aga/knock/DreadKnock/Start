We are curently working on O.J. intro, and a game sporting wonderfull
AGA graphics, it is currently planned as a sort of Myst clone, but not
as serious. We are probably gonna make a demo about Earthdawn, a
roleplaying game by FASA.

You  have probably heard of Black Metal. This song was made as a
tribute to all the Norwegian Black Metal bands whom have arisen
threw these years and all that will come. 

Whel not all, some just suck!

For those who have no idea what Black Metal is:

-Black Metal is hard metal which has currently sported some ochestral
notes. It uses powerfull instruments and tones, percusion being often
asmuch a part of the mellody. Speed and presision is often the 
stile of Black Metal. The hate of the white christ and christians often
are part of the tekst and tone. The artist involved often have powerfull
images, and wear makeup and weaponry (to slaughter christians)!
Norway has lately been sort of the founder of Black Metal, setting the 
stile and most of the artists.
