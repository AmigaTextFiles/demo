WiLD SuMMeR
-----------

an animation show by WK-Artworks and Infect.

This demo was made & released at the Summer Party 96 in Denmark.
We planned to release DataWorld II there, but due to some unforeseen problems
with the competitions (the organizers were not able to pay the announced prize
money) Eksec decided to retain DataWorld II and release a new demo instead.
He spent some 8 hours at the party to create WiLD SuMMeR using WILDFIRE by
WK-Artworks. Finally this hastyly put together demo won the second place.

We decided to overwork the demo completely before releasing it officially.
So here it is:   WiLD SuMMeR FiNaL


Requirements
------------

 -AGA, MC68020, OS V39, 4 MB FASTRAM
 -recommended: MC68030 @ 28MHz (or faster processor), 8 MB FASTRAM


Installation
------------

Extract all archives (IFT-WS#?.lha) to the same path (32 MB space needed).
The directory structure should look like this:

  WiLD_SuMMeR/#?              scripts and text files
    anims/#?                  animations (YAFA format)
    c/YP                      YAFA player
    music/mod.disco_dubs      music (ProTracker module)
    transitions/#?            transition animations (YAFA format)


Running WiLD SuMMeR
-------------------

We included several script files for different machine configurations:

These are the original scripts, they play most anims @ 25fps.
(requires fast loading, duration: 3 min 40 sec)
 4MB_short: needs about 3.1MB free FASTRAM
 8MB_short: needs about 6.5MB free FASTRAM (more load buffers)

These scripts play the anims @ 16.6fps, useful when loading from slower media.
(duration: 7 min 20 sec, music plays twice, some anims loop several times)
 4MB_long: needs about 3.1MB free FASTRAM
 8MB_long: needs about 6.5MB free FASTRAM (more load buffers)

There are some keys you can press while playing:
 ESC, LMB - exit
 N - next animation
 SPACE - pause/continue
 S - sleep
 F1...F10 - set speed

It is of course possible to play single anims using the YAFA player 'YP'.
Use 'yp -h' for the list of options.
