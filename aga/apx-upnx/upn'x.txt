 If  you  have  any  map-rom  routines installed in your system,
please  switch  off  the  power  (then  ofcourse, you'll have to
switch  it  on back to see the demo:), and boot your amy with no
startup before running this demo .

 There're two version of this intro available.  The first one is
the  one  with  well  remaped  textures  (which  was  too big to
contribute  it), and the second one was done only because of the
competition's  rules.   There was a 64kb limit, so the amount of
colours  of the textures had to be a little cut down.  The point
is  that  the  compo  version  looks  a bit worse, so you should
better watch the first one.
