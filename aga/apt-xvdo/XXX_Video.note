I've been told that this demo does not work properly on all configurations.
Sorry about this, but there's nothing _I_ can do about it, since I'm not the
coder.. :)  Btw, the demo requires fastmem.

Remember to support our musicpacks with mods, votes, ads, messys and so on,
and look out for more productions by Apathy...see you at Gathering'97!
