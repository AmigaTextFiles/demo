Here is what you are going to need to hear this disk from HardDisk:

- An Amiga(!)
- ½Mb Chip
- 1.5Mb Fast
- Harddrive

I think everyone should have these nowadays!


Use the install-script provided to copy your disk to HardDisk!


ATTENTION!: I'm not sure about what is the number of this musicdisk, so
            look at the picture "MainScreen.JPG" to see what disk to use!


                                   Again this one is a » o'Moses Release «
