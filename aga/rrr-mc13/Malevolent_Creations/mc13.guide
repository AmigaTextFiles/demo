    We take absolutely no responsibility whatever the buttons below may
      cause to your health, sanity, little niece or something else. 
    If you are not interested in your life as it is now, just go ahead.
                    You will never be the same. Never.

                           YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED


 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Fantasmas Minusculos " system "data/0a.dat data/131.dat blank reltime 5"}

 We start our Malevolent Journey with a pastoral scene, a relaxing
 and peaceful graveyard. Battles have been fought, murders committed,
 brains smashed to pulp and unfaithful husbands and wives have come
 their sad ends. Persons have been sliced to their atomary components
 and their mortal coils now sustenate the slavering bacteria and the
 gnawing worms, while the anguished ghosts float away, like bubbles
 in some fancy and fuzzy beverage.

 And yet there always remains another human with his funny hat
 to feed the eastern crematorium.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Nestehukka " system "data/0a.dat data/132.dat blank reltime 5"}

 This little piece demonstrates the hunting methods of the
 Liquidifying Beast. First the clever beasts hides up in the sky,
 behind some cumulus cloud. When there is a human animal in sight,
 the Liquidifying Beast drops down and tries to look helpless. The 
 predatory instincts of the human animal arise and it tries to
 capture the Liquidifying Beast, but alas, as the human gets close,
 the beast has already transformed itself into highly corrosive
 liquid into which the helpless human prey runs... to be instantly
 melted. After the capture, the modest beast slithers away to
 complete the digesting of his food. After a little nap, our happy
 and hungry Liquidifying Beast is again behind some cloud, waiting
 for more snack to come along...
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Ramayana " system "data/0a.dat data/133.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Ramayana is best watched before reading this description. Afterwards
 the reading will be much more fun as you shake in the joyous
 vibrations of epileptic seizure. But that is not all. If you take
 a closer look at Ramayana and its terrifying size, surely you
 will experience heart attack as well, especially if you understand
 how some nice and pure mathematical formulas were perverted to 
 create a megaconsuming awful monster like this. 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Trois Coleurs - Ensemble " system "data/0a.dat data/134.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Times of armageddon are close. Nor powers of good or the forces of 
 darkness can freeze the Continuum to their liking. The Ankh won't hold 
 up and it won't keep upside down either. Even balance can't hold the
 rule, for the middle state too will change in a single chronometric unit.

 And it is truly nearing the end of it all, because both of the visions
 of the universe coming to its end have happened. The universe has
 stretched to the point where it can no longer hold together, and
 mass has turned to transparent, like plastic turns transparent when
 you stretch it enough. But as you can see, it has also(!) imploded:
 the planets are unnaturally close to each other, and the law of gravity
 will take care of the rest, crashing all mass together, annihilating
 whatever bioconstructions the evulutionary processes have created.

 There is not much else to do for the poor little lifeforms than
 to run around like those headless Oogloblozoogs from Zn'Glotth 3.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Vampire State Building " system "data/0a.dat data/135.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Vampire State Building. It is the very thing all vampires look up to,
 a monument to their greatness, a destination for numerous unholy
 pilgrimages. To suck blood of virgins, to fly around the Vampire State
 Building, what more could a Vampire wish for?

 It is a phallic symbol, a construction of their omnipotency, a physical
 portrait of their endless cattle, a metaphorical body of corpses which
 reaches up to touch the Moon, an awe-inspiring flag for all Suckers to
 unite under. It IS the Vampire State Building.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Varjomaailma " system "data/0a.dat data/136.dat blank reltime 8"}

 Unaware of where they have been, not knowing where they are going,
 the various forms of juicy humans run around their little universe,
 performing what they call their "daily tasks". Of course all their
 operations are in vain, for their fleshy forms will nonetheless fade,
 first into skeletal blasphemies and then further on to only faint
 shadows of what once had been. Not much the alive humans know of the
 reasons for their existence in the Shadow World, a planet occupied
 mostly by their dead kindsmen.

 And that is good. For the energy the meaty humans have is slowly
 absorbed by the watching Master, who looks over them all, like
 a human shepherdess kindly looks over her lambs, her lambs born and
 fed only for the purposes achieved by their final slaughtering.
