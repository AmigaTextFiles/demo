...   so,  today  is the last day of active scening...  i`m dissapointed and
i`m  not  alone.   we,  me and dizzy wanted to make really good party but it
seems  like it is more horrible than we thought.  so, this is some different
words written by azzaro/mwi+emb:

i`m sorry but lahve is talking *BULLSHITS*. this party is really ok and we, 
poles, had a lot of fun while visiting every issue. radek is in depressiive 
mood so that`s the reason [nomen omen] why we definitelly stop writing this 
report. maybe someone will come back here in the future.

now it`s a perfect time to drink some alcohol in the garden, isn`t it...
