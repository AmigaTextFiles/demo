Hey there..... 

OK first up is to say that, I've released this source after
it having been sitting on my Hard Drive for about a year or
more !!!!  IT's release is merely for Educational purposes !

PLEAAAAASEEEEEE  don't FLAME me for bugs in it etc. as it was
my FIRST EVER scene release.. and first ever "big" project 
I coded so bugs/mistakes are inevitable..  I released it because
I thought it could be of some interest to some young coders, still 
learning the trade  :)


     The music replayer is implemented in a less than perfect 
     fashion..  so bugs will rear there heads in that regard..
     I've also heard of reports that 040/(060 ??) owners will 
     have slight gfx corruptions..  I own a A4000/030 and tested
     it on an A1200 and it seemed alright for them..  I am
     not gonna fix any of these as i have no time.. you can
     do it as an excercise :))


The source is compilable for Devpac 3...  so just change the
paths.....   THE Source is ALSO commented Heaps !! so I hope
it's of some use.. :)) 

The Data files are NOT the same as the 1st Release on Aminet..

My CODING Knowledge has improved HEAPS since this release. 

        THIS IS AN ANCIENT RELEASE !!!!

So don't judge me by this !!  This was a release for:

           Devious Designs 1995/6 - Australian Division

COMING FROM FIGURE NINE DESIGN in 1997...


Sick of the SHIT games being produced for the Ami...  where are 
the really great games of years gone by ?????  Well prepare
to be astonished by a game from ex - Devious Boys.. a PLATFORMER
which promises... (and I mean this) really nice hand drawn GFX by
Psyche (Dario Sorbello). and nice CODE by Sultan (Dennis Predovnik) 
and Spirit (Rob Juhuniak)..  

We have REALLY high hopes for this game.. It's very atmospheric
and moody and a preview will be released shortly hopefully of
the same CALIBRE of Superfrog/Ruff'N'Tumble/FLINK.. (We hope :) )
and a WEB sight for FIGURE 9 DESIGN is coming soon also !

All in 100% Asm......  None of this AMOS/BLITZ shit !!!!
