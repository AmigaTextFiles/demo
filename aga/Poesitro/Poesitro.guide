@node Intro
@title "Poesitro - Introduction"

@{b}                               Introduction@{ub}

@{u}Welcome to Poesitro!@{uu}

I (Dep) hope this guide will give you all the answers. If something is
unclear, please @{"contact" link Contact} us!

Let's rip this off in the normal question-wise format:

@{u}What is Poesitro?@{uu}

Poesitro is an interactive production, released with only one intention:

                   - To spread good poetry and texts! -

For your convenience, the lyrics have been splitted into 3 different
cathegories. They are:

· depressive lyrics (dark)
· lyrics in some way connected with love (love)
· miscellaneous lyrics (misc)

The texts are written by both dFX-members and other persons/groups, both in
Swedish and English.
We hope you will like our mixture of lyrics!

(all texts written by members of dFX are copyrighted by them)

@{u}Uhh.. Poetry?@{uu}

Yes! This is a very nice form of art, and if you have never read poetry
before, this is definitely a good time to start!


@{u}So, how do I read it?@{uu}

See the @{"Using Poesitro" link Using} section for info on this.

@node Using
@title "Poesitro - Using Poesitro"

@{b}                              Using Poesitro@{ub}

@{u}The categories@{uu}

When you start Poesitro, you will se a short introduction. Shortly after
this, a picture and a mousepointer will appear on your screen. Clicking on
one of the 4 large sections of the screen (displaying different graphics)
will take you to the category associated with it.

The dFX-choice contains no lyrics, it's a presentation of the group,
with some fun-to-know-things.

To exit, just click the exit-box in the middle of the screen.

@{u}The lyrics@{uu}

Once you have selected a category, your disk will load and unpack the data
associated with that category. This can take some time if you have
a slow system and no fast ram.

You will then be presented a list of the texts available for this category.
Use the arrow keys to choose the text you want to read, then press return.
This will put you in @{b}Readmode@{ub}.

To return to the categories-screen, just select the "Return To Main"-entry
or press Escape.

@{u}Readmode@{uu}

In readmode the arrow keys are used to scroll texts which are bigger than
the screen.
To return to the list of texts, press return.
