»» Sound Vision HD-Loader made by Zer0-X! ««

Here's what you are going to need to view this neat oldy from HardDisk:

- Any Amiga(!)
- ½-1Mb Chip
- 1½Mb Fast
- Harddrive

I think everyone should have these nowadays!


Use the install-script provided to copy your disk to HardDisk!

ATTN!: Think this one too runs a bit too fast?

At the moment my loaders can also be found from Funet: » FTP.FUNET.FI «
