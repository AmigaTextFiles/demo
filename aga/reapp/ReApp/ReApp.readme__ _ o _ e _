иииии Background


            Put together for the ACG Hack IV in Umeт, Sweden, eastern 97.

           We never thought we would have time to do it properly but we

           couldn't let a democompetition in our close neighborhood just

           pass by without giving it a shot. So we did, and this is it.

           Our first demo on the Amiga ever, more of a test-drive of our
               »»»»»
           DemoLib and 3d-engine. We don't like it that much.

            We didn't release it right after the Hack because of some bugs

           we wanted to fix. Since the competition was virtually none at

           the Hack and the AmiTech-expo was upcoming we decided to fine-

           tune our demo in order to compete in the AmiTech-democompetition

           aswell with this revision 2.0 of ReAppearance.

иииии Known bugs

           No Enforcer-hits and successfully tested on A4000/030/040/060
           and A1200/020/030, but...

           * DemoLib resourcetracking does not work 100%, especially not if
             an memory allocation error occurred in the middle of the demo.

           * Productivity screenmodes do not work 100%, I'll have to look
             at Fabio Bizzettis source again.
