                       2nd in 64k Intro Competition

              Brought to you by Venus Art at Gravity Party II
                      30-31 August 1997 Opole Poland

 Once  again  we  have  prepared something really outstanding for the 65536
bytes   intro  competition.   As  always  this  production  is  running  in
multitasking, with full CyberGraphX support.
The CyberGraphX mode should now run a little bit faster cos' now the bitmaps
are placed in fast mem , not in chip mem like in 'Grotesque!'.
(blame me, I'm an idiot;-)

This is the fixed version of Oubliette. Th version that was spread at the
party, doesn't worked with CyberGraphX. I've tested it and now there should
be no more problems.There is still no doublebuffering in CyberGraphX mode.
I'dont have graphics board right now and i'm unable to add this feature.

 (when you run the intro with FPS parammeter you will get informations
about current frame rate - 'Oubliette.executable FPS')

 - Who Made What???

	- Programming & 3D technology : NOE & BJSebo
	- Music:		      : Wierza / Venture (thanx a lot)
	- 3D Objects & Design         : BJSebo

	- I would also like to thanks Pippen / Venture for hardware support
	  (Now I'm sure that 68060 is better then 68020 ;-)

 - Hmmm... Some requirements???
	- Motorola 68020
        - 8Mb of fast ram
	- AGA  (it  is possible to watch the intro on non AGA machines,but
		you should have graphics board running under CyberGraphX)

 - Hmmm nr 2 Some recommended hardware
	- MC 68040 40Mhz (at least - intro was done on '060 and shows his best
			  on such a machine)
	- Graphics board running under CyberGraphX.

 - We have made some tests:

      - A1200 14Mhz 8Mb  AGA            (Arrrggggh - don't try this at home)
      - A1230 40Mhz 8Mb  AGA            (nice?)
      - A1240 40Mhz 16Mb ZorroII CV643D (hmmm... Zorro II sucks...)
      - A1260 66Mhz 32Mb AGA            (thats what I call pleasure)
      - A4060 50Mhz 72Mb ZorroIII CV64  (ROCK IT BABE!!!)

 - Have we used some software???
	- SasC development package v6.57
	- Devpac Assembler v3.11
	- PicCon v2.20
	- PPaint v7.0
	- Vertex v2.0
	- LightWave v3.5
	- Virtua Art 3D Library v0.9
