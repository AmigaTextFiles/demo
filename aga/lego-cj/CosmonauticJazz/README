Finally!  It's there:  the demo which has been announced for four years
took part in the Mekka & Symposium 1998 demo competition and made a
breath-taking seventh place!  Is the scene not yet ready for this?  Decide
for yourself and download the final release.

The party demo version has, to my astonishment, not showed up on the
Internet, though it has been uploaded to the party FTP server on Monday
(quite late, though).  But this is okay, since both the end part and the
hidden part were missing in that version.  Here we go, have fun!

This demo runs in full multitasking, but takes over the AGA graphics
hardware.  If any of you know a ProTracker replayer that does *not* throw
enforcer hits and is able to run in multitasking (I'm using The
Buggy^H^H^H^H^HPlayer 6.1A), please let me know.
