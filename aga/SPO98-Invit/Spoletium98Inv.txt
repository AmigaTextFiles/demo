                14-15 March 1998 - Spoleto (PG) - Italy

             officially supported by the Comune di Spoleto

.INTRODUCTION.

After coding hundreds of productions in a short time, after releasing the
official Scene chart, after trying always to improve themselves, DARKAGE is
proud to announce you a new party, for Amiga only: the SPOLETIUM 1998!
Only Amiga and C64 users are welcome! And, most important, the entrance is
FREE! BUT, we understand it can be hard for you to reach the partyplace, so you
can compete also if you send your contributions by email! You'll get your prize
by post. Otherwise, if you want to came here, we have provided for you 10 FREE
rooms in a beautiful small hotel near the partyplace, from 15th to 16th March.
So you can sleep before travelling back to your home in a soft hot bed. ;)

.WHEN and WHERE.

The party'll be in Spoleto, a beautiful town in the middle Italy, easy to reach
by car, train and airplane. The party will start in 14th March and it'll end
the 15th morning. Partyplace is in the "Nuovo Palazzetto dello Sport" (new
sport center), located in Piazza d'Armi. Just ask some inhabitants for it!

.HOW TO COME.

TRAIN:
First of all, Spoleto is a major station, so every train passing in, will stop.
You just need a train on his railway, consider that Spoleto is half the way
between Foligno and Orte.
From Rome, trains to Ancona, Foligno, Florence via Orte (in this case you need
to change in Orte for trains heading to Foligno/Ancona).
From Florence, trains to Orte, Rome via Orte, to Foligno (in this case you have
to change in Foligno for trains heading to Orte/Rome), last but no least avoid
path in wich you should change in Terontola, it is a God forgotten station! :-)
From Ancona, trains to Rome or to Foligno then change for Orte/Rome.
CAR:
From Rome, A1 Rome-Florence then exit at Orte and there follow Flaminia till
Spoleto.
From Ancona, head for Rome (not by highway) Spoleto it's on the way.
From Florence go by Valdichiana then once reached Perugia follow signs for
Foligno/Spoleto.
AIRPLANE:
From Fiumicino, take a trains to Rome Termini (there is one every hour), then
follow as written in the TRAIN section.

.RULES.

italian laws: drugs and alchools *should* be forbidden, if party organizers
will find them :) Piracy is also prohibited but this is REALLY not welcome,
