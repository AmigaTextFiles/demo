                                 PRESENT:

                                  AYRTON

REQUIREMENTS:
020+, AGA, NTSC/PAL monitor or tv, about 1.2Mb of FAST and 1.2Mb of CHIP

Note: I have tested the demo only on a 030, so if on 020 the passing between
the Ayrton's photos during the demo is too slow, please report me.



USAGE:
You can type the following letters after the executable name to obtain the
slideshow text in many languages

e   for English text (default)
i   for Italian text
d   for German text

Example:
Ayrton.exe i (to obtain the Italian text)



Well, what can I say? Ayrton is only a small slideshow dedicated to Ayrton
Senna, poor code but I think there is a great music. You can find the original
song into the cd called "CANZONI" by Lucio Dalla (one of the best Italian
singer). I have made this slideshow only now because it was quite impossible
find a musician which still use the ProTracker (yes, even if I know that it's
an hard job make a conversion of a "real song"). But fortunately, after "many
years" of search, I have found Richard that made a Great Conversion!



Greetings:
Richard Kapp for the Great Module
Mase for his help and his unshakeable patience in these years
Rocketeer, Flender, Posdnuos and all the "Spooky Fellow" members
Adrian, I still love Spectrum games :-)
