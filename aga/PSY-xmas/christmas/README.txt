To run from harddrive just cd into the dir and type xmasdemo.exe - simple
eh?

Info`s about this prod
----------------------
This (very surreal) anim was started in the dark winter nights of 1993, it 
was originally intended as a section of the Prophesy christmas megademo, 
but was never coded. It`s extremely short, but 1mb is very limiting when
making animations.
