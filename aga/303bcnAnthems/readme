303bcn Anthems

303bcn - is a small demoscene and mm group that has the spirit of electronic music, 
retro computers and the love / hate feeling of the square blocks of Bcn.

Since 2010 to 2018, 303bcn were active in the local chipmusic scene in 
Barcelona. They played live several times using Amigas on the stage. 2x 
amiga 1200 for music using AHX tracker, and one Amiga 1200 running AmiVjing 
for visuals.

From parties in okupa houses, to electronic music and international chipmusic 
festivals in Barcelona, neuroflip + mvac7 developed their own hard style to bring the 
Amigas to the dance floor. mvac7 coded his own VJing system on amiga, capable of show, 
move and deform sprites and backgrounds in several ways.

303bcn Anthems - is not the classic chiptune musicdisk, this is some of the punk material 
they used to use, modify and mix in live. More tracks were created for the project, but 
this ones were not released before in the original AHX format. Experimental and glitching 
AHX modules that OBSOLETE compiles for you in a super nice AGA musicdisk.

All the tracks are written at same or equivalent speed (F02, F04, F08, ...), so tracks 
can be synced live with no problem at all, using two different amigas. The sync can be 
corrected using arrow keys in track editor while playing the mod, and the instruments 
can be edited while playing, modifying the filter, modulation or any other values.

Thanks to mvac7/303bcn for all the effort and all the hard work he did for the project
Thanks to Skynet/OBSOLETE for fight hard against the AHX replayer routines
Thanks to TecniMan for the shiny icons
Thanks to the Lowtoy netlabel for all the people and party time

And Thanks to all the people involved in some or other way in this and all the 303bcn projects.
