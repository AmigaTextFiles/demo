My big friend Ghandy asked me to code a small trailer intro for the new issue
of my preferred diskmag, and ofcourse I accepted. After 2 days of work, this's
the result. Sadly, this intro is 99% finished, but it never will, because I
lost its sources in a hd crash. So, enjoy this and take it as a preview - there
may be bugs, non-syncronisms, imprecisions. I hope you'll like a lot the mag :)
