@Node 2 "Editorial note??"

So what the hell is this!?
E.R.S.98 has been quite dormant latly one would say!
Not that we have done so extremly much before! hehe!
This "demo" marks the last of the 'classic' E.R.S.98 releases!

This 'thing' here has gone trew a hole lot of shit! It was originaly
meaning to be 'the O.J. intro'! But hey, that never happened! O.J. left
E.R.S.98 before he even got to do any damage! That is to E.R.S.98! Damage
he did, but thats another story...
So we desided, or rather I desided that I should release it as: 'the O.J.
Extro' Guess what!? That never happened. I have been working hard latly
with a jobb, which I have quit now! And have latly been doing a loth of
work with my musik projekt! Which is doing nicly I would say!!!
But E.R.S.98 is kinda back to buisines! But we are going trew quite a
revamp! As I sead earlier. The stile of E.R.S.98 will change rather to
the bether! And we will have more solid members. You can get the whole
'scope' of whats going on in E.R.S.98 in the next edidtion of our diskmag:
'The Cracked Regular'! Which will be TCR ed.2!!! Soon to come! I hope!

So here we are again. This demo is just quickly put together material! Done
in a day or so!! I realised I had to get it out in one form or another!
Much of the old material of E.R.S.98 is quite crap! And has to do with the
fact that the most of the members of E.R.S.98 are crap! But that is to
change! E.R.S.98 will not be a typical demo group in the future!!!
Just you wait and se... And do remeber to read the next TCR!!!

If you feel like Voting for demogroup around in the Amiga scene, please
feel free to fill out our @{Votesheet system "run >nil: ed Vote"} and your votes and names will be
included in the next ed!

Se you lather...
Sorg! The head of E.R.S.98 :)

@Node 3 "E.R.S.98!?"

Here is some unupdated info on E.R.S.98!
Read the next ed.(2) of 'The Cracked Regular' to et your hand on the
breathtaking info about E.R.S.98's big revamp!!

Current members.. sort of:

Sorg:
The head.. To one who does all the work!!

Spanky Girl...:
Crap!!! But has a 'nice' atitude.

Mausoleum:
Means well, but lazy as hell!!

Viking E-dude:
Who the hell is this guy!!?? Is he still going to be a member??

O.J.:
Well.. he is not a member any more..

XXXXX:
???? There is secret member of E.R.S.98!!! To be reviled in the next ed. of
'TCR'!!!

E.R.S.98 has released a whole lot of stuff which you can find on Aminet!
Some of it is quite nice!!! BIG NOTE!!
Some people have been craping on us becouse our icons look strange!!
When I made the original icons for E.R.S.98, I made them using the standard
WorkBench 256 colour palette!!! So that is probably your problem! We will
be using newicons in the future!! And in this release!!!

If you want a full releaselist. Download one of our never demoes, or 'The
Cracked Regular' ed.1! Or e.mail E.R.S.98!

@Node 6 "NOTE!!"

Note:

This thing here was quickly cramed together and stuffed on the net!
And has quite some errors.. Espesialy spelling ones!! hehe!
So don't come to me complaining!!!
--Belive me: I KNOW!!!!--

The song that is included is made by Sorg.
And if you have problems hearing it! Turn up the volume! It tends to
help...
And that song.. And this demo was supposed to be a personal dedication to
O.J. by Sorg!!! And it still is, sort of!!
