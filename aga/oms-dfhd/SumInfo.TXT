»» Desert Dream HD-Loader (fixed) made by Zer0-X! ««

Here is what you are going to need to watch this nice demo from HardDisk:

- An Amiga(!)
- ½Mb Chip
- 2.5Mb Fast
- Harddrive

I think everyone should have these nowadays!


Use the install-script provided to copy your disks to HardDisk!


ATTENTION!: When running this demo from memory the Kefrens logo in the
    beginning isn't visible & some vectors bug too in the start
»» Fixed to start from the Workbench now !!! ««

                                   Again this one is a » o'Moses Release «
