Yes, this is a demo from Ram Jam. Taste the difference.
It was supposed to partecipate at ASM96, but was not accepted, also if we
followed the rules. So we dediced to release it off parties... we don't care
about winning or taking money, we care other things.
To generate the executable, please use the "join" command from the standard
workbench:

	join rj-mkc.1 rj-mkc.2 to rj-mkc.exe
	delete rj-mkc.1
	delete rj-mkc.2

Now you have to execute rj-mkc.exe.
The best way is to make a clean boot without startup, load SETPATCH and
then the demo. I have to greet Vega/RJ for 030 testing and Modem/X-zone for
060 testing. Now the demo seems to work on 020/030/040/060.

Note from Randy: this is my last demo for Amiga, so I made it great.
I don't leave the Amiga only because is dead in the market: demos are
not commercial products, so who care about the commercial situation of
computers... C64 coders rule also in 1996!
I leave because most of my old scene friends leaved the scene one after
another to make a family, to work, to study (really), to be lazy, to play some
playstation or ultra 64 games, or to join PC scene.
Since I am in the scene for the friends, and not for the computers, I follow
my friends, so probably I will organise Ram Jam PC section, without coding
too much, since I hate 80x86 asm.
Ram Jam Amiga will live forever, because others will remain and some coders
will join to replace me. The life continues...
Coders and gfx artists that wants to work also for PC, but like other
people that enjoyed Amiga scene, can contact me and evenctually join
Ram Jam PC.... we hate those PC people that thinks Amiga is shit, and we
can't join them, hehe. Ex-amigans will rule PC scene: last parties was won
by ex-amiga people: Ra and Moby worked at the Noon demos, CNCD won the
PC democompo of the Gathering 96 with "Inside", Contrast/Oxigene won the
Saturne 96 PC compo, and in the future ex-amigans will dominate PC scene.
Well, who care if C64 died.. who care if Amiga will die.. also PC will die
one day, and his successor will die also. Friendship and art are hard to die.

Here the text from the final scroller. Sorry if someone is not in the hellos
list, I can't remember all the people I've meet in the scene!
