 this tiny prog is some kind of a 'sampling oscilloscope'. it uses
 the parallel port sampler, if you don't have one, then this prog
 will be useless for you. it also requires an AGA machine.

 (i tested my prog with a friend's sampler and: it didn't work!
 it seems the sampler waits for some initializing or what, i don't know.
 my sampler is a 'MasterSound' (C) 1990 microdeal. today it is sold
 as 'MegaloSound'. it contains only an ADC and a few little parts...)

 the sampling rate is 16kHz so frequencies above 8kHz will not be
 visible. if you say now 'this is not very much' then i wanna tell you:
 16kHz means that during every pal-frame we receive 320 bytes so it fits
 perfectly on a lores screen. and there's simply not enough cpu power
 on todays amigas to use a higher resolution for this task. (i think ;-)

 the prog is controlled via keyboard so try these:

 --DISPLAY MODES--
  F1 - lores 20ms (1 frame)
  F2 - hires 40ms (2 frames)

 --PLOTTING MODES--
  F3 - single dot
  F4 - eight average dots
  F5 - line
  F6 - solid
  F7 - spectrum analyzer

 --OTHER CONTROLS--
  F9 - show unused processor time
  F10- freeze display
  ESC- exit


 ABOUT CPU TIME

 the dotted modes (F3+F4) run even on an unaccelerated A1200 in one frame.
 some Fast RAM and a powerful processor make it possible to run also the
 other modes in one frame although this depends very much on the sample.
 if the plotting routine needs too much time screen borders will flash red.
 you should select a different mode then.
 holding down F9 makes the usage of processor time visible. the coloured
 part of the screen shows idle time, the part above with normal colors is
 needed to plot the scope. green color means the routine got ready within
 the first frame. in 2-frames-mode there can appear some blue color which
 shows the routine needed the whole first frame and got ready in the second.


 ABOUT THE SPECTRUM ANALYZER:

 it uses a 128-point fast fourier transformation. each bar is about 125Hz
 wide and represents the level of this frequency band. the frequency range
 goes from about 125Hz at the left side to about 8kHz at the right side.

 the spectrum analyzer always scans only 256 bytes of the sample,
 this is due to the fft loop, sorry! if your machine is fast enough you
 should run it on 20ms display, so you 'miss' only 64 bytes each frame
 which is 20% of the whole sample. on 40ms display your chances to miss
 short impulses (such as hihats etc.) are 60%...
 i don't know how to fix the problem of these 'time gaps' without coding
 a new fft loop from scratch! (and this is hard work! :^)



 and remember: this is only a programming experiment. you can't claim
 me for any damages or trouble my prog could cause. it's all your
 fault coz you dared to start it ;-)

 HISTORY

 170195
  -first release

 190195
  -FFT spectrum analyzer implemented
    NOTE: in this first version there are some 'inaccuracies' in the
    frequency range. i will fix it as soon as i get some equipment to
    calibrate the frequencies. and maybe i'll implement 'acoustic scaling'
    which linearizes the spectrum like the human ear does.

 200195
  -spectrum analyzer calibrated (using Masque's Chicken Dialer!!)
  -peak levels implemented

 240195
  -code optimizing
  -fixed a serious bug in the sampling routine that appeared on the 68030
   but not on the 68020!  (strange?   it was caused by an unintentional
   instruction overlap in the cpu's pipeline.)

 310195
  -sprite anim built in -> dramatical file length increase, but who cares?!
   the logo can be switched on/off using the HELP key

 160295
  -plotting routines optimized
