This little prog is not for use on slow Amigas. A 32 bit processor
and some FastRAM are required, and if it's still too slow the prog
will cancel on its own.

The bytes are read from the parallel port at a rate of 36.8kHz.
Playback is also done at this rate (without Audio DMA!), so it's
quite good quality (at least for 8-bit-sound)

The display is 736x128 pixels large, waveform consists of 736x8 dots.
To give you some figures about the perfomance:
    575 KB/sec clear Fast RAM
    575 KB/sec copy Fast -> Chip
    294400 dots/sec waveform plotting
    36800 interrupts/sec sampling+playback
NOTE: VBR to FastRAM makes this prog slightly faster.

Use these keys while the prog is running:
    F9  show free processor time
    F10 hold display
    ESC exit

The source code is incomplete (includes missing), but you can
have a look at the routines if you're interested.

I would like to get some mail from you, so write to:

bye.
