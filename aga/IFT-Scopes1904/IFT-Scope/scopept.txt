 This program plays a ProTracker module and shows some oscilloscope-like
 plots on the screen. Due to the very CPU-hungry plotting routines and the
 sprite anim it requires an AGA machine. It is recommended to have some
 FastRAM and a powerful processor to enjoy the 'nicer' modes.

 The prog is controlled via keyboard so try these:

  --SCREEN MODES--
  F1 .. Quadrascope 
  F2 .. Stereoscope
  F3 .. Monoscope

  --PLOTTING MODES--
  F6 .. dot
  F7 .. line
  F8 .. solid

  --OTHER CONTROLS--
  F9 ..  show free processor time
  F10 .. hold display
  HELP.. switch the _cool_ Infect logo on/off
  ESC .. exit

 NOTE:
 If your machine is too slow for the selected plotting mode the screen
 borders will flash red. You should use a different mode then.
 (the dotted modes run even on a standard A1200)

 I did not (and I never will!) implement a decruncher for the modules coz:
   -it would mean more work for me to code it :^)
   -I don't need it (CrunchMania + RTDD = MORE_FUN!)
   -there are many good decrunch utilities to do this job
    (just make a little batch file for your personal needs...)

 other features:
   -no AREXX port
   -no MUI support (hi to A.Maschke, thx for the anims!)
   -no multi tasking
   -no file requester (use DirOpus...)

                    sorry to all people who had trouble with it)

 100295
   -recoded from scratch, runs stable now, does not 'eat mem' anymore

 150295
   -some optimizations
