Here is what you are going to need to watch this show from HardDisk:

- AGA Amiga(!)
- 2Mb Chip
- 1Mb Fast (maybe 1½?)
- Harddrive

I think everyone should have these nowadays!

I'm not sure about the real name of this demo but in those Aminets I saw
it with the name "Point Of Sale"...     ...and either I'm not sure about
the group behind it, but the coder seems to be GENGIS. (Maybe Complex?!)

There are some soundbugs when it runs on something faster than an ordinary
Amiga 1200...
