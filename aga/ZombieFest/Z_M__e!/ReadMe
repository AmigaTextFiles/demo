       Since I  first saw  the brilliant  films by George A. Romero I
       have been obsessed with them. Most of you wont have even heard
       of him or his  films,  but here is a list of his `dead` films.
       I have done a promotional picture for each title :-

       o Dawn of the dead (1978)            ]  Dawn_of_the_dead.iff
         aka Zombi                          ]           &
         aka Zombie: Dawn of the dead       ]  Dawn_of_the_dead.tXt

       o Day of the dead (1985)             ]  Day_of_the_dead.iff
                                            ]           &
                                            ]  Day_of_the_dead.tXt

       o Night of the Living dead (1990/68) ]  Night_of_the_dead.iff
                                            ]          &
                                            ]  Night_of_the_dead.tXt

       I made  these pictures in the usual way using deluxe paint and
       personal paint. I made them on my A1200Tg 040/25 and I enjoyed
       doing it ;) If  anyone  else is  a big fan of any Zombie films
       contact me on   gazy@globalnet.co.uk   because I`m considering
       founding an IRC channel for talk about Georgey & similar films
       to his great ones.

       Oh well, thats about it! Look out for more of my work on other
       Amiga  CDs,  The Aminet  and  hopefully in ArrowPds selection!
