Our entry for the Bizarre '96 party, held on the 7th & 8th of
September 1996 in Etten-Leur, the Netherlands.

Well, we were at the Bizarre '96 party and wanted to enter the
Amiga competition. So we decided to make something, but as
usual all our huge plans are cancelled. This demo was inspired
by the guys across our table who were playing this really loud
music with megabassdrum in it... It's really annoying to hear
this gabber music for 2 days long. We decided to make this...

There were 6 entries and we did not become 1st, 2nd or 3rd.
Don't know why not, because everybody was laughing and said
that we would win... Well, too bad :(

Anyway... bye!

PS: It was kind of anonymous, but the organizers at Bizarre
knew who we were, so they used our name everywhere.
