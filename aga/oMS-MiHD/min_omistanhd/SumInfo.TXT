»» Minä Omistan HD-Loader made by Zer0-X! ««

Here is what you are going to need to watch this (mu)sick demo from HardDisk:

- AGA Amiga(!)
- 2Mb Chip
- 1Mb Fast (Or maybe 1½?)
- Harddrive

I think everyone should have these nowadays!


Use the install-script provided to copy your disk to HardDisk!
