	Speed up !

	ProGearSpec by Mankind.

	a HURRY warpos demo


	Code		HURRY UP Krabob
	GFX		HURRY UP Krabob
	GFX		HURRY UP Grenat
	MSX		HURRY UP Tex.
	
	done by madness just before going to the army...
	(in 5 hours I disappear.)
			
	need to run: a ppc + warpos (powerpc.library)
	+ AHI
	+ dbplayer.library v2.0 (it's given.)
	

	CGX ->
	** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED **
	** DONT TRY IT: IT CRASHES **
	( graphic card user can try "WB window" but it's
	uglily 8bit-remapped. )
	( watch out for a fix-patch before december 1999)

	HAM6 12bit is the best at the moment.	
	CGX will be 15bit and faster (I SWEAR.)
		
	How to run ProGearSpec ?
	
	if you didn't have dbplayer.library in your
	LIBS: directory, copy it once for all.

	How can I Skip the prefs Window ?
	
	By setting values in the tooltypes in icon/info  !
	possible values are:
ScreenID= 

pal 
pal256
dblpal
cgx	** NOT YET ** 
win     ** WB Window (ugly) **

ahiID=

PaulaMono
PaulaStereo
Req		**  ahi requester **

	
	If everything went OK, The UKONX guys will send all this
	for me on aminet in early october.


	peskanov ! this one was coded both in c & asm !
	(using vbcc & pasm.)
	(some routines could be faster anyway.)
			
	greets to UKONX , all amiga PPC coders,
	To venus art for the asm C2P
	to the spanish scene, to pure, to lucis magia,
	at the slash party.
	Like KIKI prod say:
	
	Make MORE DEMOS !!!
