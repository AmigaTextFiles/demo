;  A script used to run LOGIC on a4000 with WARP.
;
;  Enables all caches we could think of :).  The demo itself does
;  NOT modify cache flags, so if you have an 'exotic' turbocard,
;  feel free to experiment.
;
;  NOTE!  The file "MUTANTTI.LIB" =MUST= be renamed to "mutantti.library"
;  (remember the case) beforehand.
