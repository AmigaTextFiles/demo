This production requires a hard drive and about 4mb fastmem (it could run on
less, but we haven`t tested it). Simply copy the cv dir to your demodir and
run Cartoonviolence.exe. Note you must have the c commands in your dh0:c
directory, they are included incase you don't have them. (Sorry for the
glitches throughout, this was rushed. The anim may occasionally crash on
exit so try clicking around mid screen or you can run part 2 seperately
from CLI).

Some words about this production:

All gfx and music were made about 4 years ago, but never were released.
Since getting my hands on an amiga once again I decided to make this
release possible with the help of Thunder. 

Admitedly Prophesy can't claim to be a scene group, we have no programmers
or serious talent amongst us we just want to contribute some tacky humor to 
the Amiga in general using various software to do it. I hope there is
somebody out there that will apreciate our style, but at the end of the day
I make gfx and music for my own enjoyement and not for public demand.



News about Upcoming Prods:

Various animations and fun productions including:

Seriously violent Wrestling anim.
Halloween anim (hopefully, if Thunder has time)
One Christmas Night anim (already finished, but will be released nearer xmas) 

and hopefully more little things to keep me busy through those dark winter
nights...

I should get the mail forwarded to me. Please allow delays for my reply 
cos I don`t have my own net connection or email address. 

byeeeee..
