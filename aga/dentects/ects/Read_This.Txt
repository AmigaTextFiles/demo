INFORMATION.

This archive should contain backstab.library (+docs)
			    loadmap.library
			    Dentaku26 (executable)
			    maps/shit.den

To get the demo to run you require any AGA machine.

1 - Copy all the programs to the required directory : The libraries go in your libs: directory
2 - Assign that directory as ECTS: otherwise the demo will not work.
3 - Ensure that the map file (shit.den) is in ECTS:maps/
4 - Run Dentaku26
5 - Run FlushBackStab - this should ensure that your system is safer from crashes

I recommend you test this on a tv, not a monitor - it usually provides better results!

 Problems
----------

This demo may trash memory somewhere in the door routine I think. As such, problems
have been known on certain machines. Problems have been experienced with Backstab not 
closing properly, and FlushBackStab will patch that problem. It need only be run once
after Dentaku, and then you need'nt use it again, even if you rerun backstab (as long
as you don't reboot of course!). 

 Info
------

Firstly - If you would like to start a career in games, then contact us if you're serious.
We are looking for near complete games, coders, artists, musicians - all particularly on the PC.

The Gfx in this demo is quite a mish-mash since we were testing all sorts of things at the time.

DentECTS is a demo of Dentaku26 completed in early September. Since then much has changed,
so PLEASE DON'T SEND ME *ANY* BUG REPORTS OR COMPLAINTS OR ANYTHING! Things like the keyboard
controls have all been improved, the screen can be made bigger etc. You can now have walls
of any length and angle, we have a full OS3.0 editor etc.
The demo provided here is, I suppose, merely an enhancement to the DentWolf demo released
in June(ish). So at least you can see that things have improved a bit......

The keys are:

Joystick Control - Movement
Cursors - Movement
< / > - Move left / right
Fire/Space - Open or Close Door
F8 - Turn Collision Detection On/Off
F9 - Decrease Smoothness (Frame Rate)
F10 - Increase Smoothness(Frame Rate)
Help - Information and Contact addresses
1/2 on the keypad - Some debug info
Left Mouse Button - Quit

Finally, we require people to design and test levels for us for the final version ( which still
needs a lot of work unfortunately) so contact us if you are interested......

Remember - NO BUG REPORTS PLEASE. I haven't touched this code for months, and I am not going
back to it! So there......
