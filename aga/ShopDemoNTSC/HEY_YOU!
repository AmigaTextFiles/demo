Nosy aren't we? :)  Well, since there was 3072 bytes left, I thought I'd
waffle a bit!

I'm afriad there wasn't enough space to put the "PeverlyHills" demo back in.
I could have got rid of the _Clown piccy, and put Peverly in it's place, but
I think a happy clown face stands-out better - and looks nicer than a blocky
ham-8 landscape fly-through.

SpriteLA makes the info screens look MUCH better - people might actually
look at them for more than half a femto second now ;) .  Only problem is that
when a new screen opens, it makes the 'boing ball' go from red to grey :( .
Some git forgot to set the correct palette for new screens...  Still,
looks good.  I doubt that it can be fixed - any ideas?

With the advent of the Walker (nice case, shame about the code-name), I hope
this disk will become obsolete!  Since it's got a harddrive AND CD-ROM drive
it should be very easy to either install some c00L demos manually, or provide
some on CD...  FINALLY we can do an Amiga justice :-)  - you don't think I
actually think the demos on this disk are the best do you?  They were the
best that could fit on 1 disk, had no swearing (hello Nexus7 !), and would
self-exit (see Nexus7 again) - which drastically cuts-down <sob> the number
of demos to use.  Wish I could put Tint on here!

Perhaps I'll put a proper thank-you list in the next version?  I need to get
this one out ASAP!  Which begs the question - why am I still writing this
crap?  Easy!  I want to have 0 bytes left! ;^)  Actually, this is where I get
to say what I want without sticking it in the 'official' readme..

I would have used this space for another demo - but 3072 bytes is just too
small to put anything vaguley nice in!

    Guess i better stop now....
