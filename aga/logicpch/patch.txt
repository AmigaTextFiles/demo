LOGIC Patch
-----------

This patch will fix a few things:  Copyback cache and non-zero VBR should
work now.  Also a small problem with the player should be gone.  There are
also .info-files for the executables for WB startup.

Apply this patch to the files that were spread in the partyplace.  The
files should be called "LOGICC1.LHA" and "LOGICC2.LHA".  To be even more
sure, check that the file "README.TXT" has size 2527 and the file "LOGIC.EXE"
has size 48292.

To do the patch-up, make sure that "LOGIC:" is assigned to the demo directory
with the demo (depacked ofcourse).  Then just execute the file "patch_it":
  1> Execute patch_it

Then just wait ... :)

Have fun!
