»» Maximum Overdrive 2 HD-Loader (fixed) made by Zer0-X! ««

Here is what you are going to need to watch this nice show from HardDisk:

- AGA Amiga
- 2Mb Chip
- 3Mb Fast
- Harddrive

I think everyone should have these nowadays!


Use the install-script provided to copy your disks to HardDisk!

ATTENTION!: There is now a bug fixed that caused no sounds when VBR was
            located in FAST-RAM.
