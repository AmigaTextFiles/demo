Hello there! 
Capsule will began a campaign in favour of the ppc in brief time, trying
to obtain support from the organizers of the major parties.
Our target is to make a BIG demo for ppc, and to encourage another 
groups to jump the ppc wagon aswell. We believe the P5 boards are
one of the last oportunities we have to stay (near) the same power level
that PeeCee's have today (well, maybe the past year :)
We also believe that the Amiga scene has much to offer with this kind of
speed. Let's show everybody our scene is not sleeping!

	Please, if your group is working/going to work in a ppc production,
let us know so we can make a list of ppc supporters and coordinate efforts:
	
	Estrayk (Capsule organizer):
		calamo@vlc.servicom.es
		
	Peskanov (ppc coder):
		malemana@nexo.es
