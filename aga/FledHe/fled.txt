	This whole AMIGA release is dedicated to Dejko/ex-TPM.  We wish you
a  wonderful REAL life without your AMIGA!  Try to prove it possible ;1 The
Pas  Mas  will always remember you as you were when you joined:  a shy li'l
gal  in  a see-thru night gown, eager to learn the ways of life and natures
clockwork.   All  those  moments  now  are  gone, buhuhu!  Suicide, anyone?
                                  Naw!..
