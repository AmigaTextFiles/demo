    We take absolutely no responsibility whatever the buttons below may
 cause to your health, sanity, grandpa or something else, if you press 'em.
    If you are not interested in your life as it is now, just go ahead.
                    You will never be the same. Never.

                           YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED


 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Ain't My Time " system "data/0a.dat data/111.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Have you ever wondered where the dead go after they've been incinerated?
 The truth is simple. The Hell is overcrowded, and there is no room in
 heaven for all of you. Not to mention the other Dungeon Dimensions
 which are full of rotting humans. The only solution available for
 the Inhuman Authorities is to send all souls to a special waiting
 dimension. Aeons tick away as they float ever onwards. There
 is little hope that any of them will ever be assigned elsewhere.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Culex Latens " system "data/0a.dat data/112.dat blank reltime 6"}

 Ia! Hidden from the human eyes, the Ancient Ones await for their Revenge
 in disturbed sleep. But their inner bodily functions are active and
 they feed on the pitiful earthlings passing by. Soon their diet will
 be over and the feast on dismembered human carcasses shall begin. Ia!
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Hevosten Vuori " system "data/0a.dat data/113.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Up in the Quadruple Mountains live a sinister tribe of flying Quadruples.
 They are strictly carnivorous, having specialized in human meat. If
 they wanted, they could trash the humanity without much sweat.
 Fortunately for you, they have made a deal with US Government which
 supplies them with human meat. Every day they are given several
 megatons of minced, concentrated Homo Sapiens. Of course only the finest
 parts of humans will be used, while the leftovers (95%) will continue
 their life as pet supplements.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Psychedelica " system "data/0a.dat data/114.dat blank reltime 5"}

 Trip in the Other Planes if you will. Feel your body sucked into
 the vacuum through the Dimensional Door. Experience the personification
 of Death push you Outside. And the rumour has that only Melkor has
 escaped the Outside, while others are destined to stay there forever,
 in the middle of nothingness.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Rekursiivisuuden Kosto " system "data/0a.dat data/115.dat blank reltime 3"}

 In other place, other time, hordes of Pacmen-class demons are spawned
 by an insane mage. With a sick smile on his face he sends them to
 conquer other realities. And that is not all. His evil Pacmen factory
 is duplicated over and over. As you can see, the copies require no
 maintenance at all.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" The Tree Musketeers " system "data/0a.dat data/116.dat blank reltime 5"}

 It's the Old Oak Tree! And it's endless horde of Tree Musketeers.
 Even you can't be so stupid that you can't see what they're up to.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 @{" Triangle Of Colours " system "data/0a.dat data/117.dat blank reltime 4"}

 The correct transformation of appearance by the Law of the Spheres.
 Near the border you can see the trace of the beings origin, but it's
 only a faint memory of the last place where it has been. The real
 birthplace is untraceable with mundane methods.
