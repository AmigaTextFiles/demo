        smellon design secret pickupline (allways works for me!) :

Go to a girl, and check out the label that's in her shirt...
when she sais : hey what are you doing ?!!!
you say       : just checking if you are really made in heaven.

        release info :

This demo should have been released ages ago,
but i was to lazy to do the coding/gfx/cooking and cleaning myself.

        last words :
