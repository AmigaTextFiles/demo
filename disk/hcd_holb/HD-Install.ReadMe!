Welcome to this little installation guide for Hymns Of Logic, our very
first music disk ever! This guide is only intended for those who don't 
have a copy of Commodore's Installer-utility. If you know you do, 
put it in your C: directory and click on the HD-Install icon. Now
follow the instructions and you'll soon have a working version of the
music disk on your harddrive!

Anyhow, if you belong to the poor ones who have never seen Commodore's
Installer-utility, here's how to get along:

      1. Create a directory on your harddrive with a suitable name, and
         copy the following files from disk # 1 to it:

         FILE                     DESCRIPTION
         ¯¯¯¯                     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         "HymnsOfLogic.exe"       The Music Disk!
         "HymnsOfLogic"           Startup-Script
         "Hymns-MWB.inf"          An ordinary 4-colour icon
                                  Rename to "HymnsOfLogic.info" !
         "HymnsOfLogic.info"      A neat 8-colour MagicWB icon
                                  (If you don't have MagicWB, get it
                                  (immediately!  :)

         "HymnsIntro.exe"         Guess what...

         "Blue Vibrations"        Tune
         "South Of Sense"         Tune
         "Trip To Outland"        Tune

         When done, copy these files from disk # 2:

         FILE                     DESCRIPTION
         ¯¯¯¯                     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         "Groove Yard"            Tune
         "Popin'Up"               Tune
         "The Steel Dome"         Tune


      2. Now I reckon that was extremely hard work!? :-)

         To start, you only have to run the script called
         "HymnsOfLogic", preferably by clicking the icon, or
         if you don't have MagicWB, execute the script from
         CLI. Owners of Kickstart 2.0 and above only need to
         type "HymnsOfLogic", while 1.3-users have to type
         the whole line "execute HymnsOfLogic".

      3. Sit back and enjoy!




* NOTE: We have tested this music disk on several types of Amigas,
including A500/A1200/A3000/A4000. We've also made sure it works 
alright on 68000/020/030/040 CPU's, and of course on OS 1.3 and 2.0
as well as on OS 3.0. If you've got 2MB Chip or some extra Fast
you should easily be able to load all tunes into memory, thereby 
decreasing the loading time to absolutely zero!
