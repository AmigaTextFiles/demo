                              The Scene Archives

    Have you always been after a CD which has:-
            - 100% demos, and no crappy mods/pics, except for party releases
            - Totally Error Free (I have tried to maintain a 100% error free
                                  ratio, but you know, gremlins can reign
                                  terror on files.. :-) )
            - Is in an Organised Way..
    
    Well, if you have, then I welcome you to "The Scene Archives".

    I admit, the aim of this project is to provide the common user with access
to all the scene material that is available..  Yes, I have found some of these
items  on  various  other CD's (not mentioning names), but the other disks are
usually  very  badly organised, and some of the files are errored..  But, note
that this total package contains aover 6100 disks of my own collection, which
many have NEVER been on CD before.

    The  ordering  of this CD is the disk numbering system that I use at home.
Gotta sort them somehow!!

    There are currently 4 Volumes made so far.  They are :-
            Volume #1 - Disks 0001 to 1001
            Volume #2 - Disks 1002 to 2000
            Volume #3 - Disks 2001 to 3000
            Volume #4 - Disks 3001 to 3999

    Volume #5 is underway, but it takes a lot of time to organise each CD, so
it'll take some time..

    Ok, now the credits:-

        All disks collected by:- Tony Hasselbacher (The Heavyweight/Broken)
        CD design and Made by:-  Tony Hasselbacher (The Heavyweight/Broken)

    "The Scene Archives" contain the following type of scene material:-

        Animation - This is an animation (??)
        Demo Packs - These are a collection of various items, which is on one
                     disk, with a spiffy menu.  Some people really hate these
                     demo packs, but I think that they are very important as
                     they sometimes have nice small productions on it.
        Dentro/Demo - I count this as a production which is in one file and
                      this also contains BBS Intros.  
        Digis:- This is just digitized samples
        Document Disks - As it says..  Respect the Copyright laws when you use
                         these.
        Intro - These are usually small, one part productions.
        Magazine - A digital magazine (wow!)
        Menus - These are just menus that are used for demo packs
        Miscellaneous - Things that don't fit elsewhere
        Music Demos - Productions with music as the main feature
        Slideshows - Productions with graphics as the main feature
        Trackmo - This is a really large demo that has usally a lot of really
                  cool effects.. These are the best :-) 

    Finally,  I  like  to greet ALL the people I have ever known, as they have
enriched my life in the Scene (The Amiga and the C64!).

    Read the enclose volume listsings to see what is on each volume.  And
there is a totally indexed lists of all my collection (so you can see what is
coming up :-) )
