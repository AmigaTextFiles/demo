message         : it was an experimental music video done in AdobePremiere5.5
              	  just for fun. Video premiere was on Channel the 1st
		  (national TV) in Garaza (Garage) TV show and 3K in
                  summer 2001. It took second place on
                  "FLAG 2001 - European Demo Scene Meeting" compupter party
		  that was held on 6th - 8th july 2001. in Budapest, Humgary.
		  It also appeared on AmigaFormat CD, UK computer magazine.

		   "The Evil Toothbrush" music video is done using following programs:

		   - octaMED Sound Studio V1.3c /amiga/ for music composing
		   - soundprobe2 /amiga/ & pro station audio /amiga/
 		     for remix & special sfx
		   - adobe premiere 5 /pc/ for video editing
		   - 3D studio /pc/ for 3D animations
		   - adobe photoshop /pc/ & H&P arteffect /amiga/ for some artwork

		  I sampled my (now ex)-gf Jelena (Echo / Kira)'s voice saying:
		  "Perite Zube & Slusajte D.J. Nick-a" and "Wash Your Teeth and
 		  Listen DJNick", applied reverb and put it in song reversely.
		  From time to time you'll notice 25th frame and some more hidden
		  messages.

                  I was influenced by "Hey Boy, Hey Girl" / Chemical Brothers
		  & "Smack My Bitch Up" / Prodigy music videos :)

                1 it's not allowed to use this music video for a commercial product
                2 editing this text is not allowed
                3 remixing this song is allowed ;)
