		        brings you Phenomena's Enigma
		      FIXED/FILECONVERTED/IMPROVED (EXIT)

			       Done by SHD


	The demo quits with RMouse (LMouse skips parts) ...

	No bugs occured on my 030-50 and that's why I let the user to
	decide the state of caches. So if you're having problems (040/060)
	then turn some caches off and it just might run. Otherwise, contact
	me...


	My previous releases (ramversions mainly) (all work with AGAs)
	--------------------------------------------------------------

	'*' means important (atleast for me)
	'-6' means problems on 060 (however, still worth trying)
	'+6' tested and worked on 060
