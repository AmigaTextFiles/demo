This  is  a  POC (proof of concept) demo made by the 'Red Devils' for the next
generation  Amiga  computers  and  AmigaOS 4.0.  The idea was to show how easy
something is ported to this new platform.  The 3D engine used in this demo was
kindly  donated by The Black Lotus, ported to OS4 and enhanced by Robert Kihl.
The  demo  was  shown at the Swedish Amiga fair AmiGBG 2005, and ranked #2 at
fYaNICA 05.

There  are  still  some  fixes needed to be done, but we decided to release it
as-is  for now.  The demo requires AmigaOne XE and Radeon graphics with Warp3D
support.    It   will  probably  run  on  µA1  but  could  need  some  further
optimization.

Coding:     Kalms, Kihl
Graphics:   Prof, Vector, Cobra
Music:      Teo/Exceed


Enjoy!

                  The project would not have been possible
                  without the support from Guru Meditation.
