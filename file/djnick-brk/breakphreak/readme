video created w/: Amiga OctaMED Sound Studio (for music) &

		  &

		  PC (for video composing)

message         : basic idea was to produce music video taht will look like
		  a coded demo, not as classic video. each scene should look
		  like a party flyer.

                  I was influenced by old skool music that was playing a lot in
		  80's and 90's - break dance so I took this concept during music
		  composing.

		  it is all edited by me and is also my first video I used to work on
		  and also learn AdobePremiere 5.0 in free time on TV station where
		  I worked in 1999.

		  BreakPhreak.mpg is also released on CD of UK's AmigaFormat magazine
		  and was played a lot on various TV stations across the country.
