SHD OF MYSTIC converted Lemon's "Rink A Pink" for today's standards.

The Demo quits with the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON. Use left mouse button to
stop the scroller in the last part.

Short note: Sorry about the bug in the plasma effect (didn't have
the time (or the skills) to fix this effect).

Another note: To see the SECRET PART put an 'S' parameter to the
executable (example on CLI: Lemon.RinkPink S).

Compability note: Not tested on 060.
