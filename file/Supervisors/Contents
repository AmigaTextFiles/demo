SUPERVISORS MUSIC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This archive contains the music from a Supervisors intro, written for a very
old crackparty. The music I assume is by SLL/Kefrens, but I'm not sure. The
demo itself is included here, as it still works today!

mod.sll.3 - second music in intro. Owlz sez he has it for the Spectrum 128k
            soundtracker, in 3-channel form! He's right!

mod.sll7  - first music in the intro. I used it in my first demo in 1993
            called "How to write a demo in AMOS"!

supervisors.exe - the intro itself, released in a time when the Amiga was
                  new, and the C64 ruled...

Enjoy!  -Kyzer/CSG
