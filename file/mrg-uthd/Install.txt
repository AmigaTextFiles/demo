This is just a small release to make my ol' party-winning
demo called 'Unknown Territory' Harddisk Installable...

Make sure you've assigned 'UTdata:' to the directory where
you've put the file 'UnknownTerritory.data'.

Now you are able to run 'Unknown Territory' from the Workbench
or a shell. ( The demo can't be quitted 8-)

If about 900Kb of free FASTmem is availabe, this demo will be
loaded into fastmem, otherwise allocating CHIPmem at $100000
will be tried. If allocating chipmem also fails, the loader
will quit. 

If you can't get it to work, or some bugs should appear, drop
a message addressed to 'JACK' at No Vegetables.....
