video created w/: OctaMED Sound Studio (for music) &
                  Amiga 1200T & Blizzard 040 / 25 mhz (for LightWave3D rendering)

		  &

		  PC (for video editing) with MiroDC10
							at that time.

message         : this was my first music video ever, made in 1997.
		  all animations were produced by SEnder (sender@ptt.yu)
		  using his Amiga 030 and my Amiga 040 for rendering robots
		  (that took over a month for all animations to render)...

		  this video appeared in AmigaFormat (UK computer magazine)
		  in 1998. and took first prize as best reader work.

		  it played a lot on TV stations all over the country.
