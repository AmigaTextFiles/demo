=========================================
To Install and Run the Talkmaster
=========================================

Use "install libs" then copy program anywhere you desire.

OR:

Make sure that- narrator.device is in 
DH0:Devs/
translator.library is in DH0:Libs/
amos.library is in DH0:Libs/
Say is in DH0:C/

Just push buttons to talk or push "type" button and type in
sentences and hit return to talk. Type "Quit" to return to 
button mode. That about it!!
