About JoinSpliter v1.12 by Deniil 715! for HDU
=========================================

JoinSpliter is a program that you can use to split and join files with!
It was made in 15/10 1998!

Two very special features of this program is that it doesn't make 
headers and the files doesn't need to have filenames like f.ex. 
splfile.001, splfile.002, splfile.003 etc. But be aware of that it do 
makes files like that but doesn't require it for joining!

When you are joining files you only have to pick them into a lister 
and press "Join"! You only have to pick one file if you got a serie of 
files and the program will find the rest of them! The files will be 
joined from the top of the lister and down.

New for this version is that you now can "shift-select" files to join!

Some feature when spliting is that you can select if you want a 
fixed size of the splited files, if you want to optimize the use of 
every diskette or whatever you use. In this case the splitfiles will be 
in different size depending on how much space that's left on each 
disc. Press cancel when a disc is full and select/insert a new disk.
With the last split-method can you specify how many files you want
the mainfile to be splited in.

This program is compatible with all spliters/joiners that's not 
packing or crypt data or sets a tail on some/every file!

Compatible with:
The standard AmigaDOS Join.
