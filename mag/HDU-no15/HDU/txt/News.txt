News 1 : About new developments in Amiga market
=========================================

Samba World Cup Delayed. 
I'm sure that a lot of you are wondering just what has happened 
to this game, well, I can tell you that it has been finished and has 
been for quite a while. 

The main cause of delay has been due to a few problems with 
the publisher in ythe Uk. The game will no longer be released by 
Alive Mediasoft as was planned. I'm not going to go into the 
reasons for this here, these can be got directly from the author if 
you so require. 

The author of the game is currently actively looking for a new 
publisher and has been in talks with Epic marketing to name just 
one. Sayonara Software hope to have the game released in the 
UK sometime this month. I'll keep you updated on the situation. 

=========================================
MAX Rally Update 
=========================================

As you may well know, this game has now been released and 
orders are being taken for it by the developers. I have recently 
received a review copy of the game so expect to see the 
low-down of the game on these pages very soon. Early opinions 
on the game are quite positive, it looks to be a very nice game. 
Like I say, look out for the full low-down very soon. 

=========================================
Digital Images & Wipeout 2097. 
=========================================

Things seem to be progressing nicely on this front and it looks 
as though a deal for Wipeout 2097 could be signed very soon. 
Reports that we're recently published in Amiga Format stating 
that the deal has been signed and that the game will be released 
in January arn't quite true at this moment in time, it would seem 
that they we're jumping the gun somewhat. As soon as any deal 
is signed you'll see it here first. 

=========================================
Amiga Extreme - New Web Magazine
=========================================
A new web magazine has recently been opened. It is called 
'Amiga Extreme' and is entirely dedicated to 3D gaming, 
something which we'll hopefully see a lot more on on the Amiga 
in the future. The authors plan to include news, reviews and 
information on Amiga 3D games in the future, maybe we'll see 
them reporting on such games as Quake 2 in the future.... 

The new site can be found at:- http://www.amigaextreme.com 

There isn't much there at the moment, however, the authors plan 
to change this very soon. If you have any ideas, suggestions or 
comments about the site don't hesitate to contact them at:-

Vulcan Halt Amiga Classic Games Development.
=========================================
Vulcan have just announced to the Amiga community that they 
will be stopping all development of there Amiga classic range. 
This is something that has been on the cards for quite a while 
and doesn't really come as a big surprise. Below is the full press 
release :

GOODBYE AMIGA CLASSIC! 
Vulcan is finally closing the lid on Amiga (classic) software 
development after half a decade of support! The decision to 
leave comes close to Vulcans 5th anniversary. Paul Carrington 
states '..after much deliberation we switched off our Amiga 
development systems at the mains, quickly wrapped them in 
brown paper and hid them in the Vulcan vault! It's quite sad to 
see these babies being turned off but it is something we all knew 
was inevitable (and perhaps long overdue).' Since 1994 Vulcan 
has Developed and Published 10 Amiga floppy titles and 5 
Amiga CDRom titles and currently has 2 more Amiga CDRom 
titles still in production and nearing release. I hope that our 
departure from Amiga (classic) software development does not 
receive the same insulting and slanderous response as previous 
departing companies had experienced, but our decision is based 
purely on a commercial and financial level due to the current 
state of the existing Amiga market. 

To show our loyalty to the platform (which was responsible for 
our companies success) we will remain as an active Amiga 
Publisher as long as there are external developers out there 
creating exciting products and require our services and as long 
as our Amiga distributor still has an outlet to sell limited 
quantities of Amiga titles. 

Vulcan has just released a limited edition Amiga compilation 
CDRom of it's MiniSeries titles as a tribute to it's golden days and 
we can still expect the Alien adventure 'Wasted Dreams' Amiga 
CDRom to be released before Xmas 98 with Explorer2260 
Amiga PPC CDRom scheduled for early 99. 

This is a decision that Vulcan should be supported in, not 
condemed for. One thing I would like to point out clearly even 
though it is said above, is that this announcment doesn't mean 
they will no longer publish games, mearly that they will no longer 
develop games themselves. Both Wasted Dreams & 
Explorer2260 will be released by them, as will any other good 
looking games that come there way.

Latest Reports From Computer 98 Show
=========================================
Early reports from Cologne seem to indicate that Settlers 2 is 
coming to the Amiga and will be published by Titan Computers.  
This has now been confirmed, Settlers 2 will be made for the 
traditional line of processors along with a special PPC version.  
The planned release date is January of next year. There are 
further reports coming through that Titan Computer will be 
announcing more up coming games at the show or soon after 
with a demo of Claws Of The Devil to be released in two weeks 
time.

Please Note that the above screenshot of Settlers 2 is from the 
PC version ClickBOOM revealed on the Computer 98 IRC that 
they would have major announcements concerning conversions.  
They are also set to announce news regarding Quakeworld.

Reports have also come in that QNX has been chosen as the 
OS partner for the new Amiga. I have few details of the 
announcement which was made by Jeff Schindler of Amiga Inc 
on Friday night but I hope to receive more soon.  If you have 
been at the Computer 98 Show and know more, then contact 
Amiga Flame.
