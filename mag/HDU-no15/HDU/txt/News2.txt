NEWS ABOT AIGA GAMES - part 2
=========================================

Battle
=========================================
It was well over a year ago that Battle, a war game in the style of 
the old Blue Byte Game, Battle Isle was announced.  At that time 
we were told that a demo of Battle would soon follow but after a 
few months the web site belonging to, Amiga Games 
Development disappeared without a trace.  It had seemed that it 
was one of those games that would not see the light of day 
again, however the developers have re-established contact to 
inform readers that development has been proceeding and they 
are looking for help in its production.

Battle boasts 4 different races with up to four human players 
fighting it out in maps as big as 256x256 fields.  In some 
instances the missions will span over 3 or 4 maps. They plan to 
include different daytime's such as night, day, smog and to make 
the weather conditions effect the game of play there will be 
clouds and storms, adding to the realism of any battlefield.  They 
haven't revealed to much in the way of units except from the 
screenshots seen here but there should be plenty with them not 
only having limited armour but limited fuel. Once Battle has been 
released new units, maps and missions will be made available 
from their homepage. The inclusion of a map editor should bring 
up some unusual maps that others will be able to play.

However, the developers do require the help of a good coder 
who can use C or ASM, a 2D graphics artist and some 3D 
graphics artists. This should guarantee the production of Battle 
and hopefully put together a war game that will beat of the likes 
of Battle Isle. Battle will require an 030 processor, 16MB Ram, 8x 
speed CD-Rom Drive, 20 MB Hard Drive, and PPC support is 
under consideration.

Quake 2 For The Amiga?
==============================================
There is a distinct possibly that Quake 2 may be on the cards as 
Digital Images have confirmed intentions that they are to 
establish contact with ID Software regarding the possibly of 
bringing Quake 2 to Amiga PowerPC Gamers.

Digital Images made the decision after ClickBOOM said that they 
won't be doing a PPC version of Quake. They intend to obtain a 
Licence for Quake 2 and release it PowerPC only for the Amiga 
as the traditional Amiga processor would not be up to the job.  
They have stressed that they are only looking  into the licencing 
and that they may not get it but we can be hopeful that they will 
and show are support.

Just in case you are wondering how they manage to develop so 
many games, it is that they have such a big team behind Digital 
Images.

Update: The Holy Trinity
==============================================
Some months ago HDU reported that the development team 
behind The Holy Trinity were looking for Programmers, 2D/ 3D 
Graphic Artists, Sound Effect Artists, and Musicians. You will be 
pleased to know that they received a good response and so got 
all the necessary staff, their are now 8 in total.

The Holy Trinity is a 3D rendered adventure/ RPG for the Amiga 
with 3D rendered Myst-like graphics with area animation and 
Final Fantasy VII combat and menu system.  The Holy Trinity is 
based on the traditional lines of a war between good and evil.  It 
was a thousand years ago when an army of demons destroyed 
the neighboring villages of Garandia in search of a hidden 
satanic power concealed for centuries by a warlock run amok.  
Many lives were lost at the hands of the execution squads 
deployed by the Evil One, the survivors of these attacks were 
forced to live a horror worse than death: enslavement in the Evil 
One's army of the damned. The Evil One uncovered the Soul 
Forge, a massive power source capable of leveling an entire 
village in the blink of an eye. However, unknown to the Evil One, 
a chosen one was being born into the world, chosen by the High
One to vanquish the Evil One and his army of demonic souls.  
You play this Chosen One.

It'll feature as said earlier, 3D Myst-like backgrounds with area 
animation's like moving waterfalls, 3D rendered cut-scenes, 
digitized voice dialogue in an evolving storyline that changes 
based on the player's actions. It is interesting to note that Digital 
Visionaries have stated it will have a Final Fantasy VII combat 
system.

You'll notice by the hand drawn design picture of Phoenix that 
The Holy Trinity is at the initial design stages but it is interesting 
to see the early beginnings of such as game. Phoenix, their 
newest character is a forest dweller, poor and filthy. Phoenix 
roams Garandia forest until she discovers Gabriel wandering 
through the forest. Gabriel scares her by accident and she runs 
away. She eventually meets up with Gabriel and aids him on his 
quest to vanquish the Evil One.

The Holy Trinity will require an 030 processor, 4MB Fast Ram, is 
CD-Rom only and supports GFX cards for enchanced graphics 
and resolution.  Its expected release date is the middle of 1999.
