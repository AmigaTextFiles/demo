    | How to run the gallery |
    `------------------------'

    Boot  from  disk  and  you  will  see.  There's a little script which
display  a  little  text and execute the gallery.  In case you downloaded
from  aminet,  then  you don't have the needed workbench 1.3 commands and
files.   We  can supply you with them if you need to.  Also included is a
small bootblock installer coded by Touchstone/Essence.  This bootblock is
real cool and also works on a500!  :)

  Complete file structure:
