.retro.votesheet..............................................................

 Since Retro is a brand new magazine on the scene, we, the editors, are 
 quite uncertain how the scene will react to it. We hope that it will be 
 praised as a good mag, featuring exciting articles, interviews and the 
 likes, but are equally prepared to be confronted with negative critics.

 Therefore, in order to make Retro just a little bit better than the 
 average magazine, we want to check how the conditions are for our
 little "baby". We would greatly appreciate it if you could fill out
 this little "votesheet" (in lack of a better name), and return it to 
 our spreaders. 

 In advance we thank you, b'coz the scene ain't a spectators sport.

 The Retro-staff.
