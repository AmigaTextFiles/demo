                               Dear Readers!


this is the sixth issue of "Jurassic Pack", made during the last hours of
the Mekka&Symposium party in Hamburg, Germany, done by Fishwave & me.

This is a different version from that, being spread at the party. As there
was a bug concerning the music we had to compile this "bugfixed" one.


                                   Burp!


How much can you expect from a 12 hours production made on a foreign computer,
without any prepared files, in sleepy conditions, just a mag from 0 to 100 in
one day?

Read read it yourself and you`ll know.. ;-)


                                   P.S.:

    Most demo/intro-productions were made during less hours then this!
