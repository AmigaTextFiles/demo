°PROGDIR:data/clips/vague.raw°8°At ~last! The ~first ~issue of the ~first ~warp3d ~emag is born and all of us who ~are
working on this project are pleased to present it to you.

We ~do not support ~AGA ~this ~time, because, ~AGA can't provide ~all ~the ~necessary
stuff ~for a ~high quality ~diskmag ~~today. ~Maybe ~if ~we ~do a second edition, ~we ~will
create an AGA/HAM version of this diskmag with some necessary losses~~~~in quality
and features.
 
Well, this project took too much time, and could have been finished ~one ~year ~ago,
but~~~you all know about all the problems that occur all the time and always (amen).
We do not have too much content,~~~~but we have tried to make it good looking and
interesting to read. We hope you will enjoy it.

A~~~lot~~~of~~~thinking and planning changed while~~~we~~~worked.~~~I'm not referring ~to ~problems
with gfx,~~~articles and~~~so~~~on.~~~It was~~~the~~~~structure that~~~~changed.~~~Initially,~~~we ~cooperated
with the creators of the polish amiga diskmag SevenDays by LazyMinds:
http://aminet.net/demo/mag/7days.lha

°PROGDIR:data/clips/lazyminds.raw°12°
They contributed some music,~~~~some ideas,~~~~and some articles from the "Taboo" ezine
which were translated with permission of ~the authors from polish to ~english. ~~Greg
also wrote an ~~interesting ~~article ~about his ~~nostalgia. ~But ~~only ~one ~man ~from ~this
group ~~is ~~still ~~helping us ~a ~bit ~~with ~this ~~project (morphos ~~tests ~and ~~offers ~some
ideas) - Stefkos.~~~Others from LazyMinds moved away from the ~horizon,~~~~and ~we ~do
not know where they are and what they do now.

The ~second attempt was to cooperate ~with ~Kubika,~~~~a WWW emag http://kubika.dk
We ~talked ~with ~Adonis ~about ~it ~and everything was ~looking promising. ~i would be
working on the warp3d version,~~~~while Adonis would do the html version.~~~~But,~~~In the
end, the effort did not turn out to be very fruitful.

°PROGDIR:data/clips/kubika.raw°11°
Sometime in between the efforts,~~i wrote ~an ~article for ~HUGI 32 about ~our project,
hoping that someone would be ~interested and help us a bit. But unfortunately, ~not
much help~~~was~~~recieved.~~You ~can read about~~~it~~~~on http://hugi.~scene.~org/online/hugi32/
The article~~~is~~~called~~~"A new Amiga diskmag is born".~~~~~Also,~~~when ~we ~began to ~work,
we ~~created ~a ~~little ~~(and ~~fairly ~primitive) ~~invtro ~~called ~~'lamvtro' ~~about ~~our ~~project
(nothing ~special, only a ~few screens, ~some ~easy ~animations ~and old ~funny ~music).
From this we hoped ~that ~someone ~interested ~in a ~warp3d diskmag would help us.
And some help was recieved after all.

°PROGDIR:data/clips/inv.raw°9°  
And ~after ~all of this ~work, we ~are ~glad ~to ~see ~that ~it ~is ~finished. How ~you ~can
use this diskmag engine? You can use keyboard or mouse or both.
