Year ~~2007 ~~is ~~still ~~ongoing, ~~but ~~~we ~~~have ~~~already ~~seen ~~~one ~~~of ~~~the ~~~big ~~~parties
where~~~~in~~~~~recent years~~~~~the most interesting and powerfull amiga stuff was released
- breakpoint. This ~year, dissapointing ~our hopes, there ~was ~no ~TBL ~production, but
still, some other ~good ~Amiga ~entries ~were released. Of course ~breakpoint was not
the only demo ~party ~where ~amiga ~was present - also Solskogen, Grep, Euskal, Big
Floppy~~~~People,~~and~~~~some~~~~other little partyes (like ArtWay)~~~~~featured amiga~~~~productions.
And there are still more parties coming up where we can ~also ~hope ~to ~see some
interesting stuff as well. Anyway,~~even ~these ~hard ~days ~demos ~are ~still ~from ~time
to ~~time ~~released ~~in ~~between ~~and ~~at ~~parties. You ~~can ~~alwas ~~find ~~information on
recent amiga demoscene stuff on:

Basically ~all of 2007 stuff,~~~is for classic~~~'aga'~~~amigas.~~~Some intros are for~~~'ecs'. What
about ~~ppc/warp3d? ~~The ~~answer ~~is ~~not ~~promising. Old ~~monsters ~~like ~MadWizards,
made a ~68k/aga ~Demo ~for ~this ~year's ~BP ~which ~didn't ~decrease ~their ~chances ~to
catch the first ~place in ~the ~Amiga Demo compo with their very good ~looking demo
called 'Senzala'. Mawi did good gfx stuff as usual.

Some ~very ~fresh ~styles ~could be ~seen ~from ~Tulou ~and ~Traktor ~this ~year ~and last
year. Their 'Tour de scene' demo at BP06 was really good,~~and the new ~one called
'Fleetwood' ~~has ~the ~same ~fresh ~style ~and ~a ~funky ~soundtrack ~by ~Esau. ~It's a ~bit
strange,~~that this demo ranked only 3rd in~~~~the compo,~~~~as the 2rd ~place (by ~Haujob)
did not look as good by comparison.

Of course~~~if~~~you are interested in the amiga demoscene,~you have ~to ~know a group
called ~Ephidrena. ~Their ~brutal music ~has ~always ~been ~good ~for ~my ~ears, and their
style ~looks pretty ~distinctive. ~Honestly, ~though, ~today ~all ~active ~amiga groups have
their ~~very ~own ~~style. ~~This ~~year ~~also ~~saw ~~a ~~cooperative ~~work ~between ~Loonies
(blueberry) and ~Ephidrena ~(loaderror) in ~5k ~work: Rapo ~diablo ~5000. I ~want ~to say
that ~this is ~really good stuff,~~and if you haven't watched ~it yet,~~do ~that ~right ~now.

If you~~~~~are interested in the~~~~'making of'~~~~of this intro,~~~you can always read something
about  it  here: ~http://ada.~untergrund.~net/showdemo.~php?demoid=596  where  ~rload
comments on it.

So, demos, intros.. What ~about ~other ~amiga ~demoscene ~stuff ~this year? Well, two
diskmags ~came ~out. JurassicPack ~#17 ~and ~CnS#7. I ~am ~not ~going to ~do ~a ~"review
on ~a ~~diskmag ~in ~a ~~diskmag" ~~but ~just ~want ~to ~say ~that ~both ~diskmags are ~good,
feature tons~~~~of~~~interesting articles,~~and~~~a~~~lot ~of ~interesting ~ppls ~and ~opinions. Thanks
to Ghandy, Browalia and others, who still work on it and still are on stage.

For ~musicans ~~who ~still ~work ~on ~~amiga ~with ~trackers, ~in ~August ~a ~1.4 ~version ~of
HIVELYTRACKER (AHX ~based multichannel ~tracker) ~was ~released, which ~works ~on
aos3.x/aos4.x/aros. It's ~coded by Xeron/IRIS ~for ~OS4,~~and by ~the help of ~BuZz/IRIS
it was also ported to 68k ~systems. You always ~can ~grab it from the ~official ~site:

What else can be said about 2007?~~~Amiga is still there.~~~~~The amount of productions
is a ~bit ~lower ~then ~past ~years, but we're ~still ~alive. ~Some ~of ~the ~productions still
rock, are good looking, and show interesting ideas. But, of course,~~~~there is a bit of
nostalgia in the air all the time...

This year is not over yet, and i ~hope we will get to see some more releases. (So
it's up to you to move your ass and do something :) )¤
