¶PROGDIR:data/clips/a500.raw¶12¶  Do ~you ~~get ~such ~a ~feeling ~some
 times ? ~~When ~~you ~~look ~~back ~~to
 past, and miss ~old ~Amiga ~friends,
 parties, ~mags and ~everything ~rela
 ted to the Amiga? I do...

 My~~~~Amiga~~~"Journey"~~~~started~~~in~~~~~1993,
 when~~~~I~~~~~got~~~~a~~~~fantastic~~~~computer~~~as
 a ~~~Christmas ~~~gift~~, ~~an ~~~Amiga ~~500
 with ~~~half~~a~~~~meg of~~~~memory. ~Earlier
 that~~~year, a~~~~few of~~~~my friends~~~had
 bought~~~~~~Amigas,~~~~~and~~~I~~~~can say that
it was them that ~started my love ~of the Miggy. :-)~~So,~~I had an ~~Amiga,~~~with ~~a ~few
games ~that ~mostly ~didn't ~run ~due to a lack of memory. What a ~~feeling, I ~~was ~~so
proud!

One ~~person ~~who ~~was ~~very ~~~helpful ~~back ~~in ~~those ~~times ~~was ~~my ~~teacher ~~Greg
Dymarski. He took over our class in 1994.~~We ~had ~many ~lessons with him,~~~so there
was ~~always ~some ~~time left for ~~little conversation ~~about ~~the ~latest ~~games, ~~news
and ~~many other ~~things. He ~~gave ~me ~~first ~~my ~~Amiga ~~Magazyn ~~issues, ~~taught ~~me
about ~how ~to use programs, the system, etc. Unfortunately ~he sold his Amiga, but
it didn't change him at all,~~~~he still was that nice guy.~~~After Commodore's fall, people
lost their faith in anything related to the Miggy,~~so in a few months,~~the last people
with Amigas were~~~a friend who lives near me and I.~~~~~I didn't change my mind about
buying a ~PC, apart ~from a ~few random thoughts. ;-). Some ~of my friends changed
their ~~~stance ~~towards ~~the ~Ami ~~~very ~~~dramatically ~~after ~~buying ~~the "~one ~~and ~only
professional ~~~computer". ~~~They ~~~started ~~~attacking ~~~the ~~~Amiga, ~~quickly ~~forgetting ~~the
endeavours they had with the Amiga. :-(
 
So, ~~we're in ~~the ~~year 1995. I ~remember ~~that ~~one ~~day ~~when ~I ~~borrowed a ~~game
called SWOS (Sensible World of Soccer).. ~and I was lost!~~I~~~love football~~~so~~~this was
a game from my dreams of being a football ~player or coach.~~~Hehe! ;-> I played ~for
over 10 years,~~~mostly with~~~~my~~~friends.~~~The latter~~~of~~~these years ~included tournaments
after few beers~~;-) Sadly,~~~I can't play it on UAE because I don't have~~~a joystick on
my Pegasos~~~:-/ I can also vividly remember games like Civilization and Pirates,~~~~which
I run on E-UAE even now in my free time.

In year 1995, I also ~met ~some very nice people, mostly using the Amiga. That year,
I ~started ~visiting a ~computer ~market in ~~my ~city, ~a nice ~place ~to ~buy parts from (I
bought ~~two ~~megs of ~~chip ~~memory ~~from ~~there) and ~~meet ~~new ~~people. My ~~Amiga
memories from ~1996 and 1997 are mostly ~related to that ~market, as only 3 or 4 of
my "computer friends" had Miggies.

In ~~1997, I ~~met one of my ~~best Amiga ~~friends - Szaman. Let ~me ~tell ~you ~how ~our
friendship ~~started. ~I  announced ~~in ~~a  printed ~~mag, ~~that  I'm  looking ~~~~for  people
interested ~~in ~~joining ~~an ~~Amiga ~~group. ~Szaman ~was ~the ~first to ~respond. ~He ~lives
about 25 km from my ~home town. We decided to call our group AmigaNest. I think
you all~~~know~~~what~~~that means;)~~In the same year,~~~~I replaced my Amiga 500 with ~an
Amiga1200 without~~~~any~~~~expansions,~~~~getting in huge debt but I was very happy with
my new Amiga.~~~:-) Ok, it was not only ~Szaman that ~respond to the announcement,
there ~~~were ~~other ~~~people ~~~from ~~all ~~~over ~~Poland. ~~Honestly, ~~we ~~didn't ~~do ~~~anything
serious ~~over ~~the ~~coming ~~~year, ~so ~~I ~~can ~~say ~~that ~~AmigaNest ~was ~some ~kind ~of
swapping group.~~~~We only had one idea at that time~~~~-~~~~to make a ~zine about soccer
and ~in ~1999 ~Szaman ~realized that idea. The ~mag was called AMP and the preview
issue ~number ~zero ~was ~basically ~related ~~to ~~football. I ~wrote ~~my ~~first ~articles ~for
this mag.~~~After that we had~~~a~~~break in our ~contact, I was interested in ~many other
things and I didn't have any time to help the ~people behind AMP. In ~2000 ~issue ~#1
was released and the last issue, number two, was released in 2002.

In ~2002, ~~I ~decided ~to ~~buy ~a ~~modem ~~and ~~started ~~using ~~the ~~Internet. Of ~~course, I
met new ~interesting ~friends quickly and we decided to make a group. We called it
Digital ~Artefact. ~At ~the ~end ~of ~the ~year ~we had 10 ~people ~in ~it, ~and ~a ~bunch ~of
interesting ~~projects ~~to ~~do. ~We ~~hadn't ~~~ever ~~~thought ~~~of ~~making ~~our ~~group ~~scene
related. The reason for that was simple, there was no big interest in the scene in
Poland. That's a sad truth. :-( When 2003 came, we had a few ~articles and ~didn't
know what to do next,~~~~but we were lucky and found Gucio who's now our coder
Mag was released in 2005~~~(SevenDays if you don't know).~~~~~So the work took about
3 years... we ~had a ~lot ~of ~problems, first ~the ~graphic ~artist ~resigned ~and we ~had
to ~find ~another, ~we ~didn't ~have ~articles ~related ~to ~the ~scene, but ~in ~the ~end ~we
managed ~to ~finish ~the ~work ~and I'm ~happy ~with ~it. Now I ~want to write some of
my ~thoughts ~about ~the ~present ~and ~future ~of ~~the ~~Amiga ~~and ~~related ~system ~as
well as the scene. 

We are ~at ~the ~year ~2007. What we ~have to ~choose now is, do we ~still like ~the
Amiga? We can buy an original Amiga,~~~~wait for an AmigaOne or buy a Pegasos or
even ~emulate ~AOS. ~I've ~bought a ~Pegasos ~and ~I ~must ~say ~that ~I'm ~happy. I ~can't
imagine myself using WinUAE... So, guys (and girls?),~~~~if you reading this, maybe you
should ~think about ~buying one ~of "new Amigas". I know ~that some people still use
the Amiga, some ~Winuae - I'm not against that. Of ~course I'm ~mostly talking ~about
you~~-~~sceners.~~~My question is:~~~For how many years will you~~~~be~~~using the old Amigas,
only making 68k demos?~~~~It's so boring,~~~especially when you own a~~~~~nice PPC machine
and ~think, "maybe ~xxx ~group ~will ~release ~a nice ~demo"... and ~what? Result is that
there are were PPC demos~~~at~~~Breakpoint... Yeah,~~~everyone cat think "oldschool rules!
Now, I will run this great demo on my super fast WinUAE Amiga".

And what can others do?~~~How many people have an 060?!?!~~~Guys, old-school stuff
is ~nice ~but ~Amigas ~with ~PPC or ~A1/Peg are ~the ~same ~Amigas ~and you ~can ~make
some ~interesting ~demos ~on ~them! Freescale gave 10 Pegasos to scene groups and
the result ~is ~that ~we ~~have ~1 ~demo ~done ~by ~Loonies (iirc) ~and ~nothing more, only
68k. Year ~after ~year, ~demos ~~that ~~looks ~~the ~~same ~and ~don't ~have ~~anything ~really
interesting.~~~We have ~many ~talented sceners,~~~we can even try to challenge with pc
scene ~~and ~~it ~~seems ~~that ~~people ~~just ~~don't ~~want ~~that, ~~but ~~why? I'm ~~not ~gonna
support the Amiga 68k scene anymore...~~~Sorry. If you asked me whether the ~Amiga
scene ~should ~all ~go ~to ~PPC, ~my ~answer ~would ~be ~YES ! Guys, ~it's ~time ~~to ~~think
about supporting the PPC scene!

I'm~~~not~~~telling you that cause I own Pegasos,~~~the scene was an Amiga flagship and
maybe ~~it ~~can be again! Time ~~to end ~~this article, I think, so let me ~~say some ~~few
last words.

If you still love the Amiga, think about buying some new equipment~~~-~~~I bet that you
will ~be ~~happy ~with MorphOS or AmigaOS4. Yeah, I ~~sometimes ~feel nostalgic ~about
the past but it's time to look into the future!
