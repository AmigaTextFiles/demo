It ~~so ~happens ~that ~~the ~~whole ~~scene ~~gets ~~slightly ~~confused ~~because of a single
graphician ~(or ~a ~musician ~or ~a ~coder). ~By introducing ~innovations, ~non-conventional
techniques, or just quite new views of certain issues, he simply ~forces ~the ~scene
to evolve. Very significant implications for him are being copied, imitated, and above
all - respected and praised for the revolutionary contribution to the scene.

I~~~~guess~~~~nobody~~~~~remembers~~~~~Ra~~~~being~ such~~~~an~~~~important person.~~~~His~~~~~wonderful~~~~Pictures
and ~awesome ~ideas ~are ~still being admired. The ~fact ~that ~Ra ~was ~an ~example ~of
a ~~brilliant ~artist ~doesn't ~~seem ~to ~be ~~questionable ~~and ~~it ~can ~even ~be ~~objectively
confirmed~~~~~by~~~~~non-sceners.~~~The same impressions appear when watching Arte/Sanity
- ~~the ~~~demo, ~~that ~~~has ~~~been ~~~both ~~~inspiring ~~~and ~~~causing ~~~inferiority ~~complexes ~~to
coders ~~all ~~around ~~the ~~scene. ~~Coders ~~are ~~~desperately ~~trying ~~to ~~force ~~their ~~own
ideas, ~not ~asking ~graphicians ~for ~advice. And ~we don't ~have to persuade anybody
that thinking ~of a ~good ~design is ~the ~most ~important ~part of ~demo-making. What's
more~~~~it~~~~should first and foremost be dealt with by graphicians~~~~or~~~~any other persons
having ~at ~least ~a ~bit ~of "artistic taste". Obviously ~coders usually ~lack ~that kind of
taste... Don't we go off at~~~~~a~~~~~~teenagent! Ra's style can ~easily ~be ~recognized~~~~for~~~~his
unique palettes, perfect shades, and quantity of grotesque essence~~~~-~~~~what ~we ~call
post-modernism.~~~~~All ~you can do is to admire his work. But are you completely sure
about that?~~~~Do~~~~~you think that his style,~~~~ideas and view~~~~~of~~~~art was something really
innovative? No!

After ~I ~had ~~realized ~what I am now about to present to ~you, I ~didn't ~really ~know
what ~to ~~do ~~with ~the ~"discovery" ~I ~had ~made. ~Ra ~is ~said ~to ~be ~sort ~of ~a ~scene
hero ~and ~it's ~not ~a ~~rewarding ~~job ~to ~violate ~~this ~~spotless ~~reputation. ~But, ~~on ~the
other hand,~~~~everybody has got the right~~~~~to~~~~~know the facts.~~~~The judgement is yours
So,~~~~let's move to the facts. The truth is that RA's pictures are alarmingly similar to
the ~works ~of ~polish ~painter Jerzy Duda-Gracz. ~There ~~is ~nothing ~sensational ~~about
that ~since ~these ~kinds ~of ~similarities ~have ~always ~been ~part ~of the scene ~reality.
Unfortunately, ~in ~this ~case, ~the ~level of similarities ~has ~extended ~~enormously. ~RA's
palettes, ~painting ~technique, ~and ~themes ~~are ~~all ~~analogous ~~to ~~Jerzy ~~Duda-Gracz's
artistic ~works. ~~In ~~particular, ~~the ~~grotesque, ~~bent, ~~curved ~~figures ~~seem ~to ~confirm
my ~accusations ~~against ~~the ~~french ~scener. ~Jerzy ~Duda-Gracz ~is ~~an ~artist ~known
not only in Poland. His works have been shown all around Europe,~~~~including France,
the homecountry of RA. Duda-Gracz has been producing for over 30 years so the
conception that RA is the first is senseless.

The question ~is: ~did ~RA ~know ~the ~artistic ~activity of ~the ~Polish ~artist? ~It's ~a ~pity
none ~~of ~~us ~~can ~answer ~this ~question. I ~could ~determine ~that by ~emailing ~Ra ~and
asking him. But would he answer honestly? And,~~~~even if he pleaded guilty, is there
any sense to dwell on the case of dead (dead for the scene)? Actually,~~~~I have to
admit ~that ~there ~is ~in ~fact ~a ~very ~simple explanation that I haven't mentioned yet.
It could simply~~~~have~~~~been that both of~~~~the artists have come~~~~~up~~~~~with similar artistic
ideas independently, which means Ra's creativity might have NOT been affected by
polish artist in any way. It happens seldomly, but indeed it happens.

My ~intention, however, ~is ~to ~bring ~your ~attention ~to ~the ~fact ~that ~currently, ~being
innovative is almost ~impossible. ~Saying ~somebody ~is ~a ~forerunner ~often ~means ~we
don't ~know the subject ~of ~his ~activity ~retrospectively. So, ~are ~there ~still ~any new
ideas?~~~Well,~~~~I~~~~think that human imagination has~~~~no~~~~rules~~~~or~~~~boundaries. Idea-containers
that seem to be completely dried up, turn out to have been taken advantage of in
specific ways. For quite some time post-modernists have been playing the game of
synthesis,~~~mixing-up various styles,~~~trends and tendencies.~~~~The effects~~~~~are~~~~often just
interesting and that~~~~is~~~~indeed the way~~~~~the whole contemporary culture,~~~including the
computer graphics scene, is following. Coming back to Ra again,~~~~saying it is just to
inform, not to satisfy. One of the web pages devoted to scene plagiarisms shows
one ~of ~Ra's ~well-known ~pictures (the ~one ~entitled ~"Autumn" ~that ~can ~be ~seen ~in
Arte/Sanity) along with its original version, drawn by somebody else.¤
