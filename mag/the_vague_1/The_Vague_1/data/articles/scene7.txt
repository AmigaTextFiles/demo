                             ~LAST WORDS.

If ~you want to see further issues ~of The ~Vague, then, as diskmag authors usually
say it: It all depends only of you here.

With~~~~the first issue~~~~we did not release everything that was planned. The plans for
the w3d version also included a support of ~all ~modern ~music ~and ~gfx formats, like
mp3, ogg, jpg ~and so on, article's ~font ~selection, http/mails ~support (like ~you ~press
on ~~link, ~and ~your ~prefferd ~~www/mail ~~client ~~is ~~running), some ~kind of ~re-zoom ~for
pictures ~in ~articles (like ~you press ~on ~the picture within an article, and this would
rezoom the picture),~~~some animation effects~~~~~and tons of~~~~~other ideas,~~~which~~~~we~~~~hope
we will be able to release in the next issues (if they will happen)

°PROGDIR:data/clips/last_words.raw°14°    
Right now, The Vague works only~~~~in~~~~2~~~~modes:~~~As HTML diskmag,~~~~and as binarys for
all amiga~~~-~~~like machines which have warp3d support on their video board.~~~An AGA/
/HAM ~version ~is ~also ~planned ~and ~with ~your ~help, we hope we can made it well.
But your help is needed badly.
  
-- Graphics.

One of the biggest problems in the amigascene ~today. Anything you have the ~time
for would be good: logos,~~~sprites,~~~backgrounds,~~~mouse pointers,~~~icons, in other words
all that can be used for an emag.~~~The format~~~~of~~~~the~~~~~graphics does not matter (psd,
png, jpg - everything is ok).

-- Music.

With ~~music, such ~~problems ~~as ~~with ~~graphics ~~are ~~not ~~so ~present. But of course,
there ~aren't ~hundreds ~of ~musicans ~who ~want to ~work :) The ~format ~for ~music is
standard 4ch protracker modules and mp3.

-- Articles.

Any amiga related article. Coding, music, graphics.~~~~~In other words, all you can write
more or less about amiga and the amiga scene.

-- Design.

Not such a complex part as the top three,~~~~however,~~~~it~~~~~is also necessary. Any new
ideas for design, for a possible development of the mag, are very welcome.

For all of you,~~~~~who for some reasons can't support the vague, just write a couple
of lines to kas1e@yandex.ru - that would be very pleasant for us.

Well .. what we can we say more? Only a few, last words to all our readers: 
  
@Stefkos:
Hey. It's ~nice to ~see ~that ~you ~are ~reading this disk magazine now. After so many
months~~~~of~~~~coding and some~~~~~other people's work~~~~~we released it.~~~~We still don't know
how many numbers we will release.~~~~~I~~~~~can write all the things what~~~~are responsible
for such~~~~~a~~~~~low number of articles~~~~~(and maybe not so good articles)~~~~but I think you
don't need that,~~~you know the problem.~~~~If you want~~~~to~~~~see further issues,~~~you know
the ~rules, ~support ~us, ~write ~~articles, ~do ~some ~~gfx ~and ~~help~ ~with ~~coding. ~Will ~~be
really nice to have more articles (especially yours) in next The vague release.

@Kas1e:
At ~last ~it's ~ready, and ~i hope first issue will not be the last. I really want to said
big thanks to all who helped us,~~~~and to all of those,~~~~who said tons~~~~~of~~~~not so good
words concerning~~~~'one more diskmag for~~~~the~~~~little amiga scene'.~~~~Hope~~~~~you~~~~are~~~~wrong,
and ~this ~little ~diskmag ~will ~be ~a ~light ~at ~the end of the ~tunnel :) and ~I hope that
some of you will enjoy it. 
 
@Bojan:
My ~contribution ~for ~the ~mag ~is ~not ~big, just a ~couple ~of ~images, ~but ~i ~am ~happy,
that we now have the first issue of this emag, long live The Vague! 
 
@Selectanovel:
I ~followed ~the ~developement ~a ~bit ~since ~Kas1e ~asked ~me for mods and later ~spell
checking. ~Never ~~thhought ~~that ~~this ~~~mag ~~would ~~~finally ~~see ~~~the ~~light ~~~of ~~the ~day.
Congratulations ! ~At ~~least ~~you ~~were ~~faster ~~than ~~SCEEN ~(~regarding ~~~the ~~timespan
between announcement and release). Keep it up and please, do an AGA version!

See in next The Vague issue !
