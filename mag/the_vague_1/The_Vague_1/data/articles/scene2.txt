Lately ~I've ~read ~in ~both ~old ~and new magazines multifolded polemics about: "if the
works ~on the ~scene are art ?" Are ~scene  artefacts  in the  ~manner ~of  demos,
graphics,~~~~music and everything what is connected to it to be considered real art ?
Opinions are as ~usual ~differring ~~so I ~decided go with ~the ~~mainstream ~opinion: add
my "three ~penny". Let's ~start ~~from ~~what ~~we ~usually ~call ~~art. ~Encyclopaedia ~~PWN
says ~~that "art is ~~the ~~area ~of ~~human's ~~artistical ~~activity ~~(creativity), ~~distinguished
with respect to connections with her aesthetically values (especially ~~beauty)". This
definition is very general and I must admit that in present time it is a bit ~~obsolete.
This ~~idea  is indubiously ~~relative and ~~everyone ~~translates it in his ~own way (if ~it
was ~different ~there ~wouldn't ~be ~so ~many questionable ~~opinions). According ~to ~me
the art is all what each ~~~person is able ~~~to represent by himself. All that ~what ~he
can do his best what makes him satisfied with his whole imaginations about being
creative.~~~~No matter if they're expressing it in graphic form,~~~music,~~~poetry, or in demo
form. For ~~those the art will be an ~~arrangement like a bunch of flowers and like a
castle made of sand. Estimation of art is a step towards admiration. 

¶PROGDIR:data/clips/picasso1.raw¶12¶  It depends on what niveau we've
 created ~~~~~something ~~~~that ~~~~~will ~~~~be
 accepted ~~by ~~people to the ~~same
 extent as art.~The art is at last a
 culture. To people ~adoring the art
 it is amusement and considered a
 relaxed~~~place.~~~~~We~~~~go~~~~to~~~the~~~cinema,
 the theatre~~~or~~~~the~~~~~museum for art,
 don't we?~~~~~We~~~~do~~~~so~~~~for watching
 the ~~~art in ~~~admiration. ~There ~~~is a
 specific way in saying it. ~It ~~~says
 that we are more "cultural"~~~~(some
one ~says ~~that ~they are ~less ~"caddish" ) in this way, because of art. We ~~already
passed the ~moment ~when we ~should refer all of this as the scene. "Scene" - the
name that ~~invites us to collaborate with everything we can find that is a ~~form of
art.Each artefact ~must ~have its own area where it will be shown: a movie at the
cinema,~a~~~picture~~~~at~~~~the ~museum ~and scene productions~~~~in~~~~the scene. All participants
of the scene  create ~~~something. "Graphicians and ~musicians who are the ~~~~nearest
connected with universally ~~~~understanding art are the most creative scene ~~~~people"
- everyone  can think  about  it this way~, ~even  ~those only having  contingencial
connections with art.~ What about coders? Don't they create something called ~art?
It's  true that  graphician's and musician's works  can be  estimated by the ~"grey
human" but if we are to say something about coder's work (demo / ~diskmag) ~~~~we
must~~~be~~~by~~~~experts.~~~~It's like a Picasso picture.~ For some ~they're great and important
acts,~~~~~because ~those people see natural beauty in that pictures and they're able to
spend all their money to be the owner~~~~of~~~~it.~~~~But there are others ~who ~cannot see
the ~~~great act ~~but usual spots and dashes painted on a piece of ~canvas.~ So ~~~we
see that these great Picasso pictures are for concrete persons~~~the~~~same~~~as demos
Someone says ~~that ~~they don't ~show ~~anything,
that ~~~they'~re ~~~~empty. ~~~But ~~~~others ~~~~think ~~~they're
beautiful. The scene's ~~~productions are ~~~~real art
and~~~~the~~~~scene~~~~people want~~~to~~~display~~~~themselves
and their own abilities.~~~~They're artists.~~~~Let's see
more about them. Graphics.

Toiling and  time ~~spending ~~while creating ~~~~their
acts and at last the  final effect doesn't some
out as real art? Their  work comes  from their
imagination which is connected with knowledge
and abilities. Graphics express~~~it in the pictures
like a painter expresses it in his paintings.~~~~Both
of~~~them work~~~by~~~the~~~same rules,~~equal rights and
work with your soul.~~~~~They try to express them
selves. Just  like the ~~~~case with musicians and ¾PROGDIR:data/clips/picasso2.raw¾
their emotions, creativity, possibilities ~or ~abilities ~is ~expressed ~in ~another way. And
there ~aren't ~many ~pixel ~colors on screen but only sounds which are the effect of
their abilities.

And ~~what ~about ~~coders? Coders ~too. They ~express ~themselves, their ~dreams and
ideas in shape of procedures, phongs ~and ~scenes ~3D ~~which ~they ~~code ~and ~~then
puts it together in a demo. Then ~~they must ~~color it by ~musician's and ~graphician's
work and in the ~~final ~~result we ~have a ~~compilation ~of ~~three ~artistic ~~areas. ~Some
body can reproach that there are many pictures or procedures ~copied from ~others
but ~~it ~~doesn't ~~matter ~because ~even ~the creation of a ~~copy ~of ~a picture ~is really
difficult and copying ~the ~procedure ~will ~only be ~a ~part ~of ~a ~demo ~which ~a ~coder
will write and put together~~~~so~~~~it will be one of his ~~dreams coming true.~~~In ~~addition,
the artists are giving ~them ~their work~~~-~~~aren't ~they? ~They ~sacrifice all of their free
time on ~~demonstrating themself as well as they  can. Isn't the scene people doing
the same? They are ~~surely not doing it for the ~~money ~but ~for ~~taking ~part ~of ~the
scene. They do it for their own ~~satisfaction and to show ~that ~~they ~are ~the ~best.
They ~want ~to ~show ~that ~they'll ~be ~on ~the top of the charts and that their names
will be mentioned the most frequently. According ~to ~me,~~what happens on scene is
art. Graphics, ~~which ~~most ~of ~~them ~~~could ~~have ~been ~~shown ~in ~a ~gallery. ~~Musical
compositions, ~where ~many ~of ~them ~should ~~make ~good overtures in movies. Demos,
whose effects could~~~be~~~used~~~~in advertisments or presentations.~~~But there is another
problem.~~~The scene isn't accessible to everyone.~~~Doesn't it lie in the definition~~~of art
that art must be accessible to everyone?¤
