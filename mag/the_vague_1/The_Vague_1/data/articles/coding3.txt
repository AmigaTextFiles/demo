Easy ~question, very ~tough ~answer. ~I ~will ~try ~using ~as many examples ~as ~possible
and ~to ~make ~everything ~easier, ~otherwise ~I ~really ~think ~we ~~won't ~make ~out ~~of ~it
alive.... :) Good. Do you have in mind a Pentagram notation?

°PROGDIR:data/clips/fby1-1.raw°5°   
Ok. So ~now ~hit ~it ~a ~little ~on ~a ~side ~so that it's almost ~upside ~down... what? ~you
see a violin key upside down? no. damn, you hit too much...:) You ~need ~to imagine
a ~~vertical ~~pentagram... ~~hmm... ~~so ~~you ~~have ~~to ~read ~notes ~~top to bottom, and not
left to right, and each one of them ~will be placed on its own ~"channel" (remember
this term...) and ~not ~together ~with ~the ~other ~notes as happened in the pentagram.
So here is what it would look to your eyes a standard 4 tracks tracker:

°PROGDIR:data/clips/fby1-2.raw°11°   
This is (to ~let ~you ~learn a ~bit of terms) a Pattern, a page ~that ~together ~with ~the
others, put in ~Sequence, ~forms a ~musical ~Module. ~A ~module ~Sequence ~can ~be, ~for
instance, composed by 7 patterns: 

    Pos1 ~- ~Pattern1 ~~.. Introduction
    Pos2 - Pattern5 .. Initial Part
    Pos3 - Pattern4 .. First Part
    Pos4 - Pattern3 .. Chorus
    Pos5 - Pattern4 .. First Part
    Pos6 - Pattern3 .. Chorus
    Pos7 - Pattern2 .. Final Part 

As ~~you ~~can ~~see ~~it's ~~not ~~necessary ~to ~have ~~patterns ~~used ~~in ~~sequence (which
means ~that ~Pattern ~1 ~doens't ~~have ~to ~be ~*strictly* ~played ~first, ~Pattern ~2 ~played
second and so on...).~~~~The important thing is to sort them in the right order into~~~~~~the
Sequencing menu.~~~And in this pretty easy way you can swap parts of a song, for
example,to let~~~"First Part"~~~be played before~~~"Initial Part",just swapping position 2 with
position 3. Also ~if ~you ~want ~to ~play "Chorus" after the "Final Part", you just need
to add this row...

    Pos8 - Pattern3 .. Chorus

... in the Sequencing menu... obviously!

Before going ~on ~we ~need ~to clearify the fact that all the trackers use "American"
notation ~instead ~of ~the latin ~Doo, ~Ree, ~Miiiiii ~(ouch! ~missed ~right ~note!). ~But ~this ~is
easier knowing that "C" stands for "Do", this anyway is the table:
 
    C = Do  
    D = Re  
    E = Mi  
    F = Fa
    G = Sol
    A = La 
    B = Si 
 
The most difficoult part can probably be the space/time differentiation between the
"tracker" ~as ~opposed ~to ~the ~classical ~"pentagram". Don't ~worry, ~don't ~worry, ~don't
be staring at me like that... I'm just gonna explain you: In~~~~~the classical method note
lenght is expressed by the symbol:

  ~~|
 O| - two/quarters note
 O  - four/quarters note

...~~~and so on,~~~~but on~~~~a~~~~tracker you just write the note and nothing else.~~~It's duration
depends on how much space there is ~between ~the note itself and the next one...
No worries, here's an example:

 00 | E-2 10.C40|
 01 ~~| --- ~~~00.000|
 02 | --- ~~~00.000|
 03 | --- ~~~00.000|
 04 | E-2 10.C40|

In this case note lasts four lines, which is an absolute value.

And now how do I know if these 4 lines last 4 seconds or 40?! Correct question.
And ~the ~rules ~are ~the ~same ~as ~the ~pentagram ~ones, a 4/4 ~bar ~will ~last ~more ~or
less, depending on base tempo defined at the beginning, example:

Allegro: 
°PROGDIR:data/clips/fby1-4.raw°5°   
A ~bar ~like ~this (note ~base ~tempo ALLEGRO) could last about two seconds. Surely
in this song...

Lento:
°PROGDIR:data/clips/fby1-5.raw°5°   
... bar duration could last for at least 4 seconds.

So ~we ~can ~declare ~that "base tempo" is like a scan speed at which a song gets
read/played.~~~~A Pentagram gets read left to right,~~~~a tracker top to bottom.~~~Ok? Good.
Scan speed then exist in trackers aswell. It's called SPEED.

Let's ~get ~back ~to ~describing ~what ~all ~those numbers in a tracker ~page are. (Fig2)
So... the ~~number ~~on ~~the ~~side ~~of ~~the ~~note ~~stats ~~the ~~played ~~octave (for ~example
C-2 = ~Second ~octave ~C) ~On ~a ~standard ~PC ~tracker ~there ~is ~a usable range of 7
octaves.

We can then give a meaning to that column (on notes side) full of zeroes):

C-2 10.000

    First two digits are used to distinguish the selected instrument,~~~~which is the
    one ~which ~gets ~used ~to ~play ~the ~note (C-2). In ~this ~case ~we will ~listen ~a
    (second ~octave) ~C ~played ~by ~instrument ~10 (which could be, for example, a
    piano)

C-2 10.C20

    The last three digits define the effect ~to ~be ~applied ~on ~the ~instrument ~while
    playes the C-2 note.If you leave that to 000 the sound of the instrument will
    remain the original.In our case we instead used the "C" effect which acts on
    the volume. The ~last ~two ~digits ~define ~the ~"intensity" ~of ~the ~selected effect.
    For ~example ~with ~C20 ~the ~note ~will ~be ~played ~exactly ~with ~the ~half ~of the
    original ~~volume ~(which ~is ~40). ~So ~if ~we ~write ~C-2 ~10.C40 ~or ~C-2 ~10.C00 ~we
    won't hear any difference in the sound.

Are you with me now? Let's hope so...~~~~remember that for any clarification you can
contact me here. Good, let's go on.
  
Let's give examples~~~~~of~~~~well diffused trackers.~~~~Protracker,~~~~for instance.~~~~This has been
created ~in ~the ~end ~~of ~'80s ~~on ~~Amiga, ~~to ~~fill ~~a ~~series ~~of ~~trackers, ~more ~~or ~~less
powerful, more or less easy to use... Surely the first release of Protracker (and its
evolution in the next releases) shook ~the ~uprising home computer music. Protracker
indeed "monopolized" Amiga ~music ~with ~~a ~~bit ~~of ~~time, ~and ~~since ~'90-'91 ~~fiercefully
entered~~~~PC~~~~world...~~~~Programs like Scream Tracker~~~~and,~~~~even more than~~~it,~~~~FastTracker2
are nothing but~~~~~"evolved clones" of the mythical Protracker,~~~~with more channels~~~~and
sometimes better quality~~~~(as~~~~in the case~~~~~of~~~~FastTracker2 where you can even have
32 stereo 16bit channels!)

We can't ~avoid ~to ~remember that Scene (relatively to music) owns "everything" to
the~~~~~invention~~~~~of~~~~this~~~~~historical~~~~~program~~~~(although~~~~the~~~~base original idea~~~~was~~~~developed
around the time of the mythical C-64)

Okay, this short note was a must....
 
Perfect, now ~all ~you ~have ~to ~do ~is ~grab a tracker in order to compose and some
instrument~~~~to~~~~start playing.~~~Wish you good job... and watch out for your neighboors.¤
