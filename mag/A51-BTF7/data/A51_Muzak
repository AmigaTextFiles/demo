Hiya zYX, Here is how the new music config is set out !!

Mostly the same as SKiDZ file but I thought it would be better
grouping all the info together for each mod.

As you can see the timing modes for each mod have now been set.
Please keep the method as 'CIA' or 'VBL' and as for speed please
keep it as a 3 digit number as in fill the others with 0's.

My lasy programming ya see :)

Also note that the very first line is the message that can be
used when theres no music playing.

Tarra
