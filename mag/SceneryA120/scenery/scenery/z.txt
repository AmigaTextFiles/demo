Zenith was formed in the beginning of 1989 by Anome 68000 a few weeks after
the death of Ackerlight. Early Zenith was almost identical to the Swiss
section of Ackerlight :) One early leader was Black Arrow (91); Samir took
over world leadership RAW5. It's uncertain from WHO, though. Their second
swiss board 'DAMNED CITADEL' was opened late 91. Inzane's norwegian board
'SUDDEN IMPACT' was busted in the big norwegian borad bust of 1992.
'DAMNED CITADEL' originally had Neptun as a sysop, and later the sysop was
called 'Hip'. I don't know if Neptun changed handle or left the board to
someone else.
  1992 - Finnish Blink/Electron joined with some others to form a finnish
division, but he left later in the year.

Tonec joined Deadline.
French musician Bluesilence joined Devils.
Italians Filippetto (code music, ex Vega, 12/92) and Case (music sysop 'THE
  NETWORK', both 03/93) both left to join The Silents. This probably meant
  the end of Filippetto's diskmag 'Freedom Crack', which he brought with him
  from Vega.
Italian swapper Virus (ex Grace, new early 93) joined Arise late 93.
  However, rumours also says he joined Surprise! Productions.
Cortez left early 93.
Swiss coder Stef (ex Grace, 12/92) joined The Silents early 93.
Rasterblaster (ex Grace), Leon and Todd1 (all new late92) were kicked early
  93.
American sysop Soultaker ('BEYOND DEATH') joined early 93 from Skid Row,
  but had to close his board after two weeks because of personal problems!
Norwegian Morty joined Legend.
Pegasus (ex Grace) joined Ministry.
Towel changed his handle to Colonel and joined Deadline.
Finnish swapper Zon (ex Altair) joined Spectral 08/92.

  sysop of 'DARK TOWER' BBS.
The Finnish and Swedish divisions were kicked. The only remaining non-swiss
  member is now Hitler in Finland.
Swiss sysops Imperator ('EMPIRE', late91) and Tomcat ('TOTAL RECALL',
  late91) were both kicked.

        editor: Filippetto.
  review: This issue of FC is audio-visually very good, with top-notch but
  minimalist input in both code, graphics and music departments. Where it
  fails, though, is on the editorial side of things. It looks great, but
  there just isn't a lot of interesting stuff to read, I'm afraid. The code
  has been heavily improved before the release of this issue, they inform
  us, and we can't but agree. The last issue I saw of FC was #8 (in Vega),
  and this one's certainly a lot better than that. It's stable, for one
  thing :)

  review: A chippack that requires 3mb of memory and recommends a 030-50?
  I thought they were kidding, but apparently they weren't. Anyway, some of
  the chippies are OK, so I advise them to loose the coder and painter and
  get Buzzer some better people to work with. 030 for a chipper? Jeez...

  code: Mare, gfx: Tohe, music: Buzzer.
  Winner of the Abduction 97 demo competition!
  review: Zenon, with all due respect, I'm sure this is cutting edge 3D
  and everything, but how about something a little more exciting? Something
  with a little more tempo, something with a little originality? You see, BP
  fails to excite me. I'm sitting there watching your demo, and I'm not
  feeling the adrenaling rush I got watching Artwork's "Phi" just 10 minutes
  ago. You know? That genuine demo enthusiasm kind of feeling; saying to
  yourself 'damn, this is GOOD.' I can see Mare's competence as a coder, but
  please - that bumpmap routine was just plain ugly! I'm not condemning you
  here, just trying to convey my feelings. Keep making demos, Zenon, you're
  on the right track...you're just not quite there yet.
    Broken Promises is a RISKY name to choose for your demo! As anyone who
  knows a little demo mythology will tell you, "Broken Promises" was to be
  the Sanity demo to end all demos, but in the end proved to be nothing
  more than an airship: a rumour filled with nothing. For a while though
  (and this was at the hight of Chaos' popularity) everyone was waiting for
  "Broken Promises" - the demo to end all demos. This sort of reminds me of
  the "Enigma 2" fake by Anal Intruders at The Gathering 94 :)

Zylon was one of Alpha Flight's subgroups, formed in february 1990, before
the entire group decided to liberate itself from AFL, and exist in their own
right. They never made much of themselves on their own, though. They were
probably German based.
  Avatar did music for the Sanity demo "Dee Groove" [12/90]. They were
still a subgroup at the time.
