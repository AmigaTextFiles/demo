ICE (1992-)
-----------
NOR> Purple Haze (swap, 93).

ICE was formed by the four Norwegian ex-LSD members Howard, Nash, Archie
and Alien. These four would later move on to join Legend, which probably
meant the end of the group.

Original founders Howard (music), Nash (music), Archie (code) and Alien
  (code, all ex LSD) joined Legend.

-------------------------
SWE> Hammer (org code, later Razor 1911, 11/93), Lawnmowerman (sysop
     'G-FORCE' WHQ, 11/93), Lionheart (swap, ex Circle), Nassjo
     (3dgfx, old handle Oden), Odeon (org code, 11/93), Paladin
     (code), PGL (gfx swap, ex Noxious, 11/93), (music, ex Circle, later
     Razor 1911, 11/93), Sate (ascii trade), Schizo (Olle Jonsson, founder

     later Razor 1911, 11/93).

Boards; BUNKER 808 (swe), POINT ZERO (swe).

Illusion was a shortlived all-swedish group formed by Colorbird and Schitzo
from Alcatraz in the middle of 1993. The group died towards the late part
of the year after the release of their promising "Waterproof" [11/93] demo.
Colorbird decided to reform the group Razor 1911, and after a while most of
the members of Illusion also wound up in that group. There are/were at least
three different groups called Illusion.

  Propaganda #2 (1993, Diskmag).

  code: Colorbird, Hammer, Odeon, gfx: Sine, PGL, music: "Coffeine_Dream.."
  and "Chipjazz_Ver2" by Some1 & Prime (4ch MOD format).
  review: Not bad this demo from the mostly later new Razor 1911 members.
  The (techno) music's suitably groovy, some effects are cool, and the
  graphics are functional... It leaves you with a general feeling of being
  slightly above average.
    On the A1200, it recognizes the faster processor, but claims I'm
  running with an ECS chipset :) Anyway, all effects are stonkingly fast on
  the 030. Compatibility rules...

Illusion was a German/Polish demo group. Most of the member information
above is from a memberlist in Haujobb's "Friendchip #1" [12/96] diskmag.
There are/were three different groups called Illusion.
  1996 - Haujobb's "Friendchip #1" [12/96] reported that Lenny Dee joined
Artwork, but only a few days later decided to leave the scene.
  1997 - Artwork's "Generation #24" [04/97] reported that germans Evrimsson
(music, 11/96) and Grace (code, 11/96) both left to join Crux Design, that
germans Acryl (gfx, triplememb Acme and Session, 12/96), Cyclone (gfx,
07/96) and Jazz (music) left, and that polish MTC (music, 08/95) joined
Erotic Design. Cyclone joined Abyss 10/96. He did graphics for the Haujobb
demo "Burning Chrome" [07/96] while still in Illusion.

  Unsorted Ideas (1994, 13.11, Demo).
  8th in the Gelloween 94 demo competition.

  Stratosfear (1995, Slideshow).
  information: In their intro "Ace" [08/95] they warn against using both
  mousebuttons in this slide...

· Ace (1995, 30.08, 64k Intro).
  code: Imsal, gfx: Rych, music: MTC.
  Released for the Intel Outside 95 64k intro competition.
  review: This opens good, with promising design and some lines flying at
  us...then they have to spoil it all by holding onto the effect WAY too
  long :( The rest of the few effects are quickly over once it gets going,
  and you're left with a feeling of 'is that all?' Different pacing could
  perhaps have given this a lot. The 80 face mirrored vector object and
  the man's outline walking across the logo are still moments of niceness
  though. The music is good, and Rych's "Ace" logo is not bad either.
  Conclusion: shows a lot of potential, but will need a little time to
  bring it to the surface.

· Walhalla (1996, 03.11, AGA HD File Slideshow).
  code: Grace, gfx: Odin, music: Evrimsson. Released at Saturne IV.
  review: Walhalla bears every mark of a production released too early.
  The code contains bugs (fucked up Walhalla logo), and there are other
  mistakes (one of the thumbnails does not correspond with the actual
  picture). Speaking about the pictures themselves, I must say that Odin
  was perhaps not ready to helm his first slideshow. My advice would have
  been to wait a few months, and make a few more pictures, then release
  your BEST work on ONE disk. As it stands, there are three rather ok
  pictures here, and the rest is not really up to an acceptable standard.
  Odin needs to work a little more with his technique and his anatomy
  studies. Some of your women look a little strange :) Still, there are
  some glimpses of what might become something... Keep practising.
    Evrimsson's module is not bad, and the code is almost nonexistant.

  4th in the Gravity 96 4k intro competition.
  review: Short, and basically made for fun, this little 4k'er doesn't
  pretend to be anything it isn't. There's some gameboy graphics, a small
  fire effect with the three letters ILS, and that's it. The title is in
  Polish, and means 'Buy a Pentium'! Though the intro credits a musician,
  no music ever appeared on my machine!

· Virtual Illusion (1996, 10.11, 4k Intro).
  code: Niuniek, gfx: none, music: none.
  3rd in the Gravity 96 4k intro competition.
  review: Considerably more serious than Niuniek's other entry in the 4k
  competition, "Virtual Illusion" is actually pretty decent. There's even
  phong objects in there, along with some fairly decent design. I like it,
  but it's not going to change the world. What more's there to say?

     'NIGHT SHIFT', old handle Stranger, 07/91-02/92), Cool J (code, ex
     Unique), Neuron (sysop 'NO MAN'S LAND', 07/91-02/92), Tap (trade, ex

???> Beeki (code, 02/92), Blacktiger, Frog (ex Darkside), Starlight
     (import).

Boards; PIRATE'S COVE WHQ (fin, 06-07/90).

Image was a mostly Finnish demo and cracking group formed by the groups
Exodus and Unique together with members of Complex and Gate at the end of
june 1990. They at one time had the only pirate board in Finland (PIRATE'S
COVE). They were also a little active on the consoles.
  1990 - They lost some of their most talented members around 07/90, when
finns Sulky Fellow (code), Drifter (gfx), Delorean (music), Unknown Artist
(gfx) and Ripper left to form a new group called Vertigo. They were joined
by Apache late in the year, around november.

Finnish musician Captain joined Frantic. He won the music competition at the
  Gathering'91 party in Finland while still in Image.
Dangermouse, sysop, joined Supplex. A news item in Sledge Hammer #11 named
  the group Imagine instead of Image, perhaps causing some confusion. I\m
  pretty sure this is the group.


Image Dreams (ID)
-----------------
  Dim Screams (1997, 05.07, 64k Intro).

     12/94, 12/94-01/95), Zero (sysop 'ELITE 7').

Imagine was formed at the Magnetic Fields Copy Party, 27.10 1990, according
to Cracker Journal #23.


Impact
------
SWE> Goozer.
BEL> Cruel.
CAN> Glacier (sysop 'ICE FLOW NORTH').
USA> Shaolin (sysop 'DOUBLE IMPACT', 04/95).

     music, earlier Rebels, 12/93-12/94), Zip (code, 12/94).

Impact DK existed for years, steadily producing excellent demos, but never
quite breaking through. ROM #9 reported that they had now officially left
the Amiga for the PC scene.

Danish coder Nigel left to form Amaze Design late 97 with Misery/Insane.

  Futuristic Mind (1993, 28.12, AGA File).

  (font), music: "Ugle-Amok-Party" and "64er-Ugle-End" by Unison (Tracker
  Packer 3.1 format). 13th in The Party 4 demo competition.
  review: Cool! If you're a fan of scene ascii art, this demo is certainly
  one you'd want to download. Some traditional effects have been re-done
  here, in an AmigaDOS window and with ascii chars... Or perhaps not.
  I can't help but shake the feel that the DOS part is just as fake as the
  one in Andromeda's "D.O.S" (04/92). You can't backdrop or resize the
  window in any way, hmm... Well, what can I say? Morph's a fine ascii
  artist, the coding is clever, and the music is rather cool...DOWNLOAD!

  review: Impact has squeezed a lot out of their 4k with this one! It opens
  with an IMPACT pattern that moves :), then goes on to some interference.
  Next is a nice routine, in which a line vector 'cube' mutates quite
  heavily as it crashes into the walls of the 4 walls it's confined to. Next
  up is postage stamp-size, SLOW fractal zoomer and then a fake ending leads
  up to the final effect - three different keftales animations on a single
  screen and the text 'IMPACT DK - VI HAR SPIST CHOCOLADEN' (hence the
  name!). I have no idea where this was entered in a competition :)

Impulse was born in october 1992 on the initiative of Mr.Pixel, on the ashes
of the Hungarian Fi-Re Crew. Among the first members were also EFT and
Rendall. Their first two productions were both released in december, "First
Intro" (at Bash 3) and "Welcome Intro".
  1993 - In 1993, new members joined in Norway, Sweden, UK, Italy, Spain
and Austria. A few intros were released, but all other divisions soon
became inactive, and by the end of 1994, they were all gone. Their first
non-intro production was released at the Southern Party 93, the combined
slideshow and musicdisk "Art & Go" [07/93].
  1994 - A year of silence followed, before Mr.Pixel, the only remaining
original member, put together the Hungarian-only configuration that would be
the crew until their death in 1997. The only thing to get released in 94 was
the "Alive" [03/94] file demo at Cache. EFT released the game "Reunion"
through Grand Slam.
  1995 - They released the "Scenest Invitation" (a party for which they were
coarrangers) in march, and that was all that got released this year. The
party itself was held in may. They worked hard on releasing their demo
"Voyage In Storm" for The Party 95, but it proved impossible. EFT released
the game "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" for GameTek.
  1996 - After the disappointment of not being able to release "Voyage In
Storm" [01/96] at The Party, they simply released it anyway in january, out
of party. The demo was a huge success, but not as big as their second demo
of the year, "Muscles" [08/96]! An enclosed news file for the demo announced
that Gato (swap) had joined, that Beast (gfx) had joined from Majic 12 and
that Psycho (sysop) and S.L.O (raytrace) were kicked.
  1997 - The group died in july after releasing their final two intros,
"Kenguru v1.0" [03/97, Symposium 97] and "Kenguru v2.0" [04/97, Scenest 97].
The reasons were many, but among them were Rendall's leaving for Mystic, and
Mr.Pixel, Gato, S.L.O and Norby's inactivity on the amiga. EFT (code), Beast
(gfx, new 08/96), Soldier (03/97) and Lord (sysop 'NUMBER OF THE BEAST',
08/96) formed a new group called Kangooroo.

Hungarian graphician Rendall left to join Mystic in 97. Rendall is not only
  one of the best Hungarian painters (along with Beast), but also one of the
  original members of Impulse, having been a member since 1992. Impulse was
  his first scene group.
Hungarian raytracer Norby (08/96) left the scene late 96.
Italian swapper Device (93-94) joined Surprise! Productions.

  review: Surprise of the year! I came in expecting nothing, and was blown
  away! The demo opens with an introduction picture by Thomas. The picture
  is excellent, and features a bridge ascending into the skies. Then the
  music starts, and we get a texturemapped Impulse logo followed by three
  drawn logos, VOYAGE - IN - STORM. Next up is a vector cube with a ripple
  effect texture-mapped to each of the sides, which soon changes to
  rotating pictures. Next up is a cool Impulse logo, with a phonged torus
  in front. Then there's credits, timed to the music, before we're taken on
  a ride through an amazingly fast tunnel texturemapped. About halfway
  through, the music changes from techno to a more mellow kind of tune, and
  a dot-cube is added to the middle of the screen. We're then treated to
  another phonged object before a raytraced picture. What comes next only
  last for about 3 seconds, but is one of the most amazing pieces in the
  demo! It's a brief travel thru space, with planets and stuff... GREAT!
  Then, we're on to one of the best voxel routines I have ever seen! It's
  1x1, smooth, with a great, blue sky. After a while, they add some
  raytraced chinese characters scrolling up on the left hand side of the
  screen (beating Andromeda's 'raytraced scroller' in "Nexus 7" (12/94)
  easily!), and FEMALE VOCALS TO THE MUSIC! The experience is really
  awesome, and I had to turn off my stereo and watch the demo a second time
  to be sure I had heard correctly. Then we're shown a GREAT dragon-and-
  sorcerer picture by Rendall, and another raytraced pic, with wine glasses
  and the cool Impulse logo from before. Then, finally, we reached the
  endpart... It's got a ripple effect very similar to the one on the cube
  in the beginning - only fullscreen - and an up-scroller for messages and
  creds. What is best about the endpart, though, is the music. It's a sort
  of folk-tune with a flute, and a great piece of melody. Throughout the
  demo, Mr.Pixel's music is always functional - and in places excellent.
  You'd be mad not to download this - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Now go away - I'm
  gonna turn down the lights and watch it JUST ONE MORE TIME...
    Please be advised that the review refers to the version with the fixed
  mainfile found in STORMFIX.LHA on AmiNet.

  review: "Muscles". Oh yes, if there's anything this demo has lots of, then
  it's just "Muscles"! Brimming from end to end with smooth, powerful
  effects, fabulous graphics and a catchy techno soundtrack, this one's just
  SO close to perfect... The effects are imaginative, goodlooking and not
  least FAST! Design is another strong point, with design elements that
  never get in the way of the action, and near perfect blending between
  coding and bitmap graphics. The env and phong routines here also deserve a
  special mention, with LARGE objects that look absolutely gorgeous. Do I
  really need to go on? In an unusually strong year for demos, "Muscles" is
  certainly among the top 3 of the year. Beast's fullscreen picture is
  "Fish" (3rd at Assembly that that year), while Rendall's is "Useless To
  Run Bitch" (9th at Assembly that year). The demo was released
  simultaneously to the IO party and the AntIQ party in Hungary.
    The demo works on any 020+ machine, but 030-50 or faster is recommended.

-------------------
GER> Beathoven (music, 11/92-late96), Buckly (founder gfx, ex Deffpaccers
     [no entry], new 09/92-late96), Coach (code, late96), DJ Mellow Noise
     (music), Dulux (trade gfx), Eksec (Andreas Kuessner, mainorg code
     music sysop 'VISION THING' EHQ, ex Comedy, 05/93-05/94), Ernie (code,
     09/93), Gamekiller (partyhero^clown, ex Cruelty, 09/93), Marley (Mark
     Leitiger, founder code, 11/92-02/94), Reval (sysop 'LUNATIC ASYLUM', ex

     doublememb Duplo, 01/95), Hobbes (Mats Lundqvist, music, Honorary
     member, 11/92-12/93), Macroman (sysop 'TRADERS PARADISE', doublememb

Infect was founded in April 1992 by Spiv and Marley. Turbo and Marley are
the authors of famous music ripping tool Exotic Ripper. In addition, Turbo
also made the cruncher TurboSpike. Eksec, Smack and Zorro were once in
Comedy (92), but I do not know if they all joined directly.
  1994 - German members Black Raven (code, 04/94) and SMT (music, 05/93-)
  both left to join Haujobb 08/94, citing a lack of activity from the other
  Infect members as a main motivation. Two months later also German sysop
  Jailer ('THE PRISON' WHQ, 09/93-) joined Haujobb. In an interview in
  Sardonyx' "SeenPoint #2" [12/95] SMT claims Infect was his first group,
  which is curious since I have some information that indicates he joined
  the group from Alpha Flight in may of 1993?

Ted, sysop 'DARKNET' got kicked.
The Swedish division left to form a new group, called Medicine, probably in
  the early part of 1994. This concerns at least Morrow (music, 12/93),
  Lussar'n (code, 12/93), Jammie (gfx swap, ex Diffusion, 09-12/93) and
  Slime (ex Diffusion, 09/93). New Swedish members eventually joined,
  creating a new Swedish division.
Dutch musician and sysop Bart Simpson ('THE LEECH', 09/93) got kicked.
Swedish coder Exidor (ex Diffusion, 09-12/93) joined Razor 1911.
Saron (Marcus, ger swap, ex The Special Brothers, new late92), Blue (sysop),
  Gadget (ger swap), D-Icelord (hol, 09/93) and Snowball got kicked.
German musician and editor RokDaZone (ex Destiny, 10/93-95) left the group
  and the scene early 95. However, he couldn't stay away, and some time
  later reentered the scene as a member of Artwork.
Swedish graphician Ola Thorn (ex Case/Seance, new mid93-09/93) left.
The following are no longer members: Axeblade (hol trade sysop, 09/93-
  04/94), Burstmode (hol code, 04/94), Nike! (hol trader, 09/93-04/94).

IP was another relatively shortlived cracking/modem group, with some of
that scene's best people recruited from groups like Crystal and Skid Row.
The news of their birth came in RAW2 (published early 92), and the news of
their death in RAW3 (published april 92). Most of the member information is
from a memberlist published in RAW2. After their death, several members
(like Norwegian swapper Jaffa) left to form the new Bitstoppers.

Technoir was kicked.

· Virtual Conspiracy Intro (1995, 01.04, 40k Intro).
  Code: Metal, Gfx: Louie, Metal, Music: Senile.
  Released for the Virtual Conspiracy 95 40k intro, but unplaced.
  Review: Not terribly interesting, the best thing here comes at the very
  beginning with the burning vectors. Don't know what else to tell you...
  It's quite average.

  Frenzy (1995, 08.10, AGA 40k Intro).
  Code: Blaze, Gfx: Louie, Music: Jozef.
  Winner of the Remedy 95 40k intro competition!

· Frenzy 100% (1995, 22.10, AGA 40k Intro).
  Code: Blaze, Gfx: Louie, Music: Jozef.
  Review: Nicely designed but oh so short is this little winner intro.
  I guess they made a decision on the 'squaky tune and blocky picture' vs
  'short but extremely sweet' dilemma and chose the latter. Not that I'm
  complaining, I'm all for sweetness!
    The code's nothing revolutionary, and neither are the graphics or the
  music. The design is what I guess makes this one any special...
  This is the 100% version, which is 5k larger than the original 40k
  competition intro.
· GLE tested A1200/030-50/2mb chip, 4mb fast/3.0.

· Inside (1995, 28.12, AGA 40k Intro).
  Code: Blaze, Gfx: Louie, Music: Vedder.
  33rd in The Party 5 40k intro competition.
  Review: Objects, objects, objects... No, seriously, "Inside" opens with
  some credits (as - yes, you've guesse it - shaded objects) fly towards
  the viewer from various parts of the screen. The background has some sort
  of colorcycling effect, but it doesn't look too good. Everything here
  seems to use some kind of smoothing, which looks perhaps a little like
  what Virtual Dreams used in "242", only smoother. Short is ok if it's
  also sweet, but this isn't, really. It's more of an aftertaste thing :)
    This is not terribly interesting, but didn't really deserve to end up
  dead last either...

Insanity [australia]
--------------------
AUS> Aitken, Birdzone (ex Byterapers Inc.), Boner, Bullet, Cool Lat, Jaffa,
     Jorren, Leviathan, Mogwai (ex Byterapers Inc.), Syphan, The Control
     (ex Byterapers Inc.).

There was another Insanity group, from Denmark, but the two had nothing to
do with each other.


Insanity [denmark] (1991-)
--------------------------
DEN> Hille (Thomas Hillebrandt, music swap, ex Z.A.P/Byte Busters, 12/93-
     07/96), NME (Tue B. Petersen, mainorg gfx swap, old handle N.N.), RAW
     (Finn Nielsen, code swap), RFC (Rune Friis Clausen, gfx swap).

Insanity was formed by N.N (later NME), RAW and RFC in 1991 or 1992 (noone
really remembers, Hille told me =D), and was a purely danish group. They
were part of the demoscene, but never really released anything except small
tools. There was another Insanity group, from Australia, but the two had
nothing to do with each other. The group is now in hibernate mode, with no
members still active on the scene, but with an option to perhaps return one
day... Thanks to Hille for information!
  1993 - At the end of december, Hille finished on a disappointing 23rd
position in The Party music competition with his song "Rubber Computer".
  1996 - At the South Sealand party in july, Hille finished 17th in the
music competition with his module "Fede Fisk I Flasken".


In-Sect
-------
???> Bionic (code, 12/95), Ledge (code, 12/95), Maxty (music, 12/95), W rax
     (raytrace, 12/95).

· The Party 5 Intro (1995, 28.12, AGA 40k Intro).
  Code: Bionic, Gfx: Ledge (objects), Pixie/Polka Brothers (pic), Music:
  Maytz. 25th in The Party 5 40k intro competition.
  Review: After the intro sequence, with a static guraud shaded face
  object, we quickly move on to a voxelspace routine. This is one of the
  most simple ones I've seen, and not remarkable in any way. The rest of
  the intro features a lot of gouraud shading, and not much else. Don't
  these people realise that "G-Force" was the final word in gouraud?
  Granted, I do not think I've seen a gouraud glenz - before or after -
  but the fact remains that it's not all that interesting anymore...
  Pixie's contribution comes in the form of a small picture of a screaming
  face trying to break free of something, sort of pressing its face off
  a platform. It's one of Pixie's better pictures. The highlight comes at
  the end though, with a little humorous (not to mention gouraud shaded)
  Intel Outside logo spinning...
    One major drawback about this intro is the unimaginative use of
  color; everything's in shades of blue or shades of brown. Perhaps these
  guys should consider recruiting a graphician to do their design?
  The spelling of this group's name is not consistent through the intro;
  they use both In-Sect and Insect.

Instinct was born as a Norwegian demo group, probably around the beginning
of 1997. Their leader is Punisher. In addition to their diskmag "Retro" they
also produced the Norwegian charts, "NorskToppen".
  1997 - Artwork's "Generation #24" [04/97] reported that Hellrazor joined
from EMS Design, that norwegian Chauple (code) doublejoined from Contraz,
that norwegian Fenriz (code) doublejoined from Rape,

In october, Psalt (code) and Romeo left. Danish swapper Receiver joined from
Limited Edition.

· Retro #1 (1997, 15.11, AGA Multifile Diskmag).
  code: Mr.X, Ben Wyatt (additional), gfx: Psycho, music: "Retro.Main",
  "Retro.Sub" and "Project_R" by Tentacle.
  review: First impressions are less than great, with some dodgy graphics by
  Psycho introducing us to the mag. The mag itself doesn't have a stunning
  interface either, but they also admit this in their editorial, and promise
  to improve for the next issue. Three pieces of music by the same author is
  perhaps a little much, some variation could be in order. They do seem to
  have used the classic "MicroKnight" font, but we will forgive them for
  now. The code does seem to be functional though, and the mag works fine.
  No cliparts, scrolling or other fancy effects, but again they promise more
  for the next issue. Not much to read this time either, but again... This
  is a mag I expect I will wait for the next issue before I really judge.
    Noone is really credited as editor, but Psycho seems to be the one doing
  the most for the mag. Almost certainly released outside a party.

Interactive is a german group, born by members of Equinox, Coma and others
in early 1992. Rumours of their death in White Noise #1 [early 94] seem to
exaggerated. I have three different boards all listed as being the WHQ at
one time or another.
  1992 - German swapper Ghost joined Submission in august.
  1993 - At The Party in december, the group released at least two versions
of Dodger's new pack Bouncing Bytes; #2 and #3. Inside, Abyss (who joined
mid 93) is quoted as 'whq', perhaps suggesting he took over leadership of
the group after he joined?

Moomchild and The Trixter joined Surprise! Productions.
Norwegian swapper and trader Razorblade got kicked, so he joined up with
  Majic 12 mid 93.
Finnish swapper Velsa (ex Addicts) joined Calibra.
Bad Karma joined Deadline.
All Giants members joined in Germany!

  Dance Trance (ECS Musicdisk).

  Dance Trance 2 (1993, ECS Musicdisk, 2 disks).

· Bouncing Bytes pacmenu (1993, late, ECS packmenu).
  code: Leander, Lunatic (additional), gfx: Dodger, music: Abyss, editor:
  Dodger.
  review: Well, this menu offers no eyecandy of any kind, just the basics.
  Upon loading, it presents you with a badly drawn Interactive logo, the
  choice of some productions in the middle of the screen and a scroller at
  the bottom. The whole thing unfortunately both looks and feels amateurish.
  you can press the right mousebutton for a 'magpart', done in the same
  design and not much better. The text is just the usual, 'news' and
  adverts. I cannot bring myself to recommend this to anyone. At least it
  works just fine on accelerated machines.
    The issue reviewed was #3 [12/93]. The menu was used for at least issues
  #1-#3, and from this we think it was first released late 93, november or
  possibly december.

  Review: This sucks. No design, no impressive effects, and the music is a
  serious contender for 'worst chiptune of 1995'. It all opens with some
  flame-text, which is the best effect in the intro. Then we're taken on to
  a stretching zoomrotator (oooold!), a transforming dot-object (older!),
  and some other equally uninteresting stuff. Avoid.

Interpol was an elite illegal crew. I don't know if the guys that released
the intro "Tahiti" (04/96) are the same as the original Interpol. Seems a
little strange, after all this time, to come back to release an intro...
  Since german sysops Joker and TCM were in Razor early in the year, and
Razor then died, it seems probable they went straight to this group.
Most members left to reform Paradox! The group died early 1993.

German Siriax joined Fairlight.
The board 'PURGATORY' is closed.
German swapper Killraven rejoined Paradise.
British Kawinski has left the scene to pursue a career as a teacher (ROM4).

  Contribution to the Intel Outside 95 64k intro competition.
  Review: This intro opens very nicely, with a good flame routine that
  spurts out INTRUDERS and PRESENTS in flames before the intro starts
  proper. I really wish they'd just kept the one effect, and not bothered
  us with all the shit that makes up the rest of this intro! Those vector
  cubes - shaded or not - have to be among the most blocky, buggy and ugly
  ones I've ever seen. There's a third routine, though, which is dots that
  make up tunnels and stuff. Not very interesting, I'm afraid.

Boards; BLACK PLANET.

Iris was based in France (and later mostly in Denmark), and was born in
1989. They were also the arrangers of the danish Scene Meeting parties.
They recruited the entire Danish division of D-29, which means at least
Darkhawk, other names are uncertain. Mandrake is the coder of "Explora 3"
(Infomedia) with music by Ulrick. Today their undisputed leader is Darkhawk
from Denmark.
  1992 - Digital Master left early 92.
  1993 - News in Eurochart #22 [11/93] that Bridgeclaw left to join Shamrock
were probably untrue.
  1994 - The entire Danish division of D-29 joined Iris in january. This was
at least Darkhawk, other names are uncertain. Dazl joined Investation early
in the year.
  1996 - Swappers Sir Maxin (Svein H. Orjansen, swap, late95) and Peace
(ger, 95) were kicked due to the bad contact with the other members in june.
Also in june, Radix was kicked because of inactivity and Speed left to be
independent.
  1997 - Baltic swapper Miko 63 (Michael Arvantis) was kicked because of a
lack of contact. "World of Chips #4" [02/97], "World of Chips #5" [03/97],
"Deep Bass Nine BBSTro" [03/97] was released. April saw the release of
"Avatar #5" [04/97]. Danish sysop Azlan closed his board and left the scene.
Danish swapper Adonis was kicked due to inactivity, but later returned to
the group. Sticky joined with his board 'ORGANIZED CONFUSION', but was
kicked again after a short while. Pudding was kicked due
to inactivity. German musician  Dascon regained scene inspiration, and after
a short stay in Iris, he rejoined his old group Essence late in the year.
"Delaytro" [10/97] was released to tell the world of the delay to their
proposed party Scene Meeting 97, which is now to be held in february of 98.
The intro also announced Ransom as a new member.
  2000 - Early in the year Cupid (code) joined from Darkage, Yon (gfx)
joined while danish coder Hastur (96-) decided to leave the scene. Ransom's
debut demo as a coder (he joined as a raytracer) "Abecedarian" [11/00] was
released at TRSAC 00.5, where it finished 2nd in the competition.
  2001 - Just before the group travelled to the Mekka Symposium party in
germany in august, three central members sadly decided to leave the group
and the scene. Danes Bandy (gfx, 96-), Judas and finally veteran Tricktrax
(code music) all left. The group released the demo "Light" [04/01] at MS,
announcing the departure of the three, and also announced they were
recruiting graphicians. Shortly after, graphician SuperK joined from
Darkage.

Norwegian swapper mJ left to join Massive.
German graphicians Gfx-Twins joined Platin.
Norwegian musician P.O.W (07/95) was later in Sunshine Productions.
Swedish Shock left to join Vision.
English swapper Overdose joined Delicious.
Jef and Yoga left to join Outlaws.
Vigo and Ghost joined Agnostic Front.

  review: Bifrost's picture that opens this is mediocre, then we are shown a
  blue phong-shaded shape over a nicely animated menu, then a cube with the
  background texturemapped onto it...looks almost like its transparent. Over
  this some text then appears, explaining how the group was forced to move
  their party Scene Meeting from october 97 to february of 98. Pressing the
  lmb makes a caleidoscopic water ripple effect appears, only the pattern
  does not look a lit like water. Then the cube reappears, and also some
  more text overlaid onto it. Left mouse bitton, and we get an object with
  the words TAK INTENS! over an animated background, and then some more
  text...and it's over. The intro announces Ransom as a new member.

  review: Oh boy, this isn't good. What Iris has done here is take an old
  intro (1996 - check the version string!) and revive it with some new (I
  presume!) graphics. Nothing is above average here, and thankfully this is
  not an important production for them. If it were, they would be left
  shameful. Improve Iris!

  with me =( If someone with superior hardware wants to do one, get in
  touch, but unfortunately Iris I quite simply can't supply a review of this
  demo. Eternally sorry.
    The demo is dedicated to Bandy, Judas and Tricktrax - all of whom sadly
  decided to leave the scene shortly before the MS party where this demo was
  released. This means that this demo probably represents Tricktrax' final
  work on the amiga demoscene.

  Review: An average intro/demo from these French guys. There's not much to
  recommend it code-wise, really, since there's only two effects in the
  entire demo. They're used several times, but it's still only two effects!
  One is a zoom-rotator that's used for a mario-kart like road trip as
  well, and the other is a zoomrotating plasmazoom. Well, who ever said
  that demo effects were easy to describe :) We won't mention the music.
  Keep trying, though!
    My previous information says it requires AGA...is this true? I don't
  think there's any 256 color stuff in the demo...? The executable file
  (unpacked) is 1.1mb, so it's gonna take a little memory, but... It loops
  back and starts over again at the end.
