The Finnish division released an intro that the world HQ felt didn't live
  up to their standards, so as a result the Finnish section got kicked out.
  These were: Bit (PC Code), Dectech (PC Trade), Maniac, PetShopBoy (Mikko
  Virtanen, ex Diffusion, later The Hooligan/Fanatic), Safe, Seven (PC
  Code), Slayer and Slipper (code, ex Diffusion).

  code: Joram, gfx: Nirvana, $platter, Overload, Frode, music: Anders

  info: This slideshow - of a girl Morgoth was in love with - got him in a
  whole heap of trouble... It all ended with her finding out about the
  slideshow, and suing Morgoth, on the grounds of a hidden part where you
  could view a manipulated picture of the girl, with her head and someone
  else's naked body...

· Restricted (1994, 13.03, ECS Intro).
  code: Slipper, gfx: Overlord, music: Petshopboy.
  review: This intro is the finnish section's first production, and it's
  actually quite ok. It's a very standard design, with logo on top, vector
  cube moving in the middle and scroller at the bottom. But the logo is
  actually pretty good, and the design is quite adequate, so... This is by
  no means a great production - there are a million of these - but it's
  certainly not the worst of its kind. The music is chippy. Even with
  KillAGA, there are some graphical errors.

  Released for the Compusphere 7 demo competition.
  review: The biggest problem about this demo, I guess, is quality control.
  Someone should have sat down with these presumably 14-year-olds and told
  them to go home and practice some more before submitting this to the
  public. The graphics are embarassing, the coding has goddamned after
  burned line vectors as the main attraction, and the music...sort of
  follows the style of the rest of the demo.
    The demo is mostly built on supposed humour segments, where by far the
  best is the tiled face that slides into place, only to have it's eyes
  flying around in its head, looking at small female breasts. The duck
  stuff is almost as embarassing as the graphics, though... This demo works
  on an unexpanded A1200...though this reviewer wishes it hadn't! Back to
  the drawing board, Candle.

Capsule are one of the oldest and most well respected Spanish teams.
Spanish coder Darklord (10/95) is probably deceased, since "Quicktro"
[06/97] is dedicated to his memory.
  1997 - Spanish coder Flynn left late 97.
  2000 - Spanish musician Estrayk (Carlos Del Alamo, doublememb Nah-Kolor,
06/97-) left the amiga scene for good early in the year, in favour of the
growing scene on the Playstation. Estrayk used to be one of the organizers
of the group.

· Career (1995, 14.10, AGA 64k Intro).
  code: Kustom, gfx: Magnum, Dixie (end anim), music: Evelred.
  Winner of the Euskal Party 3 64k intro competition!
  review: Nothing very outstanding about this intro; graphics and design
  are ok, music's listenable... The most advanced effect, I guess, is the
  burning ring. Nicest moment: Being kicked in the face towards the end.
  Not bad; not too memorable either.

  3rd in the Euskal Party 3 demo competition.
  review: Short is certainly an appropriate name! It's short and not
  particularly sweet. The best effect has to be the zoom-rotator, which
  looks good, but unusual. Cheating, people? Music is the usual frantic
  techno. It's been done to death, and much better than this. If you're
  tired of traditional music, try out Impulse's "Voyage In Storm"!
  And by the way, that ripple effect on the endscroller is bugged!!
  030-50 recommended.

· Assault! (1996, AGA File).
  code: Kustom, gfx: ZooN/Silicon (animbackground), music: Evelred (The
  Player 6.1A format).
  review: Assault is a very SMOOTH demo, with most routines flowing by like
  water through my fingers... It opens with a fast but undetailed flight
  over a voxelspace landscape. It continues with some all-too-familiar
  afterburned objects...see if any of these ring a bell: duck, torus, face?
  The best routine in the demo, perhaps, is a colorful tunnel that we
  blast through at a moderate pace at first, only to speed up considerably
  as the music changes its mood. Nicely done. Assault does have a certain
  sense of style, perhaps most evident during the stretching meteorstorm
  credits part and the intro with the text that appears in time to the
  soundtrack. To conclude, I guess I like this a little. If they could
  get a decent graphician in, and consider trying out some new objects they
  could very well make a killer demo sometime soon :) The music's not
  anything special, though. I do know that Evelred has won several music
  competitions, so there's bound to be a few good tunes in him!
    Please note that the version tested was an '040 fixed' version released
  to AmiNet 02/97. The demo makes use of Ludde/Encore's c2p routine.

  code: Peskanov, gfx: Estrayk (textures), Oops! (textures, objects),
  Peskanov (objects), music: Evelred (The Player 6.1A format).
  review: Capsule surprise us here with some pretty fucking amazing 3D!
  Prior to seeing this, I'd never heard of Peskanov - rest assured that
  from now on I'm VERY aware of this guy! Quicktro consists of scenes and
  objects, much like many other recent demos, but the superior amount of
  color and detail set this three notches above anything that came before
  it. The main routines here are in HAM6 1x1, with the final toruses in
  HAM8 1x1. Needless to say, it looks pretty f... amazing. It's hard to
  speak about this demo without using some 'colorful' language; it's the
  only way to do it justice! Just wait till you see that galleon...
  If this is Peskanov's idea of a quick production, then I'm gonna be doing
  what the figure in the first scene is doing once he releases a full demo!
    Quicktro obviously needs a faster machine than mine to really shine,
  but the 3D already knocks the socks off almost everything else even on my
  machine. The music by Evelred is perfect for this production; powerful
  but minimalist. There ought to be a law against making demos that are
  THIS good - it makes all the other ones look like fools!
  Dedicated to the memory of Darklord.

· Trailway (1997, 26.07, AGA HD Demo).
  code: Kustom, gfx: Zaac (pictures), Judas (pictures, textures), music:
  Pink (The Player 6.1A format).
  2nd in the Euskal Party 97 demo competition.
  review: Oooh yes! They claim this is an 'unfinished demo' in their
  accompanying text file, and it does end rather abruptly... But what is
  here is actually enough to qualify this as one of the best demos of the
  year! The best thing about "Trailway" is its speed - everything runs fast
  and smooth, no matter what effects are onscreen! The whole show opens with
  a nice Capsule logo, then some credits appear. These zoom from 'behind'
  the screen and into it, and it looks very very cool =) Next is a
  fullscreen Trailway title picture by Judas. Then a circuitboard texture is
  mapped on a ball which bounces around...it's hard to describe, but
  download and be enlightened! :) Then some text appears, 'backlit' with
  flying blue particles, saying 'are you prepared for demo ART?' Next is
  what appears to be two snow crystal objects, then the most awesome effect
  in the demo: An animated envmapped face tries to break out through a box,
  twisting this way and that in an effect that looks just stunning - a true
  showstopper! Next is a fast texturemapped cityscape, followed by a cyber-
  woman fullscreen picture by Judas...then the cityscape routine reappears,
  only this time with a MUCH large scene - seemingly without losing ANY
  speed! It's just so amazingly smooth... Then we see Zaac's first
  contribution, a fullscreen picture of a screaming naked woman with the
  british flag in the background...and then nothing, the demo just ends.
    No information available on memory requirement, but we'll hazard a guess
  at somewhere in the region of 4MB.

Carillon
--------
Carillon was formed by Dweezil and Heatbeat after Heatbeat was kicked from
the finnish section of Rebels. After releasing two demos in 1992, they
merged with Cyberiad to create one of the best ever Finnish teams; Carillon
and Cyberiad Institutes (CNCD). At least Heatbeat (music), Destop (gfx), WDO
(code) and Major Tom (music, ex Anarchy) came along to the new group.
  Despite rumours, Golem (ex Anarchy) never joined DCS, and this was likely
the last group the Finnish graphician was a member of.

Finnish musician and graphician Dean (12/92) joined Damones.
Finnish members Wraith and Major Tom (music) left the scene 09/92.
  Didn't Major Tom move on to CNCD?
Finnish coder and cofounder Dweezil is no longer a member. He can be found
  in Stellar sometime later.

Centolos is a Spanish demo group, formed for fun in 1994 by various members
of other groups that had just died. In 1997 the group merged with Dosis to
create the group Centosis - and simultaneously moved the entire group to the
pc platform. They are well respected in the pc scene today, mainly due to
their role in organizing most parties held in Spain. Thanks to former member
Wavemaker (now in Trinity and Glue) for information!
  1996 - Humphrey (gfx), Ravana (swap) and Sapphire (code) joined from
Necropolis. Bladerunner (swap) joined early in the year.
  1997 - Artwork's "Generation #24" [04/97] reported that Specktro (gfx) was

  review: In my book this will always be the 'puzzle intro'. You see, the
  design is based on pieces of jigsaw puzzles, hence... OK, anyroad.
  There's a few effects and a few textscreens. The best is some kind of
  colorcycle-plasma thing and a non-textured Doom thingie. As you've
  probably sensed, I'm bored now so I'm off to do something FUN instead!
    If you want the graphics from this, just extract the IFF's from the
  depacked file with WRip or a similar tool.

  code: Fallos, gfx: Fallos (logo), Dexter (font), music: "Another One" by
  B.I.T (4ch MOD format). Released at the Arendal party.
  review: A slightly innovative but ultimately deadly unexciting intro.
  The innovative part is the logo, which has individual waving characters,
  overlapping each other as the logo waves...but that's about it. Deadly
  boring for the most part, with lousy graphics and thoroughly boring
  music. The sinescroll bugs even with KillAGA.

  code: Floppy, gfx: Dexter (logo), Floppy (font), music: "Neological" by
  B.I.T (4ch MOD format). Released at the Arendal party.
  review: This message box is a rather plasma-heavy production, with an
  overload of plasma-like color making its overall appearance one of 'too
  much'! The design is rather basic, with an unexciting Cinefex logo at the
  top of the screen, a scroller at the bottom, and - you've guessed it - a
  textplotter in the middle. It is, incidentally, this plotter that has all
  those plasma colors under it.

Circle (1993-1993)
------------------
Circle was a swedish demo group formed in may 1993 by Schizo (ex Noxious),
Colorbird, Some1 and Prime (all ex Scoopex). The lifespan of Circle was
short, however, as both Colorbird and Schizo later in the year moved on -
first to join Alcatraz, then to form Illusion. Most members of Circle later
wound up in Illusion, and then eventually Razor 1911. Circle members that
moved on to Illusion were at least Lionheart (ex Insane), Some1 and Prime
(both ex Scoopex). As a consequence, Circle died.
  Information in Balance's "Upstream #7" [11/93] that Some1 and Prime joined
from Artech seem to be false.

Finnish Sphinx (ex Styline) got kicked.
Swedish graphician PGL joined Nova, but soon wound up in Illusion with most
  of his old groupmates.

· Sometimes I Wish I Was Famous (1993, 31.05, ECS File).
  code: Colorbird, gfx: Butch/TSL, Tony/Alcatraz (logo), music: Some1 &
  Prime. 7th in The Computer Crossroads 93 demo competition.
  review: The first (and only?) Circle demo is a rather forgettable
  affair, unfortunately. There's mostly vector and dot-stuff on offer here.
  The tune initially sounds promising, with some nice use of speech samples
  and stuff, but the novelty soon wears off. Too forgettable is my
  judgement.

Circle of Power (-1990)
-----------------------
Circus of Power died late 1990, when all members decided to close the group
and instead join Abakus - thus creating theat group's Norwegian division.

  code: Asa, gfx: Mindeye, Viggin (raytrace), music: Carebear/Orange (The
  Player 6.1A format). 8th in The Assembly 96 demo competition.
  review: A little bland, this. There's the usual envmapping, but nothing
  to excite me or make me say 'that's original'. In a few short words, it's
  same shit, new (and not necessarily better) wrapping. The only effect I
  really liked in this demo is the one with the angray face wrapped onto
  the sphere. The face twists and waves in various ways. That was ok.
    There are three raytraced logos and a fullscreen picture. The picture,
  "Adam Finds Eva" by Mindeye also competed in the graphics competition,
  where it was unplaced. It says nowhere whether it needs fastmem or not.
  The system during the endscreen upscroller is weird...Left mousebutton
  has no effect, while right exits. Weird...
· GLE tested A1200/030-50/2mb chip, 4mb fast/3.0.

· Hope 2 (1996, 28.09, AGA 64k Intro).
  code: ASA, gfx: none, music: Turbo'boo (The Player 6.1A format).
  review: Taking into consideration the tag line '3 hour production', I was
  positively surprised by "Hope 2". It's a small, limited production, but
  with some excellent core code work that shines through, and reveals some
  good potential beneath the surface. This is a typical 'object' intro, but
  given that, it's a nice colorful and pretty fat variation. My only real
  complaint is the rather ungraceful exit it performed on my machine, with
  the last note of the music beeeeeeping my ears to madness. For three
  hours worth of work, this is very nice.
    The C2P routine used was published to AmiNet (dev/asm/asac2p2.lha)
  10/96, with the intro included in the archive.

  4th in the Demolition 96 II demo competition.
  info: Seeing as I don't have a maths processor (FPU), I have not yet been
  able to see this demo. Is Carebear a real member, or did Orange [pc] just
  loan him out? He participated in the music competition at the same party
  under the handle Carebear/Orange and Jamm, so this seems most likely.

Citron [hol] (1993-)
--------------------
Citron was formed in late 1993 by dutch sysop THC/Justice ('MYSTIC PLACE'),
but the group didn't exist long before THC moved on to legend, presumably
killing the group in the process. This group has nothing to do with the
Swedish group Citron. (Citron-point).

     (founder, gfx, doublememb Sardonyx, old handle Electron, 12/93-12/96).

Citron. (note the point at the end) is a Swedish demo group, formed by
S.Duvan and Electron in early 1993. In 1994, Slash joined as a double member
from IFFTiC. In addition to their own diskmag Oepir Risti (which they are
most known for), much of the team also helped C-Lous with their "No Sense"
mag.

  Oepir Risti issue #1 (1994, Diskmag).
  code: S.Duvan, gfx: Electron, music: Jogeir/independent.
  info: Intro is a nicely drawn logo by Chevron/The Silents. Music is by
  Jogeir, and is a conversion of an old c64 tune (original possibly by
  Laxity). It was reviewed very favourably in Propaganda #3.

  Oepir Risti issue #2 (1994, Diskmag).
  code: S.Duvan, gfx: Tobias Jansson, music: "Orthanc" by Lizardking.
  info: The tune 'Orthanc' by Lizardking was later used in the
  Razor 1911 musicdisk "Memorial Songs II" (1995).

  Oepir Risti issue #3 (Diskmag).
  code: S.Duvan, gfx: Tobias Jansson (main), Prowler/Passion (titlepicture),

Classic was one of the better cracking crews based in Sweden, just like
Fairlight and Defjam. The leader was Stalker, and their main cracker was
Ringo Starr (both later in the reborn Quartex). They died in late 1991
(most probable) or early 92.

C-Lous has grown from a relatively small group to a group of international
proportions! Their coders are their best asset, and solid names like Origo,
Prospect and Scout are not to be taken lightly... Origo was a member of
Medicine for a few months before rejoining. Crazy D and Zent have the same
real name....
  1993 - The group was born, and their first demo was released at the MCS
party [07/93].

Swedish musician duo Some1 and Morrow (08/96) left to join Rebels 08/97,
  after making music for one of their recent demos.
Swedish graphician and swapper Pozz (Patrik Johansson, 12/95-09/96) decided
  to leave the scene.
Swedes Mega (music), Mr.Mygg (music, 12/95), Stardust (gfx, 11/95) and TmX
  (gfx, 04/96) all left to form a new group called Dole.
Scout took a little break from coding after being busy for some time

· Suck Dick (AGA Intro).
  code: Origo, gfx: Frame, Pozz, music: "Ccccp" by Mr.Mygg (Tracker Packer
  3 format).
  review: An average intro from Origo, with most of his common effects.
  That means a zoomrotator (this time with a smiling purple face :) is
  always present... This intro looks like any of his other 40/64k'ers,
  only with less chippy music :) Too bad Origo couldn't use the extra
  space to create something worthwhile. Seriously lacking in originality.
  And why the excessive profanity, Origo?
    Nowhere in the intro is a release date mentioned; can anybody help me
  determine when this was released?

  code: Origo, gfx: Claw, Pozz, music: Claw.
  Released for The Gathering 94 40k intro competition.
  review: This was supposed to compete in the Gathering intro competition,
  but was disqualified because the decruncher needed fastmem. Origo was
  reportedly VERY upset.

  12th in The Party 4 40k intro competition.
  review: Works fine on the A2000, but was obviously made on a faster
  machine - the effects take forever to finish. Also, the opening graphics
  are somewhat fucked (if colorcycling wasn't intended...and given the way
  it looks, I think not!) It works perfectly fine on the A1200. Press the
  right mousebutton to pause the zoomscroller and text.

· Time Square (1995, 01.04, 40k Intro).
  code: Prospect, gfx: Frame, music: Destructor/Obscene.
  2nd in the Virtual Conspiracy 95 40k intro competition.
  review: It's the design more than the code that sets "Time Square" apart
  from the competition, and secured its second place. Effects here include
  a chunky tunnel, yet another variation on the cityscape from Pygmy
  Projects "Extension" and some spacecut spheres. But, as mentioned, it's
  the design and execution that sets it apart. It has an air of
  professionality to it.

· Virtual Conspiracy (1995, 01.04, ECS 40k Intro).
  code: Origo, gfx: Pozz, music: Mr.Mygg. Released for the Virtual
  Conspiracy 95 40k intro competition, but was unplaced.
  review: Apparently, there's something wrong with the way graphics are
  displayed here, since several effects look strange on my system - even
  with KillAGA - and the first effect isn't properly displayed at all.
  Due to this it's hard to judge the intro as a whole, but it doesn't
  really look like I've missed something. Interestingly, this intro ALSO
  has a variation on the "Extension" cityscape! Ultimately quite limited.

  code: Origo, gfx: Pozz, music: Morrow & Some1/Razor 1911.
  Winner of the Icing 95 intro competition!
  review: Not bad at all, this little intro. It opens with a nice little
  C-Lous logo by Pozz, then continues onto a gouraud/texturemapped spacecut
  routine. Next there's some bitmap manipulation on a picture of a face...
  There's a couple of more routines too, but you get the picture.
  The tune's not too bad, though the chipfactor is a little high.
    Though the intro works fine on my machine, it obviously runs too fast
  for its own good... Some of the objects really sprint off!

  Released at The Party 95.
  review: Very cool, smooth opening to this polished little demo from
  C-Lous, highlighted by some excellent graphical work. The code is nothing
  really special, just the twister bars early in the demo were special.
  This was most probably released outside the competition.

  the saving grace here.

  code: Origo, Scout, gfx: Pozz, music: Some1 & Morrow.
  5th in the Assembly 96 64k intro competition.
  review: This is very good! From the moment the C-Lous logo smashes onto
  the screen to the first beats of the bassdrum, you know this is a
  competent production. The techno music kicks quite a bit, and does not
  suffer from the chip syndrome (squaeeeaaakk...) at all. Definitely cool!
  There are four effects here, all sharing the rather purple palette.
  We're treated to some shading, a tunnel, a voxelspace and some multiple
  toruses. It's all over rather quickly, but it's a sweet ride.
  Works on standard A1200, but a 030 and fastmem is recommended.

  (main), music: "Dosk Forever" by Some1 & Morrow featurning Lizardking,
  "Hazel" by Elusive and Radix (both 4ch MOD format), editor: Frame.
  review: This mag opens great, with a fabulous title picture by the Gfx-
  Twins to the first beat of the equally great music...then the picture
  fades down and there's a really cool little welcome-animal to greet you!
  So we start to explore the mag...and it feels just great! Smoooooth
  scrolling, a goodlooking panel, and an overall air of professionalism
  oozes out of its ever pore!
    Well, have spent over an hour reading already...and I can just say that
  the feeling continues! The code is perfect, the mag's pleasantly written,
  and there's oodles of interesting and thoughtful material! Just great!
  It would be a CRIME not to download this mag, ok? Oh, and it multitasks -
  naturally! If you want the tunes, just depack them (they're in the 'music'
  directory), and they're ready to go!

HOL> Mark (Mark Dankers. trade music, ex Banal Projects, new 08/93).
???> Hmd (code, 12/97), Sly (code, 12/97).

CNCD resulted as a merger of the two groups Carillon and Cyberiad.
Some of the above, like Juliet and Destop, are active cross-platform.
Probably their most famous member must be the now-inactive Heatbeat, one of
the greatest musicians to ever grace the Amiga platform.
  Finnish musicians Groo, Dean, Heatbeat and Dizzy have released a CD
called simply "CNCD" through scenerelated record company TRSI Recordz
(ROM4). News in RAW #6 that Dean and Fraction joined Damones are untrue,
they just joined as doublemembers.
  1997 - And just when we thought we'd heard the last from CNCD they strike
back with a "Killer" [12/97] of a demo at The Party!

Finnish graphician Kube (05-12/95) left to join Stellar (ROM4). How can
  this possibly be right, when ROM4 was released 05/95, and the "Closer"
  demo was released 12/95!?
The dutch Astro, who was a CNCD and Movement doublememb, left them both for
  Virtual Dreams.

  review: Not a very good one, I'm afraid... It's a short trackmo without
  too much to shout about. It's too AVERAGE for the most part, with neither
  the gfx, music or code ever really coming alive. The only sign of
  innovation was the broken glass vector cube, I haven't seen that before.

  review: Whoaaa... This signals a new age in the way demos are made.
  Instead of the old effect-effect-effect demos, this is more a journey
  through (chunky!) landscapes and colors. The biggest drawback, I feel, is
  the music. It's not really a TUNE as such, it's more just music made to
  suit the demo, without an identity of its own. Wasn't that flower picture
  by Kube used in RAW #8, albeit in lower resolution?
    At The Gathering 1996, CNCD released a PC demo called "Inside" from
  much the same team as this one. Given the name, I suppose it's a sequel
  of sorts... Anyway, if you (like me :D) have a Pentium gathering dust in
  your bedroom (any room will do, though ;), it's well worth a look!

Boards; MATERIAL WORLD (new mid 91).

Coma was a german demo group, first formed at the Action Conference 90 in
october, and became a fully operation group at the the Amiga Expo the
following month. It was a fusion of the three groups Antares, Exage and
Exess.
  1991 - Coma was very active in their first months of existence, releasing
several intros and demos at both the Action Conference in february and the
CeBit 91 in march. More intros and demos followed, until the group was
completely reformed around the middle of the year, and a lot of 'dead meat'
was forced to leave. This probably means Mr.L, Cato, Tomcat (music),
Slugger, Lawbreaker, Tracer, Booker, Chatman, Alva, Hellraiser, Rockstar (ex
Agile, new mid91), Ariel, Calypso, Sub Zero, Ze Worst and Hygraicc. This
event was announced in their intro "Kick Out". Finnish member Curse joined
Arise in september. The releases kept coming, with several new demos like
"Burger Hill" and "Hot Dots" and the first two issues of their successful
diskmag, "McDisk" the future looked great. Swiss swapper Antifast joined
Zenith late91.
  1992 - Unfortunately, the start of the year would prove disastrous for
Coma. After releasing the third issue of "McDisk" in january, their three
best german coders (Microforce, Cosmos and Zap joined Sanity; their best
musician (Virgill) joined TRSI and the rest of the group (Control, Mad
Butcher, Head (old handle Amok), Jackie D., Mission, Tom Copper, Mop (ex
Dartagnan/Axis old, new mid91), Nick O'Teen and Aahz decided to join
Alcatraz rather than keep it going as a separate group. Their diskmag came
with them to the new group. Cytax' "I.C.E #8" [mid92] reported that the
group Interactive was born by former members of Equinox, Coma and others, so
some former members probably also found their way there. Germans Renegade
(gfx, 01/92) and Orbit (08/91) joined Design, probably early 92.

German Tripex (02/91) joined Equinox.
Englishman Jongle joined Damage Inc.
German swapper Brutus joined Armageddon.

Complex is a legendary demo crew, based in Finland, where their leader Mic
Dair lives. For a great many years they worked on the Amiga, though they
now seem to have abandoned our platform completely in favour of the PC.
Their PC section still has most of the original members, like Jugi.
Mr.Spiv is the author of the packer program StoneCracker.
News of the forming of the German division were in R.A.W #2.
German musician Virgill joined Complex according to PRP4, but Virgill made
music for the TRSI demo "Twin Peaks" [12/96]... I believe the truth is
closer to a double membership.
  They have released an unknown number of issues of their diskmag "Maggy".
Artifex came 2nd at at ASM95 with "Mystery". When King Cobra rejoined
06/95, the news read '...is back with a new board'.
  1990 - Hyde left the group to join up with rising star Image around the
middle of the year, but left after a not too short time, and eventually
found his way back to Complex.
  1991 - The Finnish board 'COMPLEX SOFTBANK' (pc section) was busted late
91, and this was the first real Finnish bust.
  1992 - The group was strengthened when Finnish coder Epidemic joined from
Addonic around january. Celat joined Supplex 09/92. Finnish graphician
Morpheus left for Chrome in september.
  1993 - Coder Epidemic (ex Addonic, 06/92-93) joined Banal Projects some
time during 1993; He did NOT join VD, as claimed in Spaceballs' "R.A.W #6"
[12/93]. During his time in Complex he worked on some intros [92 and 93] as
well as the musicdisk "Book of Songs" [93].
  1994 - After releasing their last demo for Complex, "Real" [04/94],
musician Clawz and coder Gengis (both ex Digital, new ca 11-12/93) decided
to leave to form their own group called Bomb! in August 1994. They left
behind a few great demos for Complex, most notably "Origin" [12/93], which
won The Party 93 demo competition!
  1995 - Swedish sysop Ozone ('FAR OUT', 04/94) joined Classic new 06/95.
Ozone was the modem organizer. German board 'SKARA BRAE' was busted 06/95.
French graphician Eloy (ex Digital, 12/93-04/94) left for Scoopex late 95.

German graphician Noogman (08/93-04/94) joined Artwork.
Coder Stelios (mid 94) was kicked out, but joined Scoopex only to move on
  to CNCD in a matter of days!.
Peace has been kicked out.
Finnish coder Fraction got kicked.
Python (ex Byterapers) and Zoltar were kicked.
Swedes Lando and Xstaz (sysop 'THE ICE PALACE', ex Legend) both joined
  Global Overdose.
German trader Mincer (ex Adept, 03/93) left the scene.
Fabulous german musician Bit Arts (ex Sanity) left Complex, and later also
  the scene. One of the greatest losses the scene has ever suffered, IMHO...
German ex-Anarchy graphician E.Toball was kicked.
French graphician Titan (Sebire Laurent, ex Digital, 04/94) left. He was
  later in Bomb! Titan drew a great fullscreen picture for the demo "Real"
  [04/94].
German Speed (ex Mexx, new RAW6) was kicked out mid 93. He changed his
  handle to Rakiem and joined Dreamdealers.
Finnish coder Saviour (06/92-95) left to join Damones. R.A.W #6 also
  mentions Drifter, but look below for more on THAT confusion... Saviour
  worked on his commercial game "Elfmania" for about a year, before it was
  released in the summer of 1994.
Finns Guru and Stratos (both ex Decept, 07/92) left to form their own
  group; Sahara Surfers. This happened sometime between 07/92 and mid 93...
  They also seem to have joined Parallax at the same time!
German swapper Mike D. (ex Anarchy, 06/92) left the scene.
American Freddy Krueger, sysop 'BOILER ROOM' (ex Scoopex) left to join
  Global Overdose.
French coder Schmoovy Schmoov left to form Universal Soldiers with his
  friend Monty/Paradox.
Finns Zany, Open Eyes (both ex Offworld) and Papa Smurf joined Virtual
  Dreams). Due to the fact that they left, some credits in "Book of Songs"
  were omitted by Complex! See the review for more.
Four german coders; Crazy Crack (ex Mexx), Crash & Argon (both ex Adept,
  12/92-04/94) and Raw Style (code, ex Jetset, 08/94) all left to join Polka
  Brothers 12/94. Crazy Crack made the intro "A500 HOMAGE" as a sort of
  farewell to Complex before he left. Upstream #10 carried the news, but
  misspellt Crazy Crack as Crazy Jack!
Finnish musician Stargazer (07/92) decided to rejoin Sonic after just a
  brief period in Complex.
Finnish graphician Drifter (ex Cyberiad, 12/92-93) left the scene. However,
  R.A.W #6 says he rejoined Accession, and in another place that he joined
  Damones with Saviour!! Confusion status: Total.
Graphician Tomcat (ex Awesome, 06/92-04/94), who drew the great logo in
  "GOSPEL KARAOKE", joined Shining 8.
Mr.Nice Guy moved to France, and is now Mr.NGY/Delight late91.

· Skid Row Cracktro (ECS Intro).
  code: Dalton, gfx: n/a, music: Jugi.
  review: A quite basic intro, with vector renditions of the two words
  'Skid' and 'Row' twisting around on the right side of the screen, and the
  rest of it being occupied with a text plotter. Not much more to say,
  except that Jugi's tune sounds like a raped version of Codex/
  Cryptoburner's classic "Memorydust". And that font seems awful familiar...

  review: The intro part works fine, though has a few slight graphical
  errors that make the sinescroller a little hard to read... This issue of
  the mag was released a full year after the last issue was released, and
  for the first time with a new code (the last one was iff-only, like the
  old Crack Journal's) and in English. All previous issues were in Finnish
  only. First impressions are good, with a pleasant design and english that
  appears to be readable (not a given in those times! ;) But...then you try
  to read the next page, and something STRANGE happens... You can't. The mag
  forever keeps loading articles, and you never get to read a single byte
  anymore... Thankfully the text is unpacked on the disk, so I could at
  least read SOME of the it! Too bad :(
    Release date is uncertain, but certainly after april (contained party
  report from late march).

  Winner of the Society Summer Conference 92 demo competition!
  review: Tai-Pan became a celebrity nearly solely on the back of this
  single, short production. The reason for all the enthusiasm was the
  incredible (for its time) filled vector routines presented here.
  Complemented by Jugi's above average graphics and music, this became a
  great little production! The endscroller can be paused with the right

· Gospel Karaoke (1992, late .06, ECS File).
  code: Saviour, gfx: Tomcat (logo), Cockatrice (cross), Jugi (fonts),
  music: Der HM.
  review: Apparently coded in a day during a party at Jugi's house, this is
  certainly one of the best 1-day productions to ever grace the scene!
  Not only is it good, it's original too! The main feature of the demo is a
  gospel song (yes, with vocals!), and you can press the right mouse button
  to turn off the singing, and sing along yourself; hence...gospel karaoke.
  Graphics are absolutely great, as is the music. Top-notch!
    The scroller mentions several secret parts; Tetris! is mentioned...
  No release date of any kind appears in the demo, so the date reported
  here is my assumption, based on information in the scrolltext. ADL had it
  as '1992?', and that combined with them mentioning they were waiting for
  demos from the Hurricunt (Hurricane) party, arranged at at end of .06
  that year. Let's hope I'm right :) The demo requires 1mb total memory.

  review: It is always hard to review a demo you've never seen, and this
  one is no exception. It often crashes on 2.0+ and accelerated machines,
  and must surely be one of the most incompatible demos ever... Bummer :(

  review: Simple but sweet, this intro has a big raytraced animation of two
  'tannhjul' spinning, over which some text materializes. Nice design.
  This MAY be the same as COMPO INTRO, I guess, but I do not know
  100% for sure, so... The release date is based on the fact that there
  was a text BBS ad embedded in my copy of the file, dated 30.01-93.

  out the credit for their work on this! In fact, Open Eyes did all the
  fonts and one small picture, and Zany coded the hardware loader! The disk
  got its name since each song is represented as a page in a book.

  code: Crash & Argon, gfx: Hotshot, Artifex, Noogman (uncredited), music:
  "Nagual_Dance2" by Jugi and Delorean.
  Winner of the 680xx Convention 1993 demo competition!
  review: DemoManiac coders Crash and Argon prove their class in this
  great, polished demo. Graphics are generally excellent, as is the music.
  There are some very good effects here, like a large TV box (remember
  "Enigma"?), a vector world (remember "Enigma" again?) and pencil vectors
  (remember "Boggledop"?). Very very cool.
    The demo is referred to as a Mainzelmaennchen Production throughout.
  It requires 1mb total RAM, and all external drives disconnected on 1mb
  only systems. Since it failed to run on my A500/1mb/2.04, I guess you'll
  need to run a 1.2 or 1.3 system if you want to run it with only 1MB.

· Origin (1993, 28.12, AGA Trackmo, 2 disks).
  code: Gengis, gfx: Titan, Hof, Mack, Alex (raytrace), music: "Fx4" and
  "Supreme In Black" by Clawz (ProRunner 1.0 format).
  Winner of The Party 93 demo competition!
  review: "Origin" was Gengis' triumph of demomaking, with its smooth
  transitions and powerful routines - coupled with Clawz's thundering techno
  soundtrack and the combined graphical expertise of some of the foremost
  arists in the scene - ultimately bringing us a demo that was second only
  to Kefrens' outstanding "Desert Dream" [04/93] this year. It all opens
  with a loading picture, a beautiful rendition of a female in a space
  helmet done by Mack. Then the demo itself begins, with an atmospheric
  powerhouse intro sequence in which a raytraced ship touches down on the
  surface of an alien planet. Then we are suddenly inside the helm of a
  vector-robot, and go around exploring the inner workings of an entire
  solid vector city! After a while of this, we suddenly go underground
  through a hatch, and are transported through a vector-created tunnel.
  The demo's first real effect follows, a transparent gouraud vector cube,
  overlaid on a stylish patterned background. Next comes a POWER ON logo,
  before a picture is mapped onto a bouncing, elastic ball. The very same
  picture (by Axel) is then used for the zoomrotator routine that follows.
  Then we move onto a Wolfenstein-like routine which is far from fast, but
  was probably dead impressive at the time =) Then a picture by the great
  Titan of a metal man throwing a discus is composited from two parts... and
  here the demo just stops dead in its tracks. I reviewed this demo through
  a hard disk install, and it is entirely possible that this is the way it
  really ends... it just seemed a little abrupt to me =) Perhaps there's
  more, perhaps there isn't ;)
    Gengis' next - and final - demo for Complex was "Real" [04/94], before
  he and Clawz left the group to form Bomb. A sequel to this demo, "Motion:
  Origin 2" [12/94] was released a year later, but unfortunately without the
  success of the original.
    The demo does not work perfectly on 060 machines, but a WHD-Load patch
  by John Selck (Graham/Oxyron) available through aminet or the whdload page
  can fix this problem. However, when I tried this patch (v1.1) it
  unceremoniously crashed my machine... Another harddisk installer is
  available, by Zer0-X/Moses, and this worked perfectly for me.

  Winner of the Saturne Party 2 demo competition!
  review: A good early AGA demo with its high points and its lows. There
  are highlights, ofcourse, like the swirling things that fly at you during
  the opening sequence and the way the parts are linked together in the
  beginning. There are also two full screen AGA pictures by Titan and Eloy,
  that are almost worth the disk space in their own right :) Titan's picture
  is called "Synchronocity" and Eloy's is called "Artemis". They were both
  released for the graphics competition at the same party as the demo.
  Clawz' music is not his best work, but it's functional. A truly polished
  production. Recommended.

  review: Ahem. There's only two real effects here, none of which kills.
  The first is what appears to be a standard graphics zoomer which soon
  appears to be more of a meteor storm. Original, but hardly goodlooking -
  it's WAY too blocky. The second is a voxel routine with some rather...
  ehrm...interesting palette choices. The music irritates me.
    I always thought this was an AGA intro? Still, on my machine it
  requires KillAGA to work properly... To confuse us, Complex released a
  demo at Assembly 95 with the exact same name!

  review: Crazy Crack made this little intro as a farewell to Complex
  before he and the rest of the German coders took off for Polkaland.
  It is also a homage to the A500, and appropriately so since it was
  released in the first compo to have almost exclusively AGA contributions.
  There are some cool effects here, though the best is probably the
  concluding fullscreen 4 bitplane 4x4 rotzoomer, or the 4096 morphing
  dots. I like it. Right mousebutton pauses the end scroller.

  review: Technically very impressive is this intro which won the Gathering
  95 competition. It mainyl comprises of three vetor objects with light
  sourcing and MANY faces, shown animated over a huge scrolling picture -
  probably generated during the lengthy introduction text. Technically
  great, as I mentioned, but it's not very exciting is it? Boring, in fact.
  Probably the last ECS intro to win a major competition, though it
  requires at least an 020 processor. I think this requires quite a bit of
  memory...

  review: Tequila is released the first of every month, and is a chart and
  mag for the swedish modem scene. This means that the editorial content is
  not very interesting to outsiders, unfortunately. I'm sure it's essential
  reading for those it concerns, however :)
    The coder is Rioter/Equinox, the swede previously responsible for the
  "European Top 20" chart from his own group, Equinox. I really must say
  that I like this one a lot more than his first effort. Much of the praise
  for the smooth look and feel, though, must go to the person responsible
  for the graphics, Artifex. He's come up with the perfect combination of
  raytraced, animated icons and handdrawn stuff...just marvellous. Now I've
  mentioned the code and graphics, so I guess the next item on the list is
  Loxley/Equinox's great piece of music. I don't know exactly what makes it
  as good as it is, but there's a cerain sense of dynamics and vitality to
  it that puts it up. Presentation, therefore, is very very nice.

Concept
-------
ENG> Shadowman (sysop 'BONG').

Concept was a french demogroup, which never produced much of note.
  1991 The active part of the group, Performer (code), NHP  (music), BKH

(code), Zoom (gfx) and Walt (gfx) to form the french section of The Silents.

consisted only of the above 4 members.

· 64kb Intro (1995, 30.08, ECS 64k Intro).
  code: Exceed, gfx: Ellyn, music: Slaughter.
  2nd in the Intel Outside 2 64k intro competition.
  review: This intro opens with FAST filled vector cubes, filled with
  static and spacecut with the background. The music is pounding techno
  without much variation or melody, but it works ok to get the adrenalin
  pumping a little. Next there's some vector lines, which fly together to
  make shapes and tunnels. They hold onto this effect a little too long for
  my liking, before showing portraits of the three coders. Incidentally,
  Slaughter looks like he's 13 or thereabouts :) No offence, ok Slaughter?
  Then, the intro really takes off with its next screen. At the top there's
  a good Confusion logo in hues of green, and below that there's a flame
  effect. This one seems a little original, though, since it seems to take
  sidewind into consideration, making the flames swing to the side when the

    Text output is timed to the beat of the techno music throughout, and
  that coupled with an OK font and nice design give this a good feel.
  I definitely want to see more from these guys! The name given above is
  not the intro's real name; the real name is in Polish and in addition
  quite unreadable to the untrained eye :)

Contraz is a Norwegian demo group, born as a cooperation between Damage Inc.
(Overgrown etc.) and The Tanga Team in early 1995.
  2000 - Dran plans a 64k intro for The Party in december, but ultimately
decides to wait, and release it later.
  2001 - Dran and Zelow release the 64k intro "1 Week" (with music by
Frequent/Ephidrena) at Mekka Symposium 2001 in april.

  review: To the sound of a 'techno soundtrack' (and I'm being VERY kind
  here now!) a white, smiling dot-man is spinning and zooming in and out on
  a blue background. And that's it. Not exactly impressive, but I've
  certainly seen worse too.

  review: This has a definite amateur feeling to it, most of the effects are
  copper- or linevector-based, and neither the graphics nor music is up to
  scratch. An early, immature release from a group that should have waited a
  little more before releasing anything.

  Winner of the Kindergarden 6 demo competition!
  review: This seems to rely more on its scanned Arnold Schwarzenegger
  imagery than on its effects. There are a few reasonably advanced effects,
  but at this speed I'd rather be without them. The best thing about this
  demo is Nirvana's great picture "WOW", which came second in the graphics
  competition at The Gathering 95. It would have deserved to win IMHO...
    Coolest thing in the demo: Arnold pointing a BIG gun at the screen,
  with the text: Anyone mention PC? Funny, then, that they list two PC
  coders on their memberlist... The compoversion had a few bugs, so a
  bugfixed and improved version was later released.

  review: They've managed to squeeze in quite a bit into this 4k'er; not
  only is there sound (calling it music is stretching it a little :) but
  there's also a LOT of effects here, from bumpmapping variations to a
  tunnel you travel through. Not bad at all!

  review: Well, this isn't really a review, since I can't see this intro on
  my machine, because it lacks an fpu =[ What was I thinking when I thought
  I'd never need one? Anyway, apart from the FPU, this intro requires an AGA
  amiga (020+ obviously), and 16MB fast. It's not really comfortable on
  anything below an 060-50, according to the the accompanying readme file.

  Winner of the ACG Hack V demo competition.
  review: The names of the coders come spinning slowly at us in the
  beginning of this dentro, with afterburning on the letters. Next is a very
  good tunnell routine, which though it doesn't move so amazingly fast looks
  like it's among the most fluent ones I've seen. Next we're inside a torus,
  with lots of white and some color bleeding through. Next is another good
  routine, that I absolutely DO NOT know how to describe. Then a graphics
  screen show us the credits, which then dissolve into a Core Productions
  logo. Then the music ends and we are done... The music inside is not bad,
  but not terribly inspirational either. It can best be described as very
  standard trance. Overall, a very nice little demo, certainly much better
  than I anticipated!

There were two groups called Corpse, the second one coming into existence
while this incarnation was still around...


Corpse [swe] (1994-)
--------------------
SWE> Payday (founder swap).
???> Coolorado (founder), Klorathy (founder code), TBM (founder gfx).

Corpse was formed by four ex members of X-Trade; Payday, Klorathy, TBM and
Coolorado. It is very possible that TBM was later in The Black Lotus.
There were two groups called Corpse existing simultaneously, though the
French ones were the first to use the name by far...

CW seems to have been a jokey group, with mostly doublemembers from other
groups.

Ambrosia as a doublemember, and that Draw (swap) also joined.

Cracker Journal Team
--------------------
CJT is the team dedicated to the release of the legendary 'Crack Journal'
diskmag. After issue #27, internal unrest in the group Alpha Flight
prompted main editor Doctor Mabuse/AFL to take the mag and leave, so that
it would not be dependent on any one group. The first independent issue,
#28, was released in may of 1992.

· Cracker Journal #28 (1992, .05, ECS Multifile Diskmag).
  code: n/a, gfx: Quasar (main), Design (coop title), Renegade
  (endpic, comic), music: LooneStar, editors: Doctor Mabuse/Alpha
  Flight, FDT/Venture and Design.
  review: The mag opens with a small intro, just containing the text
  CRACKER JOURNAL, over which #28 comes crashing down. Then the mag
  proper appears, with a good robot picture by D-Sign appearing as the
  first thing you see. One thing you instantly notice about CJ is the
  way the mag occupies almost the entire screen; no big, impressive
  panels here!
    CJ originated in the illegal part of the scene, and is still heavily
  linked to this part of the scene. This means that your interest in
  reading CJ will always be in direct proportion with your interest in
  that part of the scene. Editorially, this is not a very strong mag
  either. There is a lot of articles that are just text files from the
  boards, the English is downright dreadful in places, and one of the
  articles is nothing but a perverse porno story! This was the middle of
  1992, mind you, and people instantly looked to magazines like R.A.W that
  were intelligible rather than the badly designed articles of CJ. Issue 28
  was the first issue to be released 'indendent', after the mag was
  liberated from its original home in Alpha Flight. Compatibility is another
  sore point, with the mag responding very badly to keypresses on my A1200 -
  even after kicking down to 1.3. It can work fine for a while, then
  suddenly decide to die. No points for guessing this made reviewing a minor
  nightmare.

     92).
???> French Connection (ex Nemesis, new RAW4), Linebacker (sysop), Skywalker
     (ex Accession).

Crack Inc was formed in early 1992 by the old european members of Skid Row
(SSR), and was soon reinforced with some other ex-Skid Row'ers from other
groups. When they died at the end of the year, most members formed Ministry
with former members of Nemesis and TKK. News that Selim and Subzero left
the scene seem to be strongly exaggerated, since they were both later
members of Ministry.
  There were rumours and even news that SSR (Subzero Selim Rudi) joined
from Bitstoppers, but it's most likely that this is untrue, and that they
were the original founders, coming directly from Skid Row. Their demo
subgroup Kaos Design died [see separate entry].

American sysop Micro ('REIGN IN BLOOD', 09/92) left sometime before 12/92.
German Munchie (ex Skid Row, new RAW3) joined Ministry.

  2nd in Amiga Conference 90 demo competition.
  review: After booting this disk you're faced with a selector for three
  different demo parts. The selector is pretty basic, with a logo at the
  top and a text writer in the middle of the screen. In the background you
  can see some vector objects, which btw are pretty fast on my 030-50 :)
  For the credits above, please refer to these codes:
  LOA means loader, in other words the selector itself. This (and only
      this) part works fine even with caches on.
  NOI means Noia demo. This is probably the best and biggest part, with
      lots of advanced (for its time) vector effects and a good sense of
      pace and entertainment. Please note that the fill routine bugs in
      some parts.
  PIG means Pigs in Space. This part consists of just a drawn 'space'
      background over which we get to see a filled vector scroller.
      The same fill bug appears here also, albeit to a lesser extent.
  MAD means The Madonna Endpart. This part excels with its superbly drawn
      cartoon renditions of Madonna walking through the city. Rather cool!
  Overall, it's a good production, this, though it seems like it was put
  together in quite a rush! It's like they got these three demoparts, and
  just stuck a loader at the beginning, and hey presto we've got a demo!
  Not bad at all, really. The music by S.L.L lifts it a lot.

Boards; THE GOLDEN GATE (nor, 11/90-01/91)

Crusaders is a legendary group, one of the oldest on the Amiga scene!
They became legends for several reasons, really. Their first innovation
must have been the creation of the 'music disk'. Yes, that's right: CRS
released the very first music disk ever. Second, their Eurochart sparked
new life in the scene, spawned about a dozen clones, and gave demo makers
another incentive to create great demos. The next thing that happened was
when Bjørn A. "Dr.Awesome" Lynne became the first professional composer to
come out of the Amiga scene. Then, of course, there's the big one; The
GATHERING! TG was originally arranged by The Crusaders, and the main
organizer has to this day always been a Crusader. They're still around,
though mostly on the PC these days, and not producing much. Their legacy
however, is huge.
  Norwegian sysop Freaky Angel's board 'THE PYRAMID' (earlier 'ANGEL CITY')
was busted in the big Norwegian boardbust in 1992.

Norwegian coder Black Panther (ex Paragon) joined Talent.
Norwegian graphician Yster (03/90-91) left.
Guardian (ex United Forces, new mid 91) left.
Norwegian swapper Zapotek (ex Gate, new 12/90) left.
American graphician and swapper Savatage (03/90) left.
American sysop Silencer ('THIS END UP', 03/91) left the scene.
Norwegian graphician Funky Guru (ex Gate, new 12/90) left the scene.
German sysop Bomber ('PEARL HARBOUR', ex Anarchy, new mid 91) left to join
  Scoopex. He opened his board while in Crusaders, though.
Norwegian sysop Lazerbrain's board 'PURPLE HAZE' was busted in the big
  Norwegian boarbust in 1992. He was the only one busted who was released
  immediately, since he had time to run a diskcrypting program before the
  police seized his equipment, and consequently they didn't find shit on
  his board. He probably continued to be a member.
Norwegian sysop One (old handle Scratcher, ex Fairlight)'s board 'TOTAL
  PANIC' was busted in the big Norwegian boardbust in 1992. He joined Angels
  and reopened the board, though under a new name?
Norwegian graphician Joachim (ex Marvel/Static Bytes, 93) joined Andromeda
  (RAW6). ...and perhaps Jason did too?
Norwegian swapper ECS (03/90) left and is now independent.

  review: Oh my god, THE FIRST EUROCHART!! This is history. Slagging this
  off would be sacrilege, surely! Ok, I'll try to be objective about it.
  The presentation's not much, to be honest. There's a selector screen,
  where you manouver a large crusifix around with your mouse, to select the
  section you want. It was a long way from this to what we have today.
    Trivia note: Ipec Elite were actually the first to do a chart, as the
  scroller in this production informs us.

  review: With the third issue of the Eurochart, things took a turn for the

  are quite adequate for the most part, and Fleshbrain's music (his first
  for this group, this was his introduction as a new member) is among his

  review: Again, nothing much has changed from the previous issue in what

  percentile to show how many votes each entry got. There's also [new]
  icons and up/down arrows to signify if this placing is better or worse
  than the previous one. The tune fails to set me alight, as does the gfx.

  the sections now actually represent the TOP TWENTY most popular things.
  Other than that, there's not a lot to complain about, really. Another
  good issue, which feels nice and smooth - just like it should be :)
  The tune is not one of Fleshie's best, though.
    Works fine even without KillAGA, though the music sounds a little
  strange sometimes...

  review: Another oldie that doesn't work anymore. As far as I can
  remember, this one was rather good. The main event, sort of, is an
  animation of Calvin from the comic strip Calvin & Hobbes, that's rather
  fun and humourous. I got the credits by ripping a few parts off the disk,
  but this did not result in ripping EVERYTHING. There are several parts,
  and I can't remember them all now... Anyway, worth a look if you've got
  an A500 lying around...or a good, new degrader!

  review: The revolution! With issue 8, the Eurochart sported some major
  overhauls to the code, as well as two full new sections in addition to
  the charts! The Gallery and EuroNews were born... Graphics by Bustman are
  some of his best yet, and oh, did I mention the absolutely fabulous tune
  by Dr. Awesome? I didn't? It's just lovely. It incorporates themes from
  many of his earlier songs into a sort of medley-type-thing. The 'feel' of
  the mag also seems improved, it now feels almost perfect. A milestone for
  the Amiga scene, and a great production any which way you look at it!
  By the way, the news item about the new Amiga sound chip 'Mary' sounded
  more like wishful thinking to us ;)
    Starting this one was the cause of a few hiccups, since it tries to
  allocate memory at some specific addresses, and newer Amigas do not
  always have their memory where the old ones did ;) The only real solution
  I found was to boot without caches, chipset original, and without
  startup-sequence. Then the mag ran perfectly from my harddisk :)

· Eurochart issue #11 (1991, 01.07, ECS Multifile Chartmag).
  code/editor: El Cubo, gfx: Intec, music: "Neodrink" by Fleshbrain (4ch
  ProTracker format).
  review: Legendary doesn't quite cover it when it comes to the EC.
  It was a milestone of the scene, and gave coders, painters and composers
  everywhere a new incentive to get better. This issue is certainly not the
  worst, with acceptable graphics from Intec and OK music by Fleshbrain.
  One thing that I found cool about the EC was that they had new graphics
  for every issue. They had the (basically) same code, but there were
  always a new design on the control board. This is not the best one,
  neither is it the worst. This issue marks the arrival of a new editor,
  since Dr.Awesome decided he want to leave the scene.
    During testing the mag has proven somewhat unstable on my accelerated
  system. I have found it works best when run from disk. When installing to
  harddisk, or running from RAM:, it seems it has problems with the loading
  taking too little time, and often crashes. KillAGA has no positive effect
  when run from hard or RAM, and isn't necessary for disk running.

  info: This was the last issue released by Crusaders before they officially

  legacy. Therefore, issue #15 was an STB product.

  The Gathering 92 Invitation (1992, early .01, ECS Intro).

· The Gathering 92 Reminder (1992, early, ECS File).
  code: Switchblade, gfx: various, music: "Prophet 2001" by Bjørn A. 'Dr.
  Awesome' Lynne (4ch MOD format)..
  review: A simple little intro-demo this, to remind people to go to The
  Gathering in 1992. Enough people must have been reminded, 'cause it's
  still being arranged every easter :) I'll have to base this review
  largely on memory, 'cause the introduction, where some good pictures
  are shown, just FLASHES by on my machine :) Oh well, I guess that's the
  price you pay for accelerating :D It opens with some cool strings, the
  opening bars of Bjørn Lynne's fabulous soundtrack. Then, as the tune
  takes a turn for the heavier with a guitar riff, we're shown some
  pictures of earlier productions and some humourous text ('You've seen the
  flapping toilets... now come to the party!'). Then you're shown some
  pages of text, and... Nothing more happens. It's not going to set the
  world alight with it's awesome code, but it's still GOOD in its own way..
  Worth getting for the tune.

                Note: While it works perfectly, the intro sequence is too
                fast to see what's going on!

· The Gathering 93 Invitation (1993, early, ECS 1MB File).
  code: Switchblade, gfx: Intec (blow-up logo), Joachim, music: "Minimum_
  Penetration" by Jason (4ch MOD format).
  review: This year the Crusaders presented a very good invitation intro
  for The Gathering, with some new ideas. The show opens with some guy
  pumping a Crusaders logo full of air, and then goofily alking across the
  screen. The invititation part itself is very easy to control, with a set
  of icons with text on them in the middle of the screen to click on.
  Most of them will take you to a page of text - you can also just flip
  through all the text with your cursor keys - while some also have some
  extra functions. One really nice thing is the aforementioned 'tour of the
  hall' part, where you control a little...err...animal-thing :) around a
  blueprint of the hall, and the various areas are explained as you get to
  them. A really nice, new idea! A top-notch invitation intro with a good
  sense of humour!
    The intro requires almost all of chipmem on a 512k chip machine, and
  300k of some other ram. It therefore needs at least 1mb total mem.
  though it worked fine on my 030 machine, it did run WAY too fast. For
  example, the 'tour of the hall' part was almost uncontrollable, and
  some of the intermission screens flashed by before I was able to read
  what was on them. A dose of KillAGA fixes everything, though.

Crux was formed by its main organizer Shane not with the intention of being
a cracking group only, but also with a demo section. The demo section was
dubbed "Crux Design", and was officially started around 1997.
  They recruited great demo reinforcements in the old Rebels coders Zulu &
Grey, after they had been inactive on the scene for some months, which in
their time were responsible for such classics as "Switchback" [10/94] and
"Whammer Slammer" [12/94] for Rebels.
  Unusually enough, they have TWO subgroups; The Frog Buds (TFB) and Dylem.
They were at one time in (illegal) cooperation with Bad Karma, using the
acronym CBK (Crux Bad Karma). There were rumours that the illegal Crux DIED,
leaving only the demo section, "Crux Design" active. Can anyone confirm or
deny this?

  sure made many an attendee laugh when it was shown on the big screen.
  And at the end it tacks on an advertisement for Mekka Symposium 1998 ;)

Cryptoburners was formed in 1988 by by two earlier C64 groups, going under
the names Scandomatic Crackers and TWCA. The original founders were
Windwalker and Heatseeker, but they immediately recruited Trixal, Time
Traveller, Blackstar and Bimbex. For a while, they released the diskmag
'Fourth Dimension'.
  It is worth mentioning that several leading members of Cryptoburners were
involved in starting the gamemaking firm FunCom in Oslo, Norway. People
like Tec, Vishnu and Olorin were and are heavily involved in the leader-
ship of the company. Unlike stated in RAW #2, Vectorman was NOT kicked due
to inactivity.
  1989 - In August the entire group Ghostriders joined.
  1992 - After a spell of relative inactivity, PMC and New Wave's diskmag
"R.A.W #2" [02/92] caught up with TEC to check on the group. He explained in
an article that the recent lull in activities was mostly due to members
doing their military duty (a.o. Heatseeker was facing 15 months in the
navy). He could also disclose that a clean-up operation that was in
progress, where lazy members would be disposed of - and that was Vectorman
was one of these people. Tec said there would be an internal meeting in the
group at easter time, and that no releases would be made before that time.
Norwegian sysop Chameleon ('CREEPSHOW') was busted sometime this year =).

  review: For the first time, this issue of Fourth Dimension was a
  cooperation release, incorporating Razor 1911 into the team. Their
  contributions to the mag itself seems scarce, though, probably the best
  aspect of their contribution is the nice intro and a couple of articles
  by Sector9 and Ziphoid. What's more, the next issue promises to add
  another member to the team: Rebels.
    So, what do I think of the mag itself? At half the amount of articles,
  this would be a good mag. As it is now, however, there are simply WAY too
  many 'humoristic' articles and cartoons, of no interest to anyone but the
  producers themselves.

Crystal was formed in 1991, likely by Scott (scotland) and I.B.M. (denmark).
The group became known from day one as one of the best cracking groups in
the business, and I.B.M (originally from Poland, real name Roman) was their
main cracker for years and years. Another dane, Harmonica, also did a fair
few cracks for the group. The group's main supplier was Englishman 2tuff
(also known under several other handles, a.o. Tutoff and Ghetto Boy).
  The group itself never produced any demos, but their subgroup for a while,
Melon Dezign (see separate entry) certainly made some memorable demo
releases. Melon was also responsible for many, many of the best crackintros
ever, almost all for Crystal. There are reviews of some of these under
Melon's entry.
  There is some confusion around the 'OASIS' boards; in addition to the
information above, I also have a bbs ad and other supporting information
that reads sysop: Dan/Crystal...

Crystal is dead!
Tango/Defekt joined, but left to join Balance.
Cardinal (ger? ex Abyss, cosysop 'WORLD DOWN FALL', new 09/92) left for
  Interpol. It is unclear where this left 'WDF', where he was cosys with
  Protektor.
'BLACK TOWER' was closed forever, reported Eternal #2. This may be a
  misprint, so that they actually meant Rash' 'DARK TOWER'...
'EDGE OF INSANITY' was busted 93, and will go offline forever!
German Fulcrum (new late 92) joined, but left due to differences with
  Cardinal and Protektor.
German swapper Ghost (ex Submission) joined Dytec.
English board 'GRACELAND' (05/92) joined from Ghost briefly, and then left
  the scene.
Swedish sysop Princip ('INTERCHANGE', ex Shining 8, new 09/92) soon joined
  Kefrens.
sysop ZigZag ('MAY DAY', ex Symbiosis, new 09/92) joined Crack Inc, but soon
  went on to join Scoopex.
DD7 (sysop '100 PERCENT') joined 2000 AD and opened 'VALHALLA' BBS with
  Ozzy.
Scottish supplier Action Man had a falling out with I.B.M. over Zelnik, and
  subsequently he, Infiltrator, N.O.M.A.D (ex Angels old or Scoopex) and
  Zelnik left for Quartex (91).

     Light), Tarzan (Peter Nielsen, swap sysop 'PLASTIC PASSION', ex Light,
     later 2000 AD, 92).

     Vogue), Dr.Legal (ex RAF, new mid91), Droid (den? music, 92), Jacx
     (music, 12/92), Magic Duke (ger? music, later G.T.O/Digital, 92), Max

     Predator (gfx, 12/92), Ray (code, 12/92), Red Lance, Trance.

Boards; SANCTUARY (den, 91).

Action Force changed its name to Cult, and that's how this group was born.
They're mainly remembered for their demos now.
  1990 - The Norwegian section fell apart in late 1990 (probably december);
Beast, Skeletor, Mad, SwEinstein and Yoghurt (old handle Acidman) all joined
Network; Timewalker (music) joined Pure Metal Coders; Space Ace (swap,
late90) changed his handle to Mr.Ice and formed a norwegian section of
Euphoria, and finally Electrix and three others will form a new group.
  1992 - Around the middle of the year, danish sysop Energy ('NONSTOP UP'N
DOWN') left the group for 2000 A.D. Danish Gizmo left to join Bastards ca
06/92. Danes Dino (gfx), Slide (music), Mount (gfx), Easley (gfx swap),
Shayera and Gargoyle (code) all left to form Parasite 06/92. News in both
EuroChart #15 [07/92] and #16 [09/92] seem to confirm Cult's death. It is
claimed this is in agreement with both the German and Danish sections of the
group. What confuses me somewhat is how they could release "Kefmania"
[09/92] if they were dead at the time?

German sysop Hotstar ('THE NEW STATION', ex RAF) joined Rebels.
Dutch editor Cybersonik joined Anarchy. Cybersonik left behind a few issues
  as editor of 'Royal Info'. It is probable that no more issues were
  released after Cybersonik left.
Danish coder and musician Kollaps (ex Light, 92) left to help form the new
  group Focus Design.

Culture
-------
FIN> Dalos (Pasi Rainio, swap, 09/92), SS Soldier (swap).


Curacy
------
DEN> Ajax (Martin Jacobsen, swap, ex Vendetta Prod. ad X-Tra), Foxtrot

Cyanide was a Dutch demo group.
  1993 - German musician Dynamite joined Analog 03/93. Murdock joined Jetset
mid 93. Cyanide died late 1993, and all Dutch members joined Applause. This
means at least Radium (gfx music, 03/93) and Sascha.

TLE left the scene.
Tommie, sysop 'SESAMESTRAAT' joined Desire.
Englishmen Psi and St.M, as well as the american Caffeine joined Eclipse.
Dutch swappers Magic (ex Xentrix) and Amethist (both 08/93) joined Applause.

GER> 2Fast (Jens, ascii, doublememb Cream [console], 08/95).


Cyberiad
--------
FIN> Cocatrice (gfx, 04/92), Cody, Zei-El (gfx, 04/92).

Cyberiad later merged with Carillon into Carillon Cyberiad (CNCD), which
means most of the members above can later be found in that group. Accurate
information on exactly WHO made it across would be greatly appreciated :)
Some confirmed ones, however, are Fraction (code, 04/92), Dean (music,
04/92) and Prime Premium (gfx music, 04/92).

Drifter joined Complex.

Cyborgs
-------
NOR> Dark Pirate, Highlight (Tommy Foss, org swap, later Decnite).
???> Darkman (swap, ex Beast/Bronx).

Despite strong rumours, Cyborgs did NOT die in late 92 or early 93.
There was also an Atari division.

Cytax was a german based demo group, which died late 1992. They will be most
fondly remembered for their excellent diskmag 'International Computer
Entertainment' (I.C.E.). The last issue or two of the mag was detached from
Cytax, and released as an independent production.
  1992 - Zed joined Slipstream 09/92. Germans Bros and Master (both new
mid91) left to join The Silents 09/92. Swedish musician and swapper Noice
(ex Antiriad, old handle Lucky Strike, 06/92) and female swapper Wiquie
joined Polaris 09/92.

Torwak was kicked.
Maltese writer Cyber Pirate joined Pure Metal Coders, to be one of the
  writers for their legendary diskmag 'R.A.W'.
Parsec (had board, but closed), Flogger, Thunor and Rainbow joined Voice.
4T Thieves joined Alcatraz.
Swedish sysop Princip ('INTERCHANGE') joined Kefrens.
Norwegian swapper Moxy (new mid 91) joined Offence.
Gadget (ex Airwalk) left due to internal problems and joined Palace for two
  days, though some sources claim he went directly to New Wave.

  code: The Mage/independent, gfx: Ken (title), Decre (icons, headline
  fonts, clips), Mithrandir/Acme (clips), Nana (cartoons), music: Rhesus
  Minus/Cryptoburners, editors: Leo, Blackghost, Amphetamine, The
  Mage/independent.
  review: The first things this mag shows you is a single screen of a
  copyright notice, then a really great fantasy HAM title picture by Ken.
  First impressions of the mag itself isn't bad either, with a small but
  great ICE clipart logo and big and small fonts... The control panel is
  hardly stunning, but more than functional. ICE is based in Germany, but
  with some international cooperatives. They do claim it's no longer a pure
  Cytax production (the editorial even criticizes the group's lack of
  activity), but the production roster still contains so many Cytax members
  I think it's most correct to list even this issue under Cytax.
    The release date is a little uncertain, but it is around may or june of
  1992. The news section carried the news that Horizon, Ian/Dytec and
  Joker/Anthrox had joined.
