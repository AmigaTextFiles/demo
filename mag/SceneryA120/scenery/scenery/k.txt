-
N-L> Infant (code, triplememb Subspace [details] and Kinky), Iso (music).

K was thought out by the two dutchmen Infant and Iso as a label under which
they could release the productions that were too weird for the mainstream
demo crowd :)

  Amiganica Hungarica 98 Party Invitation (1998, early.05, Intro).
  code: EFT, gfx: Soldier, music: M. info: Supposed to be spread at Scenest
  98, but that party was cancelled, and so it was released out of party.
  Size approximately 1meg.

  Intro (1999, late.01, 64k Intro).

  2nd in the Contest 99 intro competition.

 United (2000, .08, AGA Dentro).
  code: EFT, gfx: Beast, Cheetah, music: Teo.
  review: I was anxiously awaiting to see this, since EFT has been a
  personal favorite since releasing "Voyage In Storm". But, alas, the intro
  does not seem to work. When executed it just throws up a white screen and
  then takes FOREVER to do anything...and ultimately never does. I have not
  yet been able to make it do anything, but when I do...I'll get back to
  you, ok? I'm sad now =(

Kefrens [old] (1988-1990)
-------------------------
DEN> Box (gfx, 09/89), JTF (gfx, 09/89), Razter (code, 09/89).

Kefrens was a Danish demo group, originally founded by Razmo, Metallion and
Mellica in 1987 under the name The Starlight Project (TSP). In 1988, they
changed their name to Kefrens.
  When Kefrens died, danish coder Promax (Rune Gram-Madsen, ex Atomic
Team) left the demo scene to work on his assembler ASM-One...and today
ASM-One is the most used assemblers among demo coders! Also Metallion had
some utility projects; his IFF Converter was widely used among demo coders
at the time.
  1988 - Razmo contributed music to Freedom Force's "Demo 2" [10/88] in
october.
  1989 - At least three megademos were released by the group this year, from
number 5 (february) to number 7 (september)! This is undoubtedly a record,
and one that will remain for all time.

Kefrens died. R.W.O (1st group), S.L.L (ex Bamiga Sector One, both new
  02/90) and Seen joined Rebels. However, after 14 days they both left and
  formed Hydronic together with 4 other ex-Kefrens guys. Then, of course,
  Hydronic became the new Kefrens. I believe Razmo may have spent some time
  in Genozide also. Danes Icronite (old handle Burger) and Milkshake (both
  ex Atomic Intelligence) joined Rebels, but immediately moved on to
  Anarchy. Deflex joined Arcane. Toxic founded his own little crew; Serious
  Soft. Neon changed his handle to Hitman and joined Dexion.
Danish members Detron (code, 09/89), Jaeger (swap), Metallion (code, 09-
  11/89) and Nightlight (music, ex  Atomic Team) remain groupless after the
  split.
Danes Maestro (music, 12/92), Orion (code) and Slash (gfx, ex Daniax, new
  12/90) all left to join Flash Production. This trio was largely
  responsible for the demo 'THE WALL' (12/90). Maestro later returned to
  the new Kefrens.
Original founder and coder Mellica was kicked mid 90.
Danish coders Gizwiz (ex Bounty) and Murphy joined Crionics 06/90.

one of the biggest cracker groups on the Amiga around 1987, when the Amiga
was new... Many members later helped form the group Quoram.


KGB (1989-)
-----------
DEN> A.Azap (music), U-235 (Tom Iversen, code), ZX68 (code).

KGB was a danish group originally formed on the Spectrum, which then
migrated to the Amiga. Please note that there were at least two other groups
using this name, but below is the 'official' list of releases for THIS one
;), sent directly to me by U-235 (who used to be known as Spirit/Dominators
on the c64 btw...!)
  1992 - They gained and lost their member NBR (gfx) this year. Swapper
Passion joined, but left the following year.

  code: Piark (end), gfx: Momo (objects), music: Gandbox.
  2nd in the Belgian Scene Event 97 40k intro competition.
  review: I really don't get this one... It opens normally enough, with
  brief credits and a Kiki logo, set to a chippy...which then suddenly goes
  silent as we're shown a white dot-BSE logo soinning...and is that it?
  What? And is Piark coded the endpart, who coded the rest? I really, really
  don't understand this.

???> SubStance (n-l?, org music, 06-09/97).

A mag released late 95 carried the news that Kinky changes its name to

Kinky productions released after this, so some confusion exists...
