Swedish Nick (ex Mute 101, new late 90) joined Cascade.

Wipe vs Zif Experience (WZE)
----------------------------
· The Law (1997, 28.12, AGA 40k Intro).
  Production: Wipe, Zif, Virgill.
  15th in The Party 97 40k intro competition.
  review: "The Law" came as a positive surprise,given how long down the
  list it finished at TP. I wasn't expecting much of anything, but got an
  above average, technically interesting little intro. It even contained an
  effect I haven't seen before; a phongshaded voxel! Other cool effects
  included a shaded plane flying around. If these guys get a genuine
  graphician aboard (to create some actual palettes for them!) they could
  very well be headed for bigger things. Not bad at all.
    The intro opens with a quote from Aleister Crowley, and continues with
  a shaded pentagram. These guys obviously do not go to sunday mass a lot.
  Clearly intended for a faster processor than mine.

  code: Dreamer, Xenon (intro), gfx: Skywalker, Mindblaster, music:
  NoiseReduction.
  review: A perfectly accurate title for this slideshow of cartoon-like
  pictures. They range from hilarious to the absolutely tasteless. I guess
  your enjoyment of this disk will depend entirely on your sense of humour.
  There's also an intro, accessed by pressing the left mouse button during
  boot, which didn't work on my machine. Fun, but limited fun.

???> Cloudy (ex Talent).

Boards; KLONDYKE (fin), FATAL BEAUTY (fin).

The sysop information for 'LIGHT HOUSE' came from a BBS ad without specific
group support. I just searched the entire Scenery, and found the BBS here,
so I assumed the sysop hadn't changed :) The ad file was dated 26-sep-93.
The Finnish group Decnite was formed by ex members of this group.

Paranoimia was built on the ashes. Among the ones who went along to
Paranoimia were Kontrasoft, Metallica, Hellion and Corsair. The numbers for
the WOW HQ BBS (718-234-3659/259-9661) are identical to the numbers for the
FBI BBS in Paranoimia.
  1988 - Oli was caught for phreaking in december. Representatives for MCI
called his parents.

     earlier dFX, 08/96), Neuro (gfx, 08/96), Odie (music, 06/96).

Wrath Designs is a primarily swedish group, presumably with a few things in
common with the smae-named group on the c64... Detective work has revealed
previous groups for some of the participants in the excellent "Gyrate" demo.

· Gyrate (1996, 18.08, AGA 4MB File).
  code: Dep, gfx: Wolf, Neuron, music: Elixir (The Player 6.1A format).
  11th in The Assembly 96 demo competition.
  review: Now, this ain't half bad! It's a little different in the sense of
  the way things are designed, which I suppose is what made it end up as
  low as it did in the competition. This is clearly a better production
  than its ranking would suggest! All routines are good and fast, and they
  all look good. As mentioned earlier, the design is unorthodox, and this
  gives the demo a very special 'feel'. It's hard to describe, but it's a
  good one :) Graphics by Neuron and Wolf contribute a lot to the feel of
  the demo, and it's clear that they both contributed to the look and feel
  of the finished product. However, the picture of the girl in the white
  top by Wolf carries the text 'Wolf 96', which is totally wrong. Ok, so
  the picture's been given a new frame, but he still competed with it at
  The Party 94, where it was called "Light"...
    There's not enough memory to run this demo on my system with just 4mb
  of fast, but this is probably because I use 512k of the mem to map ROM to
  fastmem for a speed increase.
