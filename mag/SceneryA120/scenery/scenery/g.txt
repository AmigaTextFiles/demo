The Gang is the group that pissed off the entire Scandinavian demoscene
when their coder The Cracker gave an interview for the papermag
Datormagazin basically claimed he could do anything better than anyone
else...and failed to prove it. The Gang eventually joined forces with the
cooperation group Triangle, and participated in the making of a few of
their demos. They have one more bbs; 'BAD REPUTATION'.

Gate was a finnish based demo group.
  1990 - When Image was formed 06/90, finnish graphician and swapper Der HM
joined them from Vision One. In december most of the finnish and Norwegian
sections joined Anarchy, and Gate died. Wraith was their previous leader,
but joined the pack to Anarchy. These joined: Octoplex (swap), Laiz (swap),
Golem (gfx, 05/90), Griffon (music, 05/90), Psycho (code, 05/90), Wraith
(code, 05/90) and Bruno (music, 05/90).

Norwegians Intec (gfx), Zapotek (swap) and Funky Guru (gfx, all ex Zombie

  Review: Cool! For a megademo from 1990, this is not bad at all. There's
  several stars-to-be appearing here. Bruno became big, Golem did good
  later on... It opens with an 'animation' (3 frames :) of a monk opening
  a Gate, before the text 'Gate Megademo II' is overlayed. The loader part
  is unspectacular, just a Golem picture with a priest and the GMDII text.
  The first part is the BOB-part. 16col animated bobs flying around to a
  cool tune by Griffin. Not a bad opening at all! Great for its time.

  for the Pro-Wiz button like a rabbit for a carrot! Intec later made a lot
  of good graphics for Crusaders, a.o. in the Eurochart.
    This demo was supposed to compete in the demo competition at the No

  Since it did not, it's a fair assumption it was released a little later?

---------------------
Genesis was an illegal cracker group based in the UK, who were born by
Scott, Action Man and Mr.E from Oracle and N.O.M.A.D and Infiltrator from
Scoopex in september 1990 . They did a few releases in cooperation with
Angels and Defjam.
  I guess when three of their crackers (N.O.M.A.D, Mr.E and I.B.M) and one
important sysop (Scott, 'DULCET TONES') joined Angels (which was one of the
groups they were in cooperation with) late 1990 it was all pretty much over.
Scottish supplier Action Man left to help form Crystal.

English Scooter (ex Oracle?) joined Classic old late 90.
American sysop Allister Friend ('TOTAL RECALL', ex Oracle old) left.

I always found the Giants slogan 'Giants - We Are Huge' to be rather
amusing... News way back in Generation #6 claiming all members had joined
Interactive in Germany are probably untrue...except if they all moved to
Germany and joined up :) Hawk and one other coder (real name Fredrik

Norway joined. Any info on who this involves?

  review: Fast, good-looking routines and a heavy metal soundtrack. That's
  what these Swedes are offering, and it's not bad either. The rather
  uninspired soundtrack aside, the main showcase here are the effects.
  Most notable is a morphing/bitmap manipulation routine that's really
  good. Other cool effects are a standard voxel landscape and a plasma
  rot-zoomer. Recommended.

Gods was originally a French demo group, which also eventually got good
divisions in Norway and Germany. The group died around march 1998, as a
result of several very important members leaving. First Sixpack left for
Haujobb, then German swapper, trader, packer and sysop of their WHQ 'LOS
ENDOS', Ghandy (ex Bonzai Brothers, late96-early97), decided to end his
double membership to a Darkage-only member. Next Caramel left the group,
with no certain destination, and English trader Lithium (ex Eltech, new
late96) left the scene. After their death was a fact, English graphician
Wade (ex Eltech, new late96) joined Nerve Axis. XBarr has, though it was
stated so elsewhere, not left the scene. He has however, most probably begun
working as a coder on the PC rather than for the Amiga anymore. I believe he
is now in Syndrome on the pc.
  Check out Bridgeclaw's homepage (http://members.xoom.com/bridgeclaw/) for
some amazing pieces of art! Just CHECK out his latest work, seems like

  1995 - German musician The Loop left for Artwork in december.
  1996 - In april Xanth was kicked out of the French section, and they
announced that Wilsh was never a member since they don't allow doublemembs
anymore. French graphician Geist (06/96) left to be a Balance only member
late in the year. News in Ethic's "X-Files #11" [11/96] that Ghandy and
Sixpack had left for Syndrome were incorrect.
  1997 - Artwork's "Generation #24" [04/97] reported that norwegian Typhoon/
Avalon (gfx) joined.
  1998 - English sysop Zoltrix ('SPACED OUT', new late97) left in february.
  2000 - Norwegian graphician Bridgeclaw doublejoined Darkage early in the
year.
  2001 - In the early part of the year, Norwegian swapper Punisher joined
from Apathy and Darkage.

Norwegian sysop Sealapex ('PITSTOP'/'CLIFFHANGER' WHQ, 11/94-late96) sold
  his Amiga, so he left the scene. 'LOS ENDOS' is the new WHQ, 'DIGITAL

· A Few Good Men - A Little Slideshow (1995, 04.06, AGA Multif. Slideshow).
  code: Zytrox, gfx: Bridgeclaw, music: Eagle.
  review: AFGM doesn't have the most impressive coding in the world, and I
  really don't like the music in this one either... It gives a cold,
  clinical feel for some reason, and I can in no way manage to be moved by
  the dire opening sequence. After a few gods - presents - screens, we
  arrive at the main menu. This is in monochrome, with the thumbnailed
  pictures choosable by mouse. You can also choose to run through all the
  pictures in a slideshow mode, if you wish. Another thing that annoys me
  about this slideshow is the fact that the pictures only stay on the screen
  for a few seconds, far too little time to get a proper impression of their
  quality =( I personally had to view several pictures more than once to get
  a good look, and I much prefer a system where it doesn't return to the
  menu before you press a mouse button. After all, slideshows are supposed
  to be about the art, and it really is a problem when you cannot get the
  time to properly view the art. It's like if a gallery opens its doors, and
  then the guards push you back out after 15 seconds =) Simplistic code
  (just music and a graphics shower, that's all) and unengaging music aside,
  this slideshow is still worth getting for the pictures. Even if the
  quality is uneven, there are still gems like "Warrior" and "Future Title"
  to savour...
    There are 12 pictures to choose from on the main menu, and we're going
  to go through them one by one. "Pitstop Title" (64c) is not one of his
  best, with unrealistic anatomy and hair for a lying-down female, and a
  real lame 'PITSTOP' logo. "Illusionia" (64c) is much better, a dreamy
  picture of a girl's face seemingly suspended in the air. Much better hair
  on this picture. "Levelling The Land" (128c) is a picture of a middleaged
  man's face. Again the proportions of the face are a little off, though the
  picture displays a sharer style than in the previous two. The hair looks
  unnatural here too. "Warrior" (64c) contains a female cartoon-style
  warrior and a vertical DISC logo, and was probably used as a title picture
  for DISC #9. This is the best picture yet, as Bridgeclaw seemingly masters
  the semi-cartoon style much better. Nothing to remark on the full-body
  proportions, excellent. "Maldi" (64c) is another facial portrait, this
  time of a smiling black guy. Again, the proportions of the face are way
  off, nothing much else to remark about this one. "Monster" (64c) is the
  least impressive of all the pictures included, and looks like an early
  sketch for an abandoned picture. "No Aloha" (64c) is yet another facial
  portrait, and this one looks a lot like actor Kevin Spacey to me... but I
  may be mistaken. In fact, it resembles "Levelling The Land" more than just
  a little. "Good Old" (64c) is a strange portrait, of a strange man... It
  shows improved technique, and an almost believable facial proportion (we
  can excuse a few glitches here, since this is clearly not the face of a
  normal person). "The God" (64c) has a great gothic GODS logo suspended
  over a straight-on diabolical face with an evil grin... =) "Steel" (64c)
  is a cyber-woman rendition, of the kind made popular by a Japanese artist
  whose name I can't quite remember right now... =) ...damn! Well, anyway,
  it's a female robot (breasts'n'all), and I'm sure most of you know what
  kind I'm talking about. "The Curse" (128c) is a much more complete picture
  than most of the others here, again employing a cartoon style, not unlike
  what was done for "Warrior". Among the best pictures in this slide. The
  final picture is also the best of the collection; "Future Title" (64c).
  This, in a rare departure from his usual people-dominated pictures,
  depicts a spaceship in (duh!) space... It clearly shows Bridgeclaw's
  progression as an artist, and serves as the perfect conclusion for an
  otherwise uneven slideshow.
    After clicking the icon for the endpart, we get another little picture
  with a GODS logo in the background, with an upscroller running over it.
  The entire slideshow ran without a glitch from floppy on my configuration.

  review: I'm sorry, but I'm rather unimpressed by Gods' mag. What bugs me
  the most actually, is how much POTENTIAL there is here, and how little
  has been made of it. The interviews had so much going for them to be
  interesting, but fail. Just to think what an editor like Mop could have
  done to these articles... This just plain and simple doesn't have the
  'edge' that's required to be great.
    Why on earth it demands a 020 or faster is totally beyond me, since it
  doesn't contain ANYTHING new that mags in 1990 didn't have. We've seen it
  before oh so many times...

  tormenting us with JP, Gods...please?

· Energy - Fraction II (1997, 29.03, AGA HD File).
  code: Odin, XBarr, gfx: Bridgeclaw, Typhoon, XBarr (obj), music: Liszt.
  5th in The Gathering 95/11th in the Mekka Symposium 1997 demo competition.
  review: Overall, I didn't find Energy too exciting. Large portions of
  the opening is made up of vectors, which should have been a lot smoother
  with this kind of machine power. Also other effects tend to jerk along a
  little, creating an 'unfinished' feel to the production.
    Highlights definitely include the stairwell at the conclusion of the
  demo, with its bumpmapped walls and envmapped handles :) Other highlights
  were the two excellent pictures by Typhoon and Bridgeclaw, though the
  latter looked like it had some raytracing in there...amazingly enough,
  when you consider the motive! Probably requires some fast.

· Magical Box (1996, 08.02, AGA Intro).
  Code: Kaneda, Gfx: Kaneda, Blunt (title), Music: Kaneda (title), Bliss
  (magical), Wilsh (end).
  Review: Ahh, like a breath of fresh air I welcome Magical Box from GHD!
  With one small, funny, little production they seem to poke their nose at
  everything that's currently hot and cool on the amigascene! Especially
  the system tester was great fun, with its 'post-calculating' after the
  intro was over...! I won't spoil MB for you, just recommend you download
  it...and when it stops doing anything and there's just the box on the
  screen, move your mouse. Be careful not to break it :) Recommended.
    You didn't really expect me to give a bad review to a production
  released on my birthday, did you ;)

  Contribution for 40k intro competition at The Party 5.
  Review: These guys obviously go out of their way to be different. It's
  the first intro I've ever seen that zoom-rotates old expressionist
  paintings, or has a 'Buck Rogers' scroll (it's VERY similar to a Star
  Wars scroll :). Fun, but not terribly good.
