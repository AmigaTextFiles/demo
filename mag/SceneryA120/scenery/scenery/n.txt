Nah Kolor was originally formed in the middle of 1995 by the Polish section
of TRSI to serve as their demosection - like Surprise! Productions and
Masque had in the past. However, the plans had not been correctly cleared
with the leaders of TRSI, and at The Party 5, Nah Kolor was given the
choice of being real TRSI members or leaving in favour of this new group.
The result was that Norby and Bald Horse decided to stay in TRSI, and that
the rest continued as Nah Kolor. Blaze doublejoined from Floppy to help
organize the team after QBA's recent lack of activity.
  1996 - They lost a valuable asset when the Polish celebrity graphician
Lazur left them for Anadune in the middle of 1996. He did help out with some
productions after that though, like "Episode" [08/97]. Dutch coder and sysop
Infant (ex New Age) left after one week (late 96) because Magic's attitude
was commanding everyone around. This led to him rejoining Session and
releasing an intro for them at The Party 6.
  1997 - Finnish musician Muffler (new 02/96) joined Haujobb 05/97. While he
was a member of Nah Kolor, he worked on the cooperation musicdisk "Moments"
[11/96] with Dreamer.
  1998 - Polish swapper Blaze (doublememb Floppy) joined Endzeit in june...
In November Klod won the 64k intro competition at Satellite 2 with "Worms
From My Head" [11/99]. In the following month, at The Party they released
the 40k intro "Dive" [12/99], which finished sixth. Spanish musician Estrayk
(doublememb from Capsule 01/98) is no longer a member.
  2000 - The early year saw the release of one of the best new mags in a
LONG time, "Devotion #1" [00]. Inside they announced that Virgill had joined
as a triplemember, that Nop (code) had been asked to leave and that Juen
(code) had joined.

Graphician Yoga joined Scum.
Polish swapper Action joined Anadune.
Polish graphician Fame (08/96-08/97) decided to end his double membership to
  stay in Floppy.

· Speed Packmenu (1995, AGA Menu).
  code: Bald Horse, gfx: Lazur, Comanche/OBS (font), music: various,
  editor: QBA.
  review: The single most outstanding thing about this menu is certainly
  its graphics - Lazur is the Polish #1 for a REASON! The menu consists of
  a single screen, where most of the space is taken up of a picture of a
  screaming man seemingly having his face torn apart. On the left part of
  the screen is a text display window, but the background sadly interferes
  a lot with the text; wouldn't it have been a better idea to at least have
  two different palettes for these? At the bottom left, below the display,
  are three gadgets; FILES, MUSIC and INFO. The music menu consists of
  three chiptunes (max 50k pp for submissions, it says). Overall, this pack
  gives me a good overall feel of solidity and niceness. Very good.

  Spread and released simultaneously at Saturne and Gravity.
  review: I have just experience the 'Moments' musicdisks - a rather hefty
  3.8 mb LHA file. So what do I think of it? I like some parts, others
  less. With skilled graphicians like Lazur and Danny working on this,
  there should certainly be no problems graphically! But why is the main
  selector screen so bland and uninspiring when it's wrapped in such
  graphical greatness? The four 'icons' at the bottom of the screen does
  not tell us much, so we're reduced to trying them out. I foolishly tried
  the one on the right first, and was immediately told 'good bye'. Just so
  you won't follow in my footsteps, the icons do the following (left to
  right): Show credits, play a cooperation tune, show an AMAZINGLY GREAT
  picture by Lazur - perhaps his best ever!! and exit the production.
    But enough about the graphics, what about the music in this musicdisk?
  Dreamer's the old-timer here, and Muffler's sort-of his protege. This
  means their music reminds me a little of each other... Still, Dreamer
  does not feel so bound by rules - sort of reminds me of Bruno - and
  Muffler's tunes always have that jazzy feel to them. These are two good
  composers, and this is - overall - a good musicdisk. Hedgehog's code is
  all it needs to be, but not much else. The bump mapping was nice, 'tho.
  Will work on a standard unexpanded A1200.

  Released for The Party 96 4k intro competition, unplaced.
  review: Now, this is something cool! It opens with a cool green swirling
  tunnel, which then after a short break starts to move and gets bumpmapped
  in new colors - white/blue! Then some plasma-like effect in green and
  purple and finally a red/white effect I can't really describe :) Very very
  nice. c2p and cruncher routines by Zero/Balance.

  5th in the Assembly 97 64k intro competition.
  review: A real nice little intro from Nah Kolor here, that scores lots on
  its colorfulness and the smooth finish to much of its effects. Though most
  of the 3d routines are in 2x2 resolution, it never really appears blocky,
  perhaps apart from the very last envmap object. After a long pause for
  precalculation, the intro opens with a pretty cool flashing twirling
  effect :), and continues with a rotzooming bumpmap routine which looks
  very cool and colorful! Next we travel into a morphing tunnel, with smooth
  finishing, which magically morphs into an envmapped face object! Next is a
  2x2 water ripple effect, an envmap object before the entire thing is
  concluded with a NAH KOLOR logo done by Fame back in 96 (as the signature
  tells us). You have to press LMB to exit the intro, and when I did it
  crashed my machine... oh well :) This is actually quite nice...

  review: This demo opens interestingly, with lots of bumpmap action and
  considerable style, so it's a bit of a disappointment when it crashes
  after 30 seconds! I tried a couple of times too, but no luck. It even says
  in the enclosed aminet text file that this is a fixed version too...go

  review: Not much of an effort this, a hastily thrown together intro
  composed of a blocky swirly dot tunnel, a rather cool credits part, and a
  Nah Kolor fullscreen logo. Not much to shout about.

  code: Ripper, gfx: Mag666, music: Raze (The Player 6.1A format).
  6th in The Party 99 40k intro competition.
  review: Radar-like display opens this intro, sweeping around the screen
  before dissolving into particles forming the word NAH KOLOR. Next is the
  logo and credits over a blue animated backgrund and some additional words.
  One nice thing about this intro is that it keeps a thumbnail of the action
  in the top right corner, nice design touch. Next is a small picture of a
  scary shark-like fish, which after a few moments have blue/white
  lightspheres overlaid. Next is more of that blue animated background with
  more words overlaid.... And then it ends. This intro at least goes for a
  wholesome design in blue and white, though it doesn't altogether succeed.
  A pretty middle-of-the-road intro.
    Please note that the version reviewed is the final version, released
  after the party. The intro uses Scout's c2p routine.

  Alvin, Teis/Spaceballs, Makke/Visuale.
  review: Certainly a nicely designed mag, Devotion screams style at you
  from the first instance you look at its panel. A very clean and readable
  font, and page design that looks a lot like - oh yes! - ROM - gives a
  professional impression. But as we all know, the most important thing in a
  diskmag is the quality of its articles. And this is a place where
  "Devotion" excels, we really have to say. I honestly believe I have not
  read a more interesting mag since "ROM", and if they continue to release
  issues like this, then we have a new #1 mag in the not-too-distant future.
  The best mag in ages.
    Not really sure about the release date, but it's after Mekka Symposium
  at least, since they feature a report from the party. My best guess is
  around may.

· Sign (1995, 21.05, 40k Intro).

  Released for the Nexus 95 40k intro competition.
  review: Opens with a nice NPL logo with a 3D starfield behind it.
  There are some reasonable advanced effects, like the very nice
  fire effect and a voxelspace terrain...but it's all too blocky to make
  any kind of impact. Sorry. Looking at the review of "The End" below, it
  seems like they've recycled most of the effects from this and used it in
  that intro!

· The End (1995, 28.12, AGA 40k Intro).
  code: THCM, gfx: Toxic/Abyss, music: Cyborg (The Player 6.1A format).
  review: This intro opens with a good logo with a starfield behind it
  (sound familiar at all?), but holds that effect just a little too long.
  I guess it's precalculating at this point, so it's partly excusable - I
  hate those 'please wait while precalculating' messages... At least we're
  getting an effect, a good graphic and some music! Next is a spacecutting
  routine, but the objects (spheres, it seems) are so blocky the routine is
  ruined. Next there's a rather good fire effect, followed by a blocky
  voxel landscape. This part is also, unfortunately, very blocky and has an
  unusual choice of palette. The whole thing is rounded off with a sort of
  chunky image stretcher/zoomer/thing, which starts with what seems like a
  map of the world... Then it all ends quite abruptly.
    Since no actual text appears anywhere in the intro, I depacked it and
  found some text describing the credits. The name is based on the
  filename. Also see my review of "Sign" above...

Nerve Axis was born in July 1992 by Telemach, and was originally head-
quartered around Bolton, Manchester in England. Later that year, in
september, several British groups split up, and Nerve Axis gained a lot
of good members. Their demo "Impossible Cube" (93) was the first British
AGA demo. Lots of members later left, forming the new group 'Neo'. Among
the ones who left were previous star coders Khul and Rombust. OSD left the
scene altogether. From an alltime high of 45 (!) members this left them
with 7. After some time without even a coder, things then started to pick
up. They recruited new members, and after Neo died Rombust rejoined.
  Today they're a whole new crew, and are way on their back to almost
singlehandedly reviving the British scene. Their first signs of real success
came when they unexpectedly WON the democompetition at The Assembly 97 with
their amazing demo "Pulse".
  1993 - Original founder Telemach left to concentrate on his new group
Ascii Unlimited mid 93. His organizing duties were taken over by Sarek and
Evil-C. Kenton left to form a new group mid 93. English coder Oedipus left
for Destiny shortly after the Destiny Communion party in august. English
coder Lando is no longer a member, but has resurfaced in Mangoo in the year
2000!
  1996 - Bliss left the group for Steps of Change in april. The first issue
of their diskmag "Pressure" [12/96] was released in december.
  1997 - The group travelled to finland for the Assembly party in august,
and brought with them a demo that's a very close contender for 'demo of the
year' 1997. "Pulse" [08/97] won the competition at this major party, and
established the group as a major force in the demo scene.
  1998 - In february the group released the promotional intro "Sentient Ore"
for Darkage's diskmag "Showtime #9". In a major cleanup, Ace (sysop '13TH
HOUR'), ZipZippy (eng sysop 'TRUCK OR TREAT II', 12/96-), Demolee (fin
raytrace sysop 'MOS EISLEY', doublememb Abuse, 08/97-), Turbo (eng sysop
'CYBERSPACE', 12/96-), Nik (code, 12/96-), Nexus (code, 12/96-) and Icon
(trade, 12/96-) were all kicked in april. August came with Assembly again,
and the group once more travelled to finland with a new demo. The result was
another success; "Relic" [08/97] won the demo competition for the second
year in a row.
  2001 - In an interview with group leader Crash in Haujobb's "Devotion #2"
[06/01] diskmag, the group's future was discussed. Most members now have
pcs, and the prospect of further amiga demos are almost nonevident. Their
coder Schlott now works as a pc coder for Runecraft in Yorkshire, England,
currently finishing up work on his first commercial title, the puzzle game
"Super Bubble Pop". Zone is also working at Runecraft, designing front
screens, menus and websites for various projects. Coder Venom has emigrated
to the usa to work for a large ISP, while finnish musician Ganja (ex Mystic,
old handle Slice, new late95, who left for Scoopex some time ago) is in the
finishing stages of cutting his first commercial cd. Meson has probably left
the scene for good, devoting his time to the woman he loves.

  code: Tommy Schlott, gfx: Zone, Meson, music: Azazel/TBL, "Rundfunk" by
  Ganja, editor: Meson.
  review: This new filemag actually does the unthinkable and changes the
  standard diskmag layout! This actually tries a different approach to
  presenting its articles than the standard RAW/ROM style! Does it work?
  Yes and no. It's always nice with originality, but I'm not sure when it
  comes to userfriendliness. Usually, when you pick up a mag, you instantly
  know how to control it since they are all pretty much the same. With
  Pressure, you migh feel initially a little confused, since almost nothing
  is as it usually is! Happily, however, the mag multitasks just fine,
  which means I can run it in the background - which makes writing these
  reviews a lot easier! :)
    Content-wise, however, it's not that impressive. It's quite obvious
  that all the truly talented editors are already writing for other
  magazines ;) Still, the whole mag reeks of a crew hungry for glory, so I
  won't write this off just yet...

  code: Schlott, gfx: Meson, music: "3 Minutes" by Ganja, "Aphrodesic" by
  Jam & Spoon (remix by Ganja). Winner of the Assembly 97 demo competition!
  review: If "Captured Dreams" is the king of 1997, then "Pulse" is
  certainly the handsome prince! From out of nowhere comes a gang of
  British sceners, lead on by a coder noone's really heard of before, and
  shows the finns at the Assembly what TOTAL DOMINATION looks like! There
  are HEAPS AND HEAPS of excellent, greatlooking, innovative effects, as
  well as two thumping techno soundtracks and graphics that are functional.
  You don't really mind that there's only one fullscreen picture, and that
  it's not particularly exciting, because there's so much else going on.
  The fact that there's no outstanding graphics and sound are more than
  made up for by the code. "Pulse" is almost 8 minutes (at least on my
  machine ;) of some of the most pure enjoyable demo material I've seen in
  ages. Thank you, Schlott - I can watch another two hundred boring BBS
  intros now =)
    If this is their idea of a demo made for 060 owners, then I guess I'll
  be able to live with my 030 for a while longer. You see, I encountered no
  problems whatsoever on my machine; not the slightest hint that it wasn't
  catching up. One of the top 3 demos of 1997, no doubt about it. The
  raytraced picture of the fish is "Catching Rays" by Meson, which came 4th
  in the raytrace competition at the same party.

· Sentient Ore (1998, .02, Intro).
  code: Babbage, gfx: Zone, music: "Bassbin Bangin'" by Ganja.
  review: Nerve Axis deliver a nice promotional intro for the Darkage
  diskmag "Showtime #9" here, and manages to maintain their position (in my
  eyes) as a top quality demo group. It seems Schlott is not their only
  coder of some quality. The intro opens with the words 'DARKAGE' and
  'SHOWTIME #9' bumpmapped, over which two moving light points travel
  around, lighting a couple of letters at a time. Then the music kicks in
  for real, and we're presented with some of this issues headlines. The
  music is a chapter onto itself, a weird and - at times - wonderful little
  piece of big beat ambient techno electronic wondrousness... Try saying
  that after 10 pints! Rather nice, oh yes.

  code: Schlott, gfx: Meson, Wade (picture), music: Ganja (The Player 6.1A
  format). Winner of the Assembly 98 demo competition!
  review: "Relic" doesn't update too frequently on my machine :) As
  predicted, it's a pretty processor-intense demo, though on fast Amigas it
  surely rocks! It tries to relate a story, but watching the demo that
  doesn't really matter...It's all just there to showcase the effects
  anyway! As mentioned, the graphics engine of this demo is heavy on the
  processor, but it is also very impressive. Given the complexity of the
  engine, the relative slowness can almost be forgiven. Having said that,
  it's not so slow it's unwatchable by any means!
    While the accompanying text file claims it requires 6MB fast, the system
  test it performs at the beginning claims it only requires 4MB.

     Cult, new 12/90), SwEinstein (Svein Berge, code, ex Cult, new 12/90).
???> Raider (ex Decept).

Mainly consisting of Norwegian members, Network was coorganizer of two
copy parties in Norway (1989 and 1990). Years later, another Network
was/is active, but this group has absolutely nothing to do with the
original ones, who probably sprang out from Network on the C64.

Daisy left.
Sphinx joined Violence.
Rick joined Flash Production.
Finnish Catman joined Dual Crew.
Norwegian Bug rejoined Razor 1911.
White Hot and Savage (both ex Wizzcat) were kicked.

  as a coder!
Norwegian Joker (ex Phobia) changed his handle to Corny and joined Vision.

Network made a name for themselves in 1997 by releasing their diskmag
"Trashcan", causing some renewed interest in the Spanish scene!
The end of the year saw them recruiting two new members from the old
Spanish group Goblins, who simultaneously joined Essence! When Darkus joined
from Digital in mid 1998, he took over editorship of "Trashcan".

  convincing, either. I can control my enthusiasm.

New Masters, The (TNM)
----------------------
GER> Tip (Armin Sander, code).

This legendary German group made many of the best utilities in the late
80's, with tools like the TNM-Cruncher being used by the entire scene. TIP
was also a member of The Prophets AG, but I am uncertain if that was prior
or after TNM... He also coded the Oktalyzer music program.

     Xtasy (Stig A. Olsen, code).
USA> Cyberbit (sysop 'LIGHT YEARS', down RAW3).
???> Challenger, Emo.

New Wave may not be a very wellknown name, but the fact remains that their
members have been quite important in the evolution of the scene. They were
the ones that cooperated with Pure Metal Coders on the release of the first
few issues of "R.A.W", for example. Their coder M.M. coded the first two
issues, and his code was also used for issue three! By that time, though,
M.M. had left for the army, and was unable to work any more with the code,
so from the fourth issue his code was replaced, and New Wave had nothing
more to do with the mag. They were declared dead late 1992.
  1992 - Norwegian coder Flesh joined Majic 12 around mid 92.

Bushman's board went down when he went to the army, around the same time
  that the group died.
Norwegian Chainsaw (new RAW2) joined LSD.
Pitcher (new RAW2) joined Noxious.
Lion (Trade, ex Goonies) joined Vision.
American sysop Master Copy ('DAWNS END') joined Awesome.

Logic (old handle Gadget, ex Palace, though some sources claim he came
  directly from Cytax) joined Noxious.
Norwegian Hunter rejoined No Limits.
Dr.M joined Celtic.

NL ïs a Norwegian demo group, started in September 1988 by Whirlwind and
Baltazar. I have seen one single crack from them. Their main achievement is
perhaps that they were very early, possibly the first, to code a vector bob
routine ("Vector-Bobs", 10/89).
  1990 - In april, they were seriously reinforced when most of the Norwegian
group Visual Arts joined plus musician Hattrick/Razor 1911 joined. They
supposedly opened a Norwegian elite board called 'CRIME ZONE' late in the
year. In october, they coarranged a successful party in Arendal with IMP
666.

North Star (NS)
---------------
SWE> Atom (05/89), Crab (code, 05/89), Dragon (sysop 'DRAGON'S LAIR', later

     editor, 88-05/89), Titan (music, later Uncle Tom/Scoopex),  Virus,
     Zymox (late89).

North Star was an exclusively Swedish demo group, perhaps best known for
their early diskmag "Exceller 8" and their two members Kaktus and Mahoney -
authors of the origina NoiseTracker and some truly wild musicdisks! =)
  Starfire coded a couple of antivirus bootblocks that acted in a way the
writers of the viruskillers didn't appreciate... They were therefore - to
this day, even - classified as viruses. There's little doubt that Starfire
never meant for this.
  1988 - The first issue of their pioneering diskmag Exceller 8 was released
in cooperation with Fairlight. Coder Celebrandil joined.
  1989 - Three more issues of Exceller 8 were released, one more with
Fairlight and finally two more with The Silents. They lost Celebrandil
(code) to Fairlight. Swedish musician Titan contributed music to the demo
"Big" by the Swedish division of Scoopex. He would later join Scoopex
himself, under the handle Uncle Tom.
  1990 - French section was formed around the middle of the year by members
of Brain Wave. They all finally left for Agile in 1991.

  review: Unfortunately this mag cannot be reviewed as of right now, since
  it quite simply refuses to work. No amount of reconfiguration of my system
  can get the blasted mag to boot properly, the best I could do was get the
  mag to boot and start playing some music, though with a completely green
  screen. :(

  review: The third issue of X8 is a very good example of an early amiga
  diskmag, with code certainly the superior of its rivals like Cracker
  Journal. There is a good amount of articles, though far from all are scene
  related - there's also a lot about games, movies and music. This is not
  really a criticism, since all mags were full of this kind of thing back
  then... Speaking of the code: X8 was almost certainly the first mag ever
  to feature clipart in the articles! Graphics are mostly good, with a
  special nod to the cool EXCELLER 8 logo in the editorial article. Article
  selection are done like in Crack Journal and Hack-Mag, with each page
  being assigned a number, and the reader just thumbing through them. This
  was their first issue in cooperation with The Silents, after two issues
  with Fairlight.
    This mag totally refused to work on my system, so I was finally forced
  to succumb to WinUAE to be able to read it! Sacrilege, I know... =) It
  worked satisfactorily under a KS 2.0 configuration.

No-Soul Produkktions (NSP, 1992-)
---------------------------------
GER> Barock (founder gfx, 92-early93), Bass (Patrick Lindsey, founder
     music, 92-early93), Foxx (founder music, 92-early93), Lynxx (founder
     code, 92-early93).

NSP started life as a subgroup of The Silents, only to leave them late 92
to be a group in their own right. Bass has released several music singles
under his real name, Patrick Lindsey, and at least one single under the
NoSoul name.

· Static Chaos (1992, late, ECS Trackmo).
  code: Lynxx, gfx: Barock, music: Bass, Foxx.
  review: Their first release, made while they were still a subgroup of The
  Silents. Check out the disk from DOS, it's got the main module on it!
  The music sounds like someone trying to do Jesper Kyd...badly!
· GLE tested A1200/030-50/2mb chip, 4mb fast/3.0.
                Note: The endpart has graphical errors, even after setting

Nova [france] (1990-)
---------------------
FRA> Arthy, Cygnus, Djiby (gfx, 08/93), DTS (early93), GFA (gfx), Gadin
     (early93), Hades (ex Devils), Ivory, Marc, Mr.Keel (Alexandre
     Kairouannais, swap, ex Devils, rescene later, 07/93-early95).
???> Header (ex Delight).

Nova was formed when Nova Inc. and Voyagers fusioned. They seem to be based
in France; it's where most of their members and their website are.
Nova france and Nova sweden are NOT the same group!

Odin and Header were kicked out. Odin joined Gods, and
French musician Bluesilence (ex Devils, early93) and swapper Clary left for
  a short visit in Eden before settling down in Next Generation Crew.
Coronal joined Analog.
Lex left for Orient.
French coder Poison (Emmanuel Marty, ex Devils, 08/93) got kicked. His
  further scene career is unknown.

  Freedom (1992, late, ECS Trackmo).

  Essential Oldies (1993, ECS Musicdisk).

  code: Powerbrain, gfx: UFO/Banana Projects, Lex, music: Freddy.
  Released at The Party 93.

  SOHO (1994 or pre, AGA, 3 disks).


Nova [Sweden]
-------------
SWE> Fazer (swap, ex Genetic, new mid93).

Nova sweden is NOT the same as Nova france!

Swedish musician Deelite joined Xentric.
Swedes Limbo (ex Genetic, new mid93) and PGL (ex Circle) joined Noxious.


Nova Inc.
---------
Nova Inc. and Voyagers fusioned into Nova.


Noxious (NXS)
-------------
SWE> Boshiken (swap), Cerize (Peter Hanning, code, ex Strange or Voice?, old
     handle Crayon), Clav (music), Core (Stefan Backman, sysop 'FINAL
     IMPACT' WHQ opened late92, ex Strange or Voice?, new late92-11/92),
     Knotis (code, 10/91-04/92), Reverend D (sysop 'TRESPASS', new
     early92-01/95), Udden (trade, early92), Zany (trade, ex Metallians).
???> Dr.Mirios (music, 12/92), Predator (gfx), Sudden (ex Spirit), Triton.

Noxious were a relatively solid, mostly Swedish demo and modem crew.
Their most famous act was probably the release of Crayon's ProTracker 2.1A
in april 1992, taking over the legacy after Amiga Freelancers. Many people
complained about the early versions however, saying how they were terribly
buggy and incompatible. Later versions remedied this, but the Noxious
ProTrackers never reached Amiga Freelancers' popularity.
  1992 - Kazer (sysop, ex LSD) stopped by briefly on his way to Defjam early
in the year.
1993 - Swedish graphician PGL (ex Nova) moved on to Illusion late 93.

Swedish WHQ and musician Dolphin (Anders Ramsay, 01/91-12/92) left the
  scene. Since Dolphin was the WHQ, where does this leave Noxious!?
  Dolphin reported in Propaganda #4 that the only remaining section was the
  inactive swedish one.
Swedish coder Mr.Taxfree (04/92) left the scene.
Swedish swapper Limbo (ex Nova) joined Razor 1911 new.
Deshay joined Shining 8.
Inferno (ex Spirit) joined Palace.
Swedish sysop Rabzi (sysop 'PROVOCATION') got kicked. In an earlier intro,
  they helped plug the then-independent board, so it's a fair assumption
  that Rabzi came from independence to Noxious.
Schizo (ex Supplex) joined Circle.
Swedish swapper Zanitor (04/92), Shortie and the Norwegian division got
  kicked.
German musician Dynamite (ex Analog, new mid 93) joined DCS.
Swedish coder and swapper Colorbird (ex Razor 1911 old, 92) joined Scoopex.
  While in Noxious, he published a pack called '800 DEGREES'. It is
  uncertain what happened to this after he left.
Germans Dark (swap pack 'NoPack') and Rebel MC (swap, both ex Desire) both
  joined Interpol. However, RAW #6 claims Dark joined the new Jetset for a
  while before moving on to TRSI...
Trader 24X left to join Energy.
German swapper Misery changed his handle to Skull and joined the new Jetset.
Devan joined Shining 8.
Raven (ex Rage) and Wild Thing got kicked out.
Portwer (sysop 'EQUIPOISE', 10/91), Logic (swap) and Bratz (10/91-04/92)
  joined Rebels.
Dutch swapper Cone (pack 'NOPACK', ex Spirit, 09/92) joined Gothic.
Boozo (sysop 'INTROSPECTIVE', ex Basstech) joined Submission.
Floyd (sysop 'BEYOND REALITY'), Hurricane, Pitcher (ex New Wave) and Xstaz
  (sysop 'ICE PALACE', ex Alpha Flight) all joined Legend. Xstaz did NOT
  join from Spirit as stated in EuroChart 15 and 16, he stopped by AFL first
  :)
Swedish swapper Logic (ex New Wave) gave the "NoPack" pack to Hurricane when
  he left. Later Hurricane also left, and passed it on to the Dutch Cone.
  When Cone left for Gothic, I guess Dark took over...
Winger (ex Pirates) was kicked, and therefore joined Alpha Flight with
  Punisher.
Swedish sysops Bugs Bunny ('POLE POSITION', ex Drakpak, 10/91) and Rogue
  ('GATES OF IMPRECATION', boardname 'OUTLAW TOWN' 10/91, old handle
  Whistler) were both kicked).
Kevin Key (sysop 'INSIDE TREATMENT', ex Fusion) joined The Silents.

· Bontro (ECS Intro).
  code: Knotis, gfx: Predator (logo), Dolphin (fonts), music: Dolphin.
  review: This one features a 'classic' design, but with a few twists.
  What appears to be a VERY standard intro with a logo at the top and a
  sinusscroller, soon proves to be a little more imaginative than that.
  There's also a textplotter (for boardnumbers), and some imaginative use
  of the sinescroller in the background while board adverts are plotted.
  The tune's a pretty bland affair, to be frank. I'm not sure about any
  release date, but based on the credits and the boards (OUTLAW TOWN later
  changed its name) it's probably from the same time period as the NOG IS
  NOT ENOUGH! intro.

· Nog Is Not Enough! (1991, 28.10, ECS Intro).
  code: Knotis, gfx: Bratz, music: "Huga!" by Dolphin.
  review: A fair little intro, made at an internal meeting just to show
  their board numbers and contact adress. There's a million of these, and
  this is about average. Nothing irritates, little excites.
  This intro has the most amazing compatability problem I've ever seen!
  I first tried just running it, and it ran fine but a little too fast.
  It was damned hard to read the text since it was plotted so fast! So I
  tried KillAGA, and - wait for this - it ran BUT WITH SERIOUS GRAPHICS
  GLITCHES! Weeeird...

  Light party (Sweden) and at The Gathering (Norway).
  review: This is the intro supplied on the disk with the release of
  ProTracker 2.1A. As I remember, you didn't have to rip the great tune,
  because it was included on the disk as an example module. "Dekkadance" is
  certainly the best tune Dolphin ever made! The intro itself is nicely
  designed, and fits beatifully with the tune.

· Propaganda Intro (1992, .12, ECS File).
  code: Colorbird, gfx: none, music: "Exile" by Elmer/Supplex.
  review: A rather boring intro with only one effect (a bouncing jellyball)
  and a text plotter (ugly font!) announcing the upcoming release of a new
  papermag for the scene called Propaganda. Ofcourse, Colorbird's plans
  never gave fruit, and the papermag project was later cancelled without a
  single issue being released. Instead, it was later born as a diskmag
  (with Colorbird as editor) in Circle. Four issues were released for
  Circle and the new Razor 1911 before the mag was abandoned totally.
    The release date I've concluded with is a result of the tune being made
  in october 92, and the first issue being scheduled for march 93.
  Therefore this intro had to be released some time inbetween the two, and
  what better opportunity than The Party in december 92?

Nuance (NCE, http://nuance.home.pages.de)
-----------------------------------------
GER> Andy (Andreas Dubouis, music, re, 12/97), Big-Rat (Kai Hoepner, org
     edit "X-Files", 10/97-02/98), Evrimsson (Evrim Sen, music, 10/97-
     04/98), Madstop (code, 01/98), Phlexible (writer, 10/97), Raven (Harald
     Wittmaack, founder mainorg gfx, 01/97-02/98), Sunny (Sonja Felber, edit

     (10/97), Odin (gfx, 10/97).

People below this line are NOT members of the group any longer, despite that
we do not know when they left the group. We sometimes have to separate like
this to get a clearer overview of a group. The break here is from a
memberlist in the "Wild Announcement Intro" [10/97].

GER> Abstract (gfx, 08/93), Frenchy, Gfx-Twins (gfx), Iceboy, Jackal (code,
     08/93), Lomex, Overdog (ex Delight), Painkiller, Professor (code,
     08/93), Savage, Thor (Juergen Kopfmueller, swap, 93), Wusel (code, ex
     Style, new late96).
ENG> Quark (music swap, old handle James, 93).
???> Mythos (music, 08/93).

Raven was one of the original founders of Nuance, back in the early 90's,
and says in an interview in Insomnia #2 that he will stay in the group
until he dies! The group has some rules which must be followed; no double
memberships and never more than 15 members. The now publish a scene mag
called 'Wild', the news mag 'X-Files' and the chippack 'Trilobyte' on a
regular basis! And by the way, German editor Sunny is a GIRL :)
  German musician Andy (originally ex Damian, new late 93) once left for
Essence, and then left the Amiga scene altogether, to concentrate on his
PC demo scene activities. However, in late 1997 he returned to the Amiga
scene in his old group, Nuance!
  1993 - MAD left before he was kicked mid 93.
  1996 - German coder Shaken was kicked out due to inactiveness 04/96.
  1997 - They announced their upcoming diskmag "Wild" with the "Wild
Announcement Intro" [10/97], and also released "X-Files #19" [10/97] that
month. Germans Kill'o'Byte (code, 10/97) and X-Poole (Marco Willemsen, org
music, ex Bonzai, new late93-10/97) were removed from the memberlist,
probably sometime between 10/97 and 01/98. December saw the release of "X-
Files #20" [12/97].
  1998 - Swedish coder HBE (ex HBS [no entry], 10-12/97) left the scene
early 1998, after releasing a less than great intro at The Party 7. This
left Grace as the single remainding coder. English member Darkus, doublememb
from Digital (old handle Nemes!s, early98), is no longer a member, as of mid
98. He is now in Network and Rebels.

Wellknown Belgian swapper Flynn left.
English musician Mindshadow changed his handle to Jozz and joined Defekt.
English section was kicked. The dudes below?
Andy (ger music, 12/93) and Michael (eng music, 08/93) were both kicked,
  and consequently both joined Delite. For more info on Andy, read the
  history section above.
Xentec joined Addicts.

  review: After a too bright opening Nuance logo and some really lame
  afterburned gouraud (i believe) wectors, we are taken to the mainpart...
  (please take note that by this time the incredibly intense music will be
  well and truly on your nerves!) Here we're shown an upscroller explaining
  the upcoming Nuance mag "Wild". This part is ok, all done in shades of
  brown. The upscroller can be paused with the rmb, for easier reading. They
  outline some of the most important articles they've got lined up for the
  first issue (though we'd like to put a small question mark in front of the
  'articles from the toilet' thing there guys...), as well as the credits
  for the entire first issue! Editors will be Kalikone and Raven, code by
  Kill O Byte, graphics by Raven and modules by Merlin M! and
  Deelite/Balance. Press the left mousebutton and you're shown the credits
  again briefly, nicely done. Not the most interesting 'announcetro' in the

  Released for The Party 97, but not shown.
  review: This intro shows every sign of people who have not been paying
  much attention to the evolution of the demo scene. The intro's main fault
  lies in its choice of a (2x2?) blocky approach to the routines it presents
  - even the bitmap tunnel! There's a phong object here, but it's small,
  greyscale and blocky too. It doesn't seem like this kind of intro is
  really your thing, Nuance - why don't you try something a little
  different next time? This looks like it's from 1993 or 94.

  review: This issue opens with a picture of a little girl clutching her
  teddy bear. It's a good picture, but nothing terribly exciting. As we
  enter the mag, I immediately notice the old design is still there. It's
  REALLY time to remove that Ethic logo now, don't you think, guys?
  A much needed cleanup of the groups, reducing the amount to almost half
  of what was previously included, helps a lot on the readability of the
  mag. Still, there's no hiding that this is just plain old X-Files, still.
  Personally, I'm waiting for the new design.
    The module was later released separately to aminet by Oops! themselves.

  picture of Raven's usual good quality, before continuing into the only
  real part of the intro. This part consists of a goodlooking, slowly
  twisting tunnel in the background and a text plotter on top. Nicely
