     PP (code, 08/95), Scorpio (code, 12/92).

Union was formed by members of the groups Deform, Action Direct and
Katharsis. A very fitting name for a union of three groups...
Their main claim to fame must surely be their amazing coder Musashi, who
undoubtedly was Poland's #1 coder. Also, Hali is the author of the music
utility program MOD2SAMP. They are also the long standing arrangers of the
Intel Outside parties in Poland.

Poles Animal (gfx, 93), Katani, Tom (code, 93), Python (gfx, 93), Pluto,
  Seq and XTD (music, 12/92-93) all joined TRSI late 93 or early 94.
  Another source said Katani and XTD joined Mystic...
Polish graphician Lazur joined TPDL.
Redman (old handle Iceman) joined Mad Elks.
Musician Snoopy (08/93-08/95) joined Energy (PRP4). Snoopy delivered music

· Rotate Mania (1995, 30.08, ECS 64k Intro).
  code: PP, gfx: Pic, music: Snoopy.
  Released for the Intel Outside 95 64k intro competition.
  review: Not a bad little intro, though perhaps not quite good enough to
  reach the very top of the competition. There are some very good routines,
  like the impressive voxel terrain and the fullscreen HAM zoom rotator.
  The music is nice too, with a very distinct c64 flavour to it. Not bad at
  all, is my conclusion :)
    If you run the demo with the parameter '?', like 'Rotate.exe ?' you'll
  be presented with a number of options, like running without sound,
  showing some messages and playing the hidden game. The game is a kind of
  simple airhockey variation.

  Braincell (1995, 30.08, Demo).
  2nd in the Intel Outside 95 demo competition.

· Tear Down The Wall (1995, 30.08, AGA File).
  code/gfx: Musashi, music: Roberts.
  Winner of the Intel Outside 95 demo competition!
  review: Heavily based on Pink Floyd's "The Wall" music and film, that is
  what the first part of this Musashi tour-de-force occupies itself with.
  Using demo effects, it recreates several moments from the film, while a
  sampled rendition of the music plays in the background. Or tries to play,
  since my machine (030-50) wasn't fast enough! As a result, it jerked and
  played the music in jerks and spurts. I was much relieved when the second
  part started, with NORMAL protracked music...It made the routines a whole
  lot more enjoyable to watch :)
    The second part is what I'd describe as the demo part of the show.
  Here's where Musashi gets to do the usual phongs, bumps, zooms,
  spacecuts and even a rather wild little doom without sticking to any
  specific theme. In my opinion, this is the best part of the demo.
  I felt that the theme of the first part was a little limiting for some of
  his routines, making him unable to show their true potential. Here he can.
  One major drawback about the entire demo, however, must surely the ever-
  present shading. This is not the usual right-left pixel or every other
  pixel is black kind, however. It seems a little more flexible and
  variable, but is still quite annoying. I understand that it requires
  less raster time, but that doesn't mean I have to like it ;) Musashi must
  have used some kind of amazing internal compression to squeeze all this
  into one single 867k file - I'd expect the sampled music alone to take
  that much!! To conclude: Wow! Obviously requires some fast.

Unique (1989-1990)
------------------
FIN> Savage (10/89-02/90).

Unique was formed in july 1989. Soon after three members (Cool J, Santuu and
Equalizer) joined from Accession. Cool J was a couple of weeks in D-Mob
finland in 06/90, but returned again. Then, Exodus, Unique and some members
of Complex and Gate formed a new group called Image 06/90.

Universal Soldiers (US, 1994-)

     (gfx, 12/94).
SER> Haralampia (code, ex Enemy, new ROM3).
???> 1702 (12/94).

US was formed by the two frenchmen Schmoovy Schmoov/Complex (code) and
Monty/Paradox (music) in late 1994. Suny had just joined Bomb!, and his
picture in "Unsatisfied" clearly has a Bomb behind the name Suny, just like
he used in all his other pictures for Bomb!
  Lord, the Hungarian sysop of 'NUMBER OF THE BEAST' was a doublemember
(also in Absolute!) for a while.

German swapper Rahiem left for Essence (ROM4).
German graphics duo Gfx-Twins (12/94) left to join Essence (ROM3).

  Yul Brynner Was a Skinhead (Demo).
  code: n/a, gfx: n/a, music: "Acmedia" by Reflex/Movement.

· Unsatisfied (1994, 28.12, 40k Intro).
  code: Schmoovy Schmoov, gfx: Suny, music: Monty.
  8th in The Party 4 40k intro competition.
  review: A few nice effects (mainly vectorbased), a nice little chiptune
  and a picture of a cute dog with a red cross over it by Suny. That's what
  this intro offers; nothing extraordinary, but very very nice and cosy.

Boards; HOLY TOWER (ger, 11/90).

The Untouchables were formed in 1988 near Bremen, Germany. They have
existed a long while without being well known due to the fact that they
concentrate more on trading and swapping than releasing anything.


Upfront
-------
DEN> Einstein (code), Jozz (Johannes Bjerregaard, music), Yobbo (sysop 'THE
     LARCH').
???> Beatbuster (ex Direct), Spacebrain (music, 12/92).

Upfront is a Danish group, born as an extension of the already existing C64
one, when their coder Einstein started making demos on the Amiga.

Up Rough Soundsystem (1998-, http://www.uprough.com)
----------------------------------------------------
???> Blade (code music, 04/01), Booger (code, 04/01), Case (trade, 04/01),
     Elusive (music, 04/01), Idol (gfx, 04/01), Mortimer (gfx music, 04/01),
     Plus8 (raytrac network, 10/98-04/01), Qwan (music, 05/99-04/01), Skope
     (gfx music, 10/98- 04/01), Spot (gfx music, 04/01), Teis (music,
     04/01), Zaner (siteop, 04/01).

Up Rough appears to be mainly a music label, and it seems their first
products were released around 1998 - at parties like Icing 98 and
Compusphere X, indicating this is a Swedish group. They've even released
things such as samplepacks etc. =]
  1999 - Their first real coded production was released at Icing 99. The
intro, called "Introducin" [05/99], came fifth and last in the competition,
and was coded by Blueberry/Efreet.

  Introducin (1999, 16.05, Intro).
  producers: Blueberry/Efreet, Skope, Spot.
  5th in the Icing 99 intro competition.

  Ink (Intro).
  producers: Booger, Model, Mortimer Twang, Skope, Spot.

· April In Paris (2001, 15.04, Demo).
  code: Booger, Model, gfx: Spot, Plus8 (3d), music: Skope.
  9th in the Mekka Symposium 2001 demo competition.
  review: Well, this functions more as a 'music video' for the hip-hop/jazz
  soundtrack than as a demo. The visuals are all related to the music, and
  there are more images than effects. I am generally bored by these kinds of
  productions, but some people might find this interesting I guess. Up Rough
  is a music group, and music is what they do best, so it shouldn't really
  surprise anyone that music is what this release is all about. The 'Up
  Rough Success Index' was a fun idea, tho'! =]
