Guess Design seems to be an ascii subgroup, considering the fact that it
consists entirely of 2KAD members, and the intro for one of their
collections bore the heading 2000 AD. Members are: Warlock, Toms, Zero and
Elmore, according to the intro.
  Ozzy at one time, in mid to late 92, had Denmarks largest phonebill:
43,000 DKK!
  1992 - Danish sysop Energy ('NONSTOP UP'N'DOWN'), who had joined from Cult
in the middle of the year, was kicked late due to hacking on some of their
other boards! I have information that he was a member again in april of
1995... is this right?

Infinity joined Crime Devils.
Austrian sysop Imagic ('FIRE AND ICE') joined Sceptic.
Swiss sysop Spider ('DREAM PARK') joined from Legend (new RAW4), but didn't
  stay long. He joined Crack Inc., who died, and was then asked to rejoin
  Legend at The Party 2.

  "Mini Demo" demos.

  Back in Bizness (1990, ECS File).
  code: Droid, gfx: Blitz, Droid, music: Odkin.
  review: 2000 AD's very first demo!

· Ascii/Ansi Collection #01 by War/Guess (ECS File).
  code/gfx: Warlock, Music: unknown.
  review: An intro for the actual collection, it seems. Still, I found it
  alone on a board, and so I'm reviewing it as an intro in its own right.
  It's very blue. Blue and white. Actually, it's just a textwriter with a
  SMALL font. Not very interesting at all... What IS intersting, though
  (considering I also edit AIR - check it out!) is the music format.
  I could not rip it with any of my rippers, indicating a new/nonstandard
  format. Hmm...
