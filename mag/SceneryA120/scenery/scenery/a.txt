Abakus (1990-)
--------------
NOR> Comico (founder, ex Theatre, new late90).

Abakus was formed by Comico/ex Theatre and Circus of Power (group) late 90.
At least two small demos were released; "Unseen" and "Scheisse".


Abandon
-------
GER> Lucifer (trade, 01/91), Sigma Seven (sysop 'LAST RESORT', 04/92).
???> Crap (code), Pothead (ex Anthrox).

Abandon is a German group, initially active on the demo scene, but also
responsible for a crack or two...

  For Your Entertainment (1989, ECS File).

  Potheads Beast (1989, .12, ECS File).
  Released at the Vision/Avenger/DDC NewYear-Party Rotterdam.

  Megademo (1989, .12, ECS Megademo).

  E.J.I.D. (ecs intro).

· Crackintro (ecs intro).
  code: n/a, gfx: The Sarge/Fairlight (logo), music: Megawatt and The Sound
  Legend.
  review: This cracktro sports a nice logo by The Sarge, as its main asset.
  Apart from that it's not really anything special, just an OK intro, with
  just text and design elements taking up the rest of the screen. Get it for
  the cool logo :) There is no indication as to when it was released.
    The intro does not exit properly, just leaves you with a black screen
  and the need for CTRL-A-A... The intro reviewed was for the 100% fixed
  Quartex version of Kick Off 2 - Return to Europe.

Abnormal [old] (ABN)
--------------------
NOR> Andy (code gfx, later Absence, 90), Blackie Lawless, Eclipse (music,
     90), Highlander, Hugo (music, 90), Izzy (gfx, 90), Monzo (code, 90).

Abnormal was originally a Norwegian C64 demo crew, but since several of
their members later emigrated to the Amiga platform a section was created.
It's highly unlikely that the old Abnormal has anything to do with the new.

--------------------
N-L> Dada (music, 12/94), Earthshaker (Michel Bojawal, music, 12/94),
     Househakker (12/94), Rotox (Rene v.d. Steen, swap).

It is highly unlikely that the old Abnormal has anything to do with this
group.


Abnormalia
----------
ITA> Macno (Alessandro Franchetti, editor, 12/92-95).

Abnormalia is the group dedicated to releasing Abnormalia diskmagazine.
It was Italian writer Macno's new group after leaving Grace and 'Scene
Lyrics'. While writing for his own mag, he is also one of the busiest
contributors to several other leading mags, including having his own
sections (ABNOminio) in RAW8 and ROM4.

  Abnormalia issue #1 (1992, .12, ECS Diskmag).
  editor: Macno.

Absence (-1991)
---------------
NOR> Champ, Dma, EC Man (music), Zapper.

Absence was one of the leading demo groups in Norway around 90 and 91.
When the group died, Quest (04/91), Andy (04/91), Monzo, Mr. Man (04/91),
MCS, HeadX and Wizax (03/91) joined Andromeda. Timewalker joined Dual Crew.
  They were reborn almost right away, as a swapper group with Goofy (Henrik
Lie-Nielsen, 03/91) as the only member, but never released a real production
again. Other small productions they made, are a.o. "Ball Scroll" intro, "Bob
Plop" intro and "4 Round Color Equalizers" intro.

Norwegian swapper Rob (new 03/91) joined Dexion.

  Meltdown (late 90/early 91, ECS File).
  code: Poltergeist/XLNS, gfx: Quest, music: Mr. Man.
  Cooperation with Excellence (XLNS).

  Reform Pack Intro (1991?, ECS Intro).
  code: Andy, gfx: n/a, music: EC Man.
  info: Probably used for earlier issues too.

· Reform Pack Intro #26 (1991, 11.03, ECS Intro).
  code: Wizax, gfx: Goofy (font), music: Maestro/Kefrens.
  review: This intro is really very simple; there's just a font plotter,
  some moving colors in two lines (top and bottom) and some copper fades in
  the letters to achieve a better look. This was a popular design concept
  around these times. Goofy's 1 bitplane font, the only graphics, is quite
  OK, actually; I also like Maestro's music. Nothing special, but these
  oldschool intros tend to bring a smile to my face nonetheless :)
    This intro was probably used from this issue on, since it says 'Finally
  a new intro!' The intro also announces the joining of Rob. The pack is
  maintained by Zapper, Goofy and Quest.

----------------------
HUN> ADT (code music trade sysop 'LOCAL GRAVEYARD', doublememb Royal
     early96, ex Soc.Brigade, 08/92-early96), B2 Man (ex Live Act), Crm
     (code gfx, 08/92-04/94), Edge (code, 93-04/94), Ern0 (music codePC),

Absolute! was formed in late 1992 by the best members of Soc.Brigade (ADT,
Ben...) and Live Act (Asti, Viti...). They're probably best known for their
hungarian graphician Rack and their diskmag 'Sledge Hammer'. There was
actually 9 issues of the mag released in Hungarian before the first English
release! After the last issue of SH had been released, there were some
rumours and loose advertising for a new cooperation mag with Dreamdealers,
called "Cult". Fester would be main editor, and Napoleon from Dreamdealers
would do the code. They also arranged the Hungarian party The Hammering in
1993 and 1994, and tried to coarrange Wildstock '95 with a pc group, but
that party was cancelled. Rack has NEVER been a doublemember of Balance, as
claimed in some mags. A mag released late 95 carried news that Lord and
Fester were now main organizers. Who were before?
  Other small productions ABS has released include "Vector Dreamz" (file),
"Utah Saints Fan Club" (AGA demo), "Party IV Report" and "Cult Special
Partyedit" (2disk AGA diskmag).
  1993 - They kicked all their foreign divisions, and are now 100% Hungarian
late 93.
  1994 - After travelling all the way to Finland for the assembly with
members of Sanity from Germany, Lord released the 'slideshow' "Assembly 94
Slideshow" [08/94] soon after.
  1995 - Graphician Skowron joined Funzine late 95. 'PALACE' BBS is not an
HQ anymore (late95).
  1996 - Polish Musician Scorpik (new late 95) left the Amiga scene for
Pulse on the PC in late 1996. Pulse, incidentally, features many talented
ex- and current Amiga scene celebrities, like f.ex. Lazur. Anyone with a
Pentium gathering dust would be well advised to check out their productions.
You might see a name or two you recognize :)
  1997 - Early in the year, Jean returned from his studies in France and
returned to his native Budapest. Mr.Now is not a member, as was stated in a
a diskmag. Poko and Fate joined with their board 'FATAL CONNEXTION'.

In Hungary, swappers Archibald (Bela Nadas Jr.) and Ben (founder, ex Soc.
  Brigade), coders Asti (08/92) and Viti (ex Live Act), musician T-Bozz
  (04/94) and graphicians Hamlet (ex Alcatraz, old handle Jaby, 93) and
  Hazel (old handle Mace) were kicked out due to communication problems.
Hawk was kicked.
German swapper and trader Star (Sascha Hoeppner) joined from Elysion 93, but
  got kicked and left the scene soon after.
Rackler, Twilight and Doc. Holiday (all ex Wildfire, new early93), Rodney
  (gfx, ex E.M.I, 93), Twice (code) and DSN (gfx, both new 93) all joined
  Lego.

  review: Oh yeah! This must certainly be one of the best-designed demos
  ever! It almost seems like they've considered the position of every
  single pixel in the whole demo! The Hungarian graphics genious Rack
  delivers some of his best graphics EVER, and even manages to beat his
  own amazing 'Ray of Hope 2' font with an AMAZINGLY colorful one! I'm
  putting it up for 'font of the year' :) And I haven't even BEGUN
  mentioning the music yet! Guess what? It's an amazingly cool tune!
  It kicks in with a groove and a danceability seldom heard. AMAZING!
    The animation of the race car crashing is from the movie 'Freejack'.

  review: This small crackintro (or so they claim...) is more a piece of
  weird design than a genuine Absolute production, but nevertheless... :)
  It seems like a small friendship production, done just to release
  something for the scene. There is no real stunning artwork here, and the
  whole thing seems pretty quickly thrown together. They mention they are
  all busy writing games, and have just squeezed this little prod in between
  their other projects. They mention that "Cream" will be released at The
  Party 93...guess it got delayed a little, eh? ;)

  all, better music, this could have been something really special. The way

  shareware picture shower, and the jpg pictures themselves in a separate
  directory. The pictures are slightly funny, though - there are 18 of them,
  some showing real scene legends like Slayer/Scoopex and Cougar/Sanity!
  About half are from the actual event, while the rest centers around the
  trip, mostly together with members of Sanity.

  review: Now this is more of an original intro! It features a spinning dot-
  ball in a small window in thr top right corner, a textplotter in the
  bottom left corner, and otherwise an Abuse ascii logo over that. The two
  windows are black with white text/dots, while the rest of the screen is in
  blue. Nicely different.
    Though it is not mentioned in the intro, Ganja was almost certainly a
  doublemember of Nerve Axis at the time. The version reviewed is from  the

  review: Another simple intro, with just a an abuse logo/picture, and a
  text plotter overlaid on it. The pic is OK, but nothing stunning. This
  intro requires AGA, though I can't for the life of me see why. The release
  date and name is based on the version string within the intro itself. The
  version reviewed is for the crack of Spherical Worlds AGA/ECS CD-Rip

Abyss was formed late 1992 by the best members of Arise (dragonfly, lou van

shortly after, in the beginning of 1993. In 1994, the entire group Pyrodex
joined. Pink was one of them.
  Dexter is the author of the amazing The Highest eXperience (THX,
http://thx.home.ml.org) music system for c64-like chip tunes, and Pink is
the author of some of the best tunes for it :)
  Other small productions Abyss has released are a.o. "Delirial
Desorientation" (packmenu intro), "BBS Intro", "Goagab" (intro, rel some
weeks before the Party 3), "S.M.U.D.O" (demo), "Music for the Lost" (2 disk

  1992 - Protektor and Cardinal, sysops 'WORLD DOWN FALL', both joined
Crystal in september.
  1993 - Mr.Night was kicked due to lameness (mid93). Zeroflag (code, new

  1995 - Qwerty sold his Amiga and left the scene late95.
  1996 - German swapper Sting (Dirk Dallmann, ex Bonzai Brothers, new

Meland (ex Spaceballs, new 04/96) was kicked in october. Also Jumping Pixel
(gfx, new early93-) and Luka (Gregory Engelhardt, gfx music, old handle
Mem'o'Ree, 05/94-) were both kicked due to inactivity in october.
  1997 - It is a little unclear what happened to the membership of german
graphician JCS (ex Scoopex, doublememb Syndrome, new 10/96-12/96), but he
was in both Sector 7, Syndrome and Abyss in april - and not a member later
in the year. Swedish multitalent (code^gfx^music^sysop!) Newt (ex Crux and
Subspace, new 10/96) decided to leave the scene to concentrate on his career
as an in-line skater around 09/97.
  1998 - In december, at The Party, German coder Dexter (Martin Wodok,
08/94-) released his last ever amiga production, the third-placed 40k intro
"Cruisin II - Cruise In" [12/98]. Dexter was one of the original members of
the group, and participated in most of its best productions. His leaving is
certainly a major blow to the group, and he will be sorely missed as a true
amiga scene devotee to the end.

Big-Rat and Madstop, the "X-Files" team which doublejoined from Ethic (in
  early 97) have now left Abyss, and are now only members of Ethic again.
German graphician and musician Toxic (Sven Dedek, ex Beyond, early93-08/95)
  left Abyss for his musical career. There were rumors that he was back on
  the scene in the middle of 1996, but these proved to be untrue.
  The Jungle #7 reported that he was a Rebels doublemember in 1994.
German musician and sysop Neurodancer ('AMBUSH', new early93-08/94), left
  due to internal affairs. As a consequence, 'ULTRAWORLD' is now the WHQ
  BBS (04/96). Later Neurodancer joined Looker House (06/96). Neurodancer
  made music for the demo "Drugstore" while in Abyss.
German swapper and packmaker Skindiver (Andreas Schwarz, new early 93-
  01/94) decided to leave the scene. He was, however, listed as 'editor' in
  the memberlist in "EuroChart #30" [07/97]!

  x 4ch ProTracker format). 16th in The Party 94 demo competition.
  review: The competition at TP94 was stiff, but I still think this
  deserved better than 16th. It's got nice design, good graphics, a nice
  unoffensive synth-poppie tune that's timed perfectly to some of the
  effects... It's not even boring! Tyshdomos' picture "Raped" that appears
  during the Jacko-part, was also entered in the graphics competition at
  The Party, where it came in at a split 10th place. All effects look VERY
  smooth and nice on my 030-50...but I suppose that's only natural when it
  was designed with an 020-14 in mind.
    The demo is split up into two parts, really, separated in the two files.
  The first part is the 'demo' part, while in the second one they poke fun
  at three other wellknown productions. It opens with a digitized animation
  of Pink going to buy a magazine at a big store (Virtual Dreams "242),
  before it's revealed that the magazine is all about Beverly Hills 90210,
  and we're played a rendition of the theme (Melon Dezign "Romantic").
  Then we're shown the credits in a screen design that's very similar to
  the one Sanity employed in SEVERAL of their productions...
    Though originally designed to run from floppy, hard disk installation
  is painless; just copy the two files where you want them and run.
  Couldn't possibly be easier :) Works fine on standard A1200.

  review: The opening is certainly the best part of this demo, with the
  raytraced animation by Pink and the fast texturemapped tunnel ride the
  definitive highlights of the demo. There's a hefty portion of BLOCKY
  goraud shading here that's more embarassing than anything else.
    Pink's music is sometimes good, sometimes average, and there's a couple
  of reasonable fullscreen pictures by Toxic in there. If you check out the
  demo's WorkBench icons, that's one of them in a miniature. Not too bad...
  but I'm not too fond of routines that look THIS blocky! HA will work on
  any AGA Amiga with 2mb chipmem. The end module is "Global Confusion II",
  the module Pink competed with at Doom's Day 94!

  Review: This is a very good intro. The thumping music, the good effects,
  the design... Most importantly, it does not fall into the 'advanced but
  boring' trend that has plagued intros ever since Pygmy Projects'
  "G-Force". There are some good effects here, most of which I'd guess were
  real crowd-pleasers at The Party...unfortunately, I haven't fed the
  results into Scenery yet, so I don't quite know ;) There's some text in
  the intro file, presumably an error code, that says 'buy AGA or run
  SetPatch!', which has me hesitant if this an AGA or ECS intro...
  Therefore, I have refrained from categorizing it.
  Should work on unexpaned A1200's.

  usual, is first rate. There are 5 tunes here, all conversions of tunes
  done originally for the C64. Coolness doesn't even get close.

  review: The first thing that struck me when I saw the opening of this
  demo was "Arte"! The opening bars of the music, as well as the graphical
  design, leave no doubt that this is indeed a homage to Sanity's classic.
  So, is the demo any good? It's a killer! Though it has excellent,
  advanced routines, it never forgets its true nature as an entertainment
  item. The design, the music, and the weaving together of the demo all
  indicate truly experienced demolitioners. Highly recommended.
  Recommends 030-50 or 040-25.

  review: Abyss' first original THX musicdisk is a goodie. You sort of know
  you're in for something good when the intro picture is a manipulated
  version of the Skate or Die title from the C64... There's some truly
  tasty THX tunes in here, and it's a real coup to have Geir Tjelta do a
  tune. For those of you who did not own a C64 and are therefore ignorant,
  young Mr.Tjelta was an OUTSTANDING C64 musician in his time. His
  greetings list here should be some indication! Strangely, there's no
  graphics credit even though they're certainly nothing to be ashamed of...
    Some text found in the intro strongly indicates a hidden game, but I
  haven't been able to find it yet.

· Klub Diznee II - Competition is Gone (1997, .02, AGA Musicfile).
  code: Pink, gfx: Cyclone, music: various (too many to mention).
  review: I didn't honestly believe they could do it, but they've gone and
  done it anyway! They've outdone themselves and easily topped the first
  KD! There's a brand new code, this time by Pink, that's even better than
  the original one, and this time there's a whopping 16 THX tunes for your
  enjoyment, from as many different composers. This means there's more
  variety here than in the original. The graphics are acceptable, being a
  combination of cartoony stuff with an unusual palette and a graffitti
  style. This is pure coolness, so go download it and become a THX addict!
    The tunes in this musicpack are all from the first THX IRC competition,
  held in early 1997. Pink was the winner, followed by Geir Tjelta.

  code^music: Pink, gfx: Cyclone.
  review: Yes! Another winner by a crew that never ceases to amaze me!
  This small (130k) intro manages to evoke some feelings in an old scener's
  heart... 'remember when there was no c2p?' The special brand of Abyss
  nostalgia - remembering the good times without cloning yourself - seems
  amazingly fresh. Remember that these guys were the people that brought
  SID-quality tunes to the Amiga in the shape of THX! The tune here,
  however, is a more synthpoppy, funky affair. This was NOT released at
  any party, since they're trying to get back to the old times feel.
  Just excellent, right down to the 'partners in crime' text on their
  greetings, making us remember a thousand great cracktros over the years.

  in demo/aga on AmiNet, so...

· Kindergarden '97 Invitation (1997, early to mid, File).
  code^gfx^music: Pink (music in THX format).
  Invitation to the Kindergarden '97 party.
  review: One-man demo-making crew Pink does this invitation intro for a
  small Norwegian Amiga-only party! The intro is nice enough, with a small
  title screen with a fish jumping across it, followed by the presentation
  of the invitation text itself. This seems to be 100% identical to the
  text in the accompanying text file, so I didn't bother to read much of
  it in the selector. It's nice, but not extraordinary. The music is by
  Pink in THX format, so there's obviously nothign wrong with that aspect
  of the intro :) The party was held from 03-06.07, so obviously the intro
  was released sometime before that. Unfortunately it doesn't contain any
  release date that I can see :( I have no idea if this requires AGA.

  Review: We all knew Pink was an excellent musician - but he kinda took me
  by surprise when he proved to be an excellent coder too! This intro was
  made almost entirely by him, except for some graphics by the always-cool
  Cyclone. There's some quite cool effects here, actually. Certainly a lot
  better than expected! The only thing I really didn't like about this is
  the irritatingly hard-to-read effect logos. These are one readable word

  review: Another excellent little intro from Abyss that doesn't try to
  be anything it isn't! This one has several THX tunes by Pink - which is
  never a bad thing - a colorful opening logo and a new kind of wireframe

  review: "Cruisin II" opens with a requester for one of three "Line-Mode-
  Options". Your three choices are Burnin (classic), Blurin and Clearin.
  Not really knowing what to expect I chose the first (classic =) mode, and
  off to the intro I went. It all opens with a humours sing-along-rendition
  of the classic theme from the movie "Ghostbusters" - here appropriately
  renamed "Gatesbusters". If there's something strange - in your network
  neighbourhood... =)
    Then onto the main part of the demo, which is something as original as a
  wireframe vector intro! It's not as bad as you might think, as there is
  smoothing and pretty cool colours around the wireframes (especially in the
  classic mode =), and...well, it's simply quite original! It's got a
  certain, little amount of...dare I say it...charm? I just find it
  amazingly cool of an established group like Abyss to have the balls to
  release a WIREFRAME intro in 1998! And with style too... Love it!
    The upscroller in the endpart (which is _NOT_ pausable with the right
  mouse button - that button exits, as I discovered) reveals some sad
  news... "Cruisin II" is Dexter's last production for the amiga =( You WILL
  be missed, Dexter...

  amazing effect it is! WOW! You travel down through a tunnel, and the
  tiles get darker the further you get in and it just looks absolutely
  gorgeous...and that's when the balls start bouncing at you! Amazingly
  great and polished. Just fabulous.
    I'm sure I've heard that chip-style tune before somewhere, but in a
  different mix and without those war-drums... hmmm. Anyone? The name
  'Tunnel Demo' does not actually appear anywhere in the demo.

AUT> LaCroix (music trade, 01/00).
GRE> Hfestos (trade, 10/00).
NOR> Fuzzbox (trade ascii, 01/00).

Action was formed by Codetapper as a way to bring several AGA fixers
together and collaborate their skills. Originally Action created single
file AGA fixed games by re-releasing older, cracked games in 'ultimate'
versions, fixed for the new generation of Amigas.
  In October 1999, Codetapper moved the group away from crack fixes and
decided to use WHDLoad (http://www.whdload.org) as the degrading utility and
to concentrate on patching original games (as well as a few cracks for good
measure :) Too many cracks were found to be butchered versions with a lot of
content removed. To this day, Action is still releasing quality fixes at the
rate of about 1-2 per week! Thanks to Codetapper for information.
  1999 - Scottish trader Hoju's last ever email arrived in january saying he
had problems with his Amiga. He was never heard from again and was assumed
to have quit the group. Australian cracker Tachyon left the group in
december.
  2001 - On january 1st, Viz released possibly the first fix of the new
millennium due to NZ's time difference :) English graphics man Sarek joined
in april.

as just Addict! Their Australian division released one issue of the diskmag
"Scene-ery" (Hmm, that name seems awful familiar.... ;), and also the German
division released a couple of issues.
  1992 - The Australian division was formed by Image, who is a real annoying

Boards; JUNKYARD (swe).

Addonic was born ca 07/90, as a merger of the two small groups Aquin and
Overdrive, in addition to Yankee/ex Brainstorm. They were a fairly active
demo group. At least 9 issues of their "Message Center" were released. V-Cut
left his bbs 'ZOOMED REALITY' to a new sysop, Zool, who then joined V-Cut's
previous group Equinox, so the board returned with a new sysop!
  1991 - American sysop Q changed the name of his board '007 BBS' (ex
Endless Piracy) to 'CRYSTAL MONOLITH' and joined Pirates mid 91. Rumours in
"Trader #2" that Addonic UK joined Flashing Bytes is untrue (mid 91). The
entire English division was kicked mid to late 91.
  1992 - Sometime in the first two months of the year, D-Mon sold his Amiga
and left the scene. Also in this time period, the board 'JUNKYARD' joined;
Pripps (trade) joined and german writer and founder Yankee (ex Brainstorm)
left for D-Tect; The entire Polish division of Amaze joined; Epidemic and
Ukulele of the finnish section of Amaze also joined, though Epidemic quickly
moved on to join Complex; also in finland, Legend (music, confirmed 01/92)
and finally Index/Falcons joined. Phew! Norwegian musician Zak (91-) changed
his handle to Scott and joined Spaceballs sometime between january and
april. The finnish section didn't hold together for too long, and finally
died in september; Mac (swap, 11/91-03/92), Index and Gator (03/92) joined
Stellar, while Legend joined Parallax. Also in september, German musician
Chromag left for Dual Crew.
  1993 - German trader and sysop Ronny ('FATAL VISION') joined Zenith early
93.
  1995 - Finnish swapper Splatterhead (doublememb Triflex) left for Flying
Cows Inc. late 95.

  review: This is a class example of 'if you can't do better than this,
  DON'T!' Seriously, I don't mean to be harsh, but come on: scroll, logo,
  vector object? Please!
    Though the scroll clearly credits all graphics to Dragon, the intro
  itself has a logo signed 'Aragon'. Nugie's first production for Addonic.
  His English is not the best, making it hard to decide what he's trying to
  say at times. The intro needs KillAGA, but still destabilizes my system
  after exit.

  review: This is the third Message Center, and another ok release. First of
  all, it loads for a while with an unexciting loadingscreen, before we
  press the left mouse button and is treated to a nice fanfare and an even
  nicer title picture by Old Spook! The 'mag' part itself is not very
  exciting, but that was hardly expected either. This is a messagebox, and
  as such there really isn't that much exciting stuff to read. Apart from
  the messages, there's a handful of adverts, a couple of articles in German
  and finally the group's memberlist. The best part is the title picture.

  review: Coding is much improved since the last issue, offering a wider
  variety of "articles". Nothing spectacular ofcourse, this is still just a
  messagebox, but at least an improvement on the prior issue. These were
  quite popular once, and this is not one of the worst. The intro is barely
  necessary, though. It's not good, and not bad, if you know what I mean.
  As it's just 22k, it would perhaps have been a better idea to link it in
  front of the mag and have the (not bad) tune as a selectable alternative
  to the one in the mag? The mag itself is not too bad either, though it's
  rather unexciting. The best part, I guess, is the B&W loading picture of
  a viking by Old Spook (later E. Toball/Sanity). Luckily the mag is not all
  messages, since that would have been thorougly boring for today. There's
  one or two things of interest, like the French scene report.
  Conclusion: Not bad, but not terribly interesting either.
    The intro needs KillAGA. The editor does not work at all; seeing as it
  does not open its own screen immediately, KillAGA does not help.
  It doesn't crash, but you can't see what you're doing, so... :(
  The 'mag' itself is a little unstable. Sometimes it works perfectly, some
  times the graphics are garbled and sometimes it crashes when loading.
  Once it has loaded, though, I've never experience problems. Or advice is
  to use KillAGA, for safety's sake. The mag loader does not appear to have
  any problems with running from a harddisk, there's no assigns or anything
  necessary.

  review: No code has changed since the last issue, except perhaps some
  improved compatibility. The intro is also the same as last time, so no
  surprises there either. The title pic this time is done by the later
  wellknown graphics duo Groo and Rufferto, and is a graffiti style tag.
  So, the box itself then - any interesting reading this time? Well,
  actually there are a few things. With each issue MC does seem to resemble
  a real diskmag more and more... The editors could be doing a better job,
  though... There are adverts for people who are no longer in the group
  (Aqua), and a few other strange things... Like interviewing the Swedish
  musician Dexter/Shining when they themselves have a swedish swapper with
  the exact same handle :=)

FIN> Mr.Head (music).

Advance was a Finnish demo group, where most of the original six members
were Judge (gfx), Banzai (code), Zoltar (music), Tom (code gfx), Mr.Head
(code) and Mr.Sam (gfx). Everyone except Mr.Sam came from Doom.
  When Advance died, Tom, Banzai and Zoltar joined Complex; Mr.Head, Som and
Judge remain groupless.

· Our First Production/Partydemo (1990, 12.08, ECS File).
  code: Tom, gfx: Mr.Sam (font), music: "Angeldust" by Zoltar (4ch MOD
  format). Released at the Byterapers, Scoopex, Extasy - Grendel Party II.
  review: I didn't get to see much of this small demo; after starting it
  once and finding I'd need KillAGA to view it correctly (the scrollers were
  garbled), I did just that. I saw a few seconds of the demo, with a
  scroller at the top, most of the screen occupied by some plasma-like
  effect and an "Advance" linevectorlogo at the very bottom, then it
  crashed. So That's pretty much it :) The music was nothing special.
    This demo was released twice at this party, with slightly different
  scrolltexts - hence the two titles at the top.

  the screen, and below that a zooming textplotter. Top and bottom are
  single-pixel height copper-bars with cycling colors (you know the kind).
  As a matter of fact, it reminds me a bit of the crackintros at the time!
  The intro says 'remember not 2 greet Venom any longer, we are Agnostic
  Front now'. It is safe to assume this is one of the group's first intros.

  the endless bullshit scrollers =(

  the same one where the "Lotter Intro" was released.

  friendly enough to work with no problems on my machine. It's basically
  just some text over and under the B&W pictures, which you can cycle
  through with your cursor buttons, of people attending the WOC 93 party.
  Not all that interesting.

     (usa), HACKERBASE (swi).

Alcatraz was formed in 1988 by Metalwar (code music), Helix (gfx) and PGCS
(gfx) from the more strangely named Motley Crue Team [no entry]. The first
two have since decided to leave both the group and the scene, leaving PGCS
as the head of the group. Their biggest success must surely have been the
"Odyssey" (12/91) demo, which won the demo competition at the first The
Party! The reason for its success is probably the fact that it was something
new and unique. The debate over whether it should have beaten the runner-up,
"Hardwired" by The Silents and Crionics, raged for months... They were at
one time in a 'trainer coop' with Setrox.
  When most of the Coma members joined, they got the diskmag "McDisk" as an
added bonus. When they stopped doing that, however, a new mag was planned.
This mag was given the name "Compass", and editors were Disney and
ex-McDisk editor Mop. The mag got great reviews, but after just one
released issue Mop left for Essence to be maineditor of "R.O.M" and Disney
left for Sanity to be maineditor on their new mag, which never happened.
  These days, Alcatraz Entertainment Software still exist, but only as a
gamemaking firm, and it's unlikely that any new demos will ever appear.
The remaining members are Quedex, Poseidon, Pigment and Brainbug. I have
seen a short playable demo of a 3D Doom clone type game called IQ, and it
was probably one of the smoothest and bestlooking true 3D engines I've ever
seen; it flows beautifully, and almost reminds me of Duke Nukem 3D!
  Also, check out Hornet's action replay-like utility HRTMon on AmiNet!
  1990 - Swiss trader Moses (who had joined from Setrox 05/90) had a very
brief stay in the group, and by 08/90 he was no longer a member.
  1991 - Famous french musician Moby (ex Dragons, 01/90) joined Dreamdealers
around the middle of the year, after releasing the music disk "More Than
Music" [04/91] in april.
  1992 - In the early months of the year, Control, Mad Butcher, Head, Jackie
D., Mission, Tom Copper, Mop, Nick O'Teen and Aahz joined when Coma died.
Status Quo, Copcom, Nick O'Teen (ex Coma) and Aahz (ex Coma) all got kicked
from the group in september. Jaby joined Absolute! late in the year.
  1993 - Germans Orbit and HMC joined from Dual Crew in march. Their Finnish
section died after graphician Dwel (ex Gator/Stellar, new 93) left to join
Desire, and Razer (code, ex Addonic) joined Stellar in october. Goozer (ex
Disknet) didn't want to be alone, and closed the section by joining
Chryseis, also in october.
  1994 - Editor Mop (ex Coma, new early92) was not content with how things
were going after the first issue of "Compass", and decided to join Essence
in february to edit his own magazine for them, "R.O.M".
  1995 - Norwegian musician Brainbug (06/92-94) joined Talent early 95. He
made the music for a.o. the "Museum" [92] slideshow while he was in
Alcatraz. He's still working for the games by Alcatraz Entertainment
Software, it seems, since he was shown as a member of the games team 01/98.

German swapper Sting left to form Bonzai Brothers, but later decided to
  join Abyss instead. There are LOTS of conflicting information out there
  about this, but I believe what I've given above now is the correct
  portrayal of what happened. When he lost control over Alcatraz, he left
  to form his own group called Bonzai Brothers, and all the German ex
  Alcatraz members joined!
Austrian coder, previous WHQ and coeditor of the now defunt mag "Compass",
  Disney (06/92-93), joined Sanity to be editor of their new diskmag. That
  project never came to fruition, and Disney was consequently kicked. His
  further destiny is unknown.
Swedes Parsec (sysop 'MIDNIGHT EXPRESS', 09/93), La Fayette and Thunor were
  kicked. La Fayette is a female, who worked as cosysop on Parsec's board.
Birdie (ex Yodel) was kicked.
Shade (ex The Silents?/Analog?) joined Scoopex.
Colorbird and Schizo joined from Circle in Sweden, but soon moved on to
  form Illusion.
Two Germans were kicked; swapper Head and coder Mad Butcher (both ex Coma,
  09/92-02/93). Head joined Mirage, but it's unclear what happened to Mad
  Butcher, coder of the 'McDisk' diskmag.
The Germans Link, Dynac, Speedbit (new 03/93), EC-Rider (music, 08/93),
  and Seat were NEVER official Alcatraz members. They were simply let in
  by the other German guys and not by the whole group.
Both the German and Swedish divisions were kicked out. The German duo
  Control (ex Coma, 09/92-08/93) and coder Orbit (ex Dual Crew, new
  03/93-08/93) joined TRSI, the rest of the Germans formed a new crew
  called Fresh. Raw Style (ex DCS), Stearo and Nose (both ex Paradise)
  joined in Germany, but when that division fell apart they all left to join
  Jetset. Swedes Lizardking (music, ex Strange, new late92-03/93) and Tony
  (gfx, ex Voice, new late92-93) joined The Silents.
Blacky (ex Legend) tried to join, but was refused. As a result, Style
  (ex-WHQ, ex Legend) left 03/93 to start a two-man crew with Blacky.
  For additional information, see Style & Blacky's entry.
Graphician Tom Copper (ex Coma, 91) joined Animators.
The germans Bros (code, 12/92-93), Master and Nightlight quickly rejoined
  Scoopex. Bros coded the demo "Crunch-O-Matic" [12/92] while in Alcatraz.
Swiss graphician Fox (04/91-92) left. He worked on a.o. the musicdisks "More
  than Music" [04/91] and "I've Got the Power" [91].
Norwegian coder, organizer and swapper Micro-Pal (editor of "Peanuts"
  packmag, 06/92) joined Banana Dezign. His board 'THE WHITE HOUSE' was
  busted while he was a member of ATZ, but was later reopened in BDZ.
French graphician Alex (old handle Aldyss, 09/92), who released some
  pictures in the slideshow 'MUSEUM', left to join The Silents.
  Still, he made two logos for the "60k Intro" (03/93), so they're
  obviously still on good terms...
Coder Skyman (swi? fra? 01/90) joined Shining. He is the author of "Seven
  Colors" (Infogrames) and all design and music by GFX-MOVIES (late91). He
  also coded the "Cartoons Demo".
Kid Icarus (ex Babygang [no entry], new 03/90) is now Daryl/TRSI (late 91).
  He originally joined as editor of the scene papermag 'B.A.D'.
Norwegian sysop It ('CONTACT ZERO', ex Razor 1911) didn't stay too long
  before moving on to Nemesis (pre 07/92).

· I've Got The Power (1991, ECS Trackloaded Musicdisk).
  code: Hornet, gfx: PGCS, Fox (logo), music: Burgame, Greg (intro).
  review: The main selling point of this musicdisk is a 420k remix of the
  then-popular "I've Got The Power" track by pop group Snap! Still, it's
  not a bad little production. Graphics are very Alcatraz - not great, but
  more than functional. The sword from the top of the screen is
  particularly good, though. There's not much code to speak of here.
  Greg's intro music could have been great, but sounds a little unpolished.

· Museum (1992, early, ECS Trackloaded Slideshow).

  review: This is a slideshow from three different graphicians, so the array
  of style is quite varied. There's 18 different pictures to be seen here,
  choosable from a picture selector. Some of them (PGCS') have already been
  seen in Odyssey, but they're the best here, so we don't mind the repeat
  too much. The music is okay. It doesn't irritate, at least!
    This is quite rare, actually - this production works PERFECTLY on an
  accelerated machine in 1997. Apart from the fact that some of the intro
  effects are fast as hell (at least that means they're not precalced!),
  there's nothing wrong at all. That's a refreshing change, hehe...

  Review: This is good! It's got a good sense of pace, good music, several
  nice effects and two good logos by Alex! Alex left Alcatraz for
  Dreamdealers a little earlier, but still made these logos for them...
  Perhaps as a sign of 'no bad feelings'? This intro announces the joining
  Orbit, HMC, and Speedbit, and is is therefore a sort of 'welcome' intro.
  It also announces the leaving of Style.

  nothing very exciting... The music tries to be
  thumping, but at 26k that's a hard thing to do. I'm sorry, atz, but this
  never really came alive for me. Those 55 frames of animation weren't very

  4th in the Assembly 94 demo competition.
  Review: Whoa! I'm sure this kicked ass on the big screen! This baby
  features some rather revolutionary (I'm sure) effects for its time.
  There are some reasonably fast effects here, to be sure! Especially the
  mapped objects during the main part and the 'flight sim' part at the end
  impressed me. The music is nothing special, just functional. It's plain
  to see that both Hornet and PGCS improved their skills a lot since
  "Odyssey". Especially one of the ATZ logos by PGCS was nice... Still, I
  expected more from a 4-disk demo... Suddenly it was just over.
    The bigfiles are just lots of XPK'ed files linked together. There were
  additional versions released after the party; this review refers to
  version 1.3 (25.09.1994). Though it will run from disk on an A1200 with
  enough mem, the documentation says it suggests a 030 and a harddisk.
  When installing, remember to assign "Ilyad1:" to "Ilyad4:" to your
  directory. The documentation makes no mention of this, I believe, so I
  had to hex-read the executable to find out :)

  Compass #1 (1994, early, ECS Diskmag).
  info: Compass (or the COMputer Article Spreading Site) was a fresh start
  by mostly the same people that worked on McDisk. Alcatraz released a text
  file (published in Scoopex' packmag 'Nevermind' #48) to announce the
  imminent release of Compass, "early 1994". Unfortunately, it only survived
  for a single issue before most of the team behind it left the group for
  new, better things.

  Split 7th in The Party 95 demo competition.
  review: The first thing that strikes you about this production is 'WOW!'
  The second thing that strikes you, is 'shame about the design'.
  And that's the biggest problem with it: Virtually no attention has been
  assigned to the design of the thing! It's got lots of cool, heavy
  effects, a couple of cool pics (Lazur's Alien pic is FAAAAANTASTIC!),
  but not much work on putting it all together. With all this graphical
  talent working on the demo, I can only be disappointed that the potential
  was far from fulfilled.

  review: This invitation intro is a sad affair really, with a scroller at
  the bottom and three sucky pictures to change between using the space
  bar. It gets the job done, but it's not pretty, and it sounds awful.
  Sorry to be so harsh on you Alchemy, but this intro isn't really one to
  make you stand up and take notice.

Alchemy was originally a Polish group, though a Norwegian division was new
in Propaganda #4. Johan (old handle Frodo) stopped drawing. In a filemag
(rel late 95), I found two ads for swapping by Exolon - one where he's in
this group, and one where he's in Tilt... Other productions I know of from
this group is "Party Zanci" (intro) and "Toxic Ziemniak" (trackmo).

M-Iron left.
Polish musician Accord (06-09/93) was kicked, for no apparent reason (PRP4).

Alliance Design was probably born in the first few months of 1991 - at least
that's when their first productions started appearing. They were a french
demo group, with strong links to the illegal scene. They were the Quartex
demo division for quite a while, and released what is probably their best-
known demo, "Substance" [04/91], for them. After they left Quartex, there
were rumours that they became a Crystal subgroup instead, but this is
untrue.
  1991 - French graphician Mack (who joined in april) left again for Scoopex
just a few months after. Frenchmen Walt (gfx) and Motif (code) joined from
The Silents around september.
  1992 - PMC's "R.A.W #2" [02/92] announced Corto was working on the group's
next demo, "Land of Liquor", to feature music by Moby. As history proved,
this demo unfortunately never saw the light of day =(. Corto was busted for
blueboxing early in the year, and rumours spread that this lead to the death
of the group. This was even published in Pure Metal Coders' diskmag "R.A.W
#3" [07/92], but it can't be true since the group was later active again,
and released a demo as late as january 93. What is true is that Walt and
Motif left the group for Melon Dezign.

French graphicians Zebig and 7th Eye joined Dreamdealers (pre 07/92).
Frenchman Traitor (04/91) joined Crystal.

AFL is one of the oldest Amiga groups still in existence, formed in 1987,
mostly dealing in the illegal part of the scene. There is also an Alpha
Flight 1970 (AFL'70) on the c64 still in existence, as well as a pc section
- though their current status is unknown. In their early years, they were
also one of the first groups to have subgroups - and they had lots of
them! Some of the most known were Vision One, Zylon and Z-Dream (see
separate entries). Please note that not only did everyone else get confused,
so did AFL on a few occasions! For example, they printed in their mag that
Satan/AFL joined D-Tect, when infact Satan was in their subgroup Vision One!
  They also released one of the first regular diskmags - and certainly the
best at its time - for the Amiga, in the shape of "Cracker Journal".
  The situation with Belgian board 'THE FLYING SAUCER' is confusing; is
Cocaine and Dr.Avalanche or Uli sysop? Anyone can help me shed some light on
this? Other prodcutions released by AFL, where I have minimum information,
is "Blitter Madness" (file), "Scroll On an Ham Picture" (file), "Cracker
Journal Special issue #1" (diskmag), "Vector" (demo, coop Demons), "Megabob"
(demo, coop Genesis), "Dark" (slideshow, coop Genesis), "Soundbox"
(musicdisk, coop Shadowlight), "Soundbox II The Return" (1989 musicdisk,
coop Genesis), "Musiccompacting 1" (musicdisk, coop Mindwarp), "Megademo II"
(demo, coop Mindwarp), "Sinus" (intro, coop Paradox), "Grafitti" (demo, coop
Shadowlight), "Guest Starring" (file), "Defenda Crack Intro" (intro), "Best
Bob" (demo).
  1988 - The first issue of "Cracker Journal" [01/88] opened the year, and
was received well by the scene. 10 More issues and a few demos would come
before the end of a very successful year, when they established CJ as the #1
diskmag! Issue #10 [11/88] was released in november, and finally #11 was
released at the very end of the year.
  1989 - Their subgroup Prophets AG left to be an independent group in
february. German graphician Dark joined Black Monks late 89.
  1990 - Captain Power left, Blackout joined TRSI and Sledge joined Defcon
One late in the year. Destroyer and Nike joined Skid Row late 90, but at
least Destroyer later returned.
  1991 - Psychon changed handle to Anvil and joined Black Monks in the
middle of the year. German sysop Destroy ('PARADISE') was busted on the 14th
of june! Luckily, he had time to format his HD before he let the cops in, so
damage was not as hard as it could have been. Following this, there was
widespread panic on the German scene, and lots of boards decided to close
shop. Germans Hajo (trade), TCI (sysop 'SKARA BRAE'), Accu (sysop 'RIVER
SIDE'), FDT (trade, 12/90) and Ginger all left to form a new group called
Venture late 1991. Later also Krypton (sysop 'CONTROL TOWER' opened 09/91)
and Gizmo (gfx) joined. FDT was one of the AFL leaders at the time, and his
position was filled by Rator and Sabine. Swedish sysop Trodac ('UNFORGIVEN')
left in december for Aurora.
  1992 - Swedish sysop Dexter ('TOTAL DISASTER', doublememb Comakids) joined
Aurora around january. German Headhunter joined The Silents early in the
year. Vindex left to join Anthrox and Winger (ex Noxious) was kicked out in
september. Winger joined Scoopex and did not leave the scene, as stated in
R.A.W #3.
  1993 - Roger Rabbit joined Fusion early in the year. German musician SMT
left for Infect in may. In may, the group had a staggering 82 members (duos
counted as one)!! Among these were no less than 4 female members Germany!
Speedlock left in october.
  1995 - The board 'DATASTORM' went offline in june.

Finnish sysop Kristen joined either Decnite or Love/Desire.
American sysop Dr.Feelgood ('OVERDOSE') joined Recline.
American sysop Nightvision ('THUNDERDOME', old handle Master Blaster, 11/91-
  05/93) left. He was also a supplier for consoles.
Cyclotronic (gfx, ex Jump, 08/93) left.
Dutch sysop THC ('MYSTIC PLACE', early93) joined Justice.
Finnish swapper Velsa (ex Calibra, new mid 93) quickly moved on to join
  Accession.
American sysop Winter Mute ('MARTYRIUM', ex Classic, 11/91) joined Infinite
  Perfection.
Musician Thexder (ex Assult) left to join Atomic.
Hot and Pha left.
Dutch sysop Sal-One ('BOONDOCKS') joined TRSI.
Psycho Demon (ex Nuance) and Raxxion joined Scoopex.
Finnish swapper and trader Black Sheep (ex Zakka/Rebels) left soon after
  joining and moved on to Accession late93.
Salvatore (ex Paranoid) joined Scoopex, he wasn't kicked! Other sources
  claimed he joined Addicts.
German sysop Wolfgang ('CHINATOWN') was kicked.
English Kitaro, sysop 'MILLENNIA' joined Fairlight.
Magic joined Vision. News in R.A.W #3 that he joined Defjam are probably
  false.
Virus joined Palace.
Dr.No and Zacae joined Bloodsuckers.
Punisher (who joined with Winger from Noxious) left the scene.
Swedish sysop Xstaz ('ICE PALACE', ex Spirit) joined Noxious. He later
  returned to AFL, that's why he's on the memblist.
Germans Sniffy and Helioth joined Vision (pre 07/92). In Vision, they're
  suddenly sysops of 'SPIRITUAL HEALING'...were they in AFL too?
American sysop Flashback ('CYBERTECH') joined Vision (pre 07/92).
English sysops Sabbath and Undertaker ('GRAVEYARD', ex Quartex) left for the
  PC scene.
German swapper and trader Galaxy joined Skid Row mid to late 90.

  review: Now, THIS is history - the very first issue of CJ! Ofcourse, this
  is entirely in German, so I didn't understand much. It's amazing, though,
  how little it changed over the first issues.
    Though the mag itself works satisfactory, the intro does not. No matter
  what I attempt, it always gurus. There are no real credits to be seen
  anywhere, except for in a few of the articles.

  review: The second issue is a marked improvement as far as content goes,

  for some people's liking, but I guess that's a matter of opinion.
  Unlike the first issue, nothing works here; neither the intro or the

  Review: Remarkably, this issue of CJ seems to be a lot better laid out, a
  lot more compatible and a has a lot better English than the only other
  issue I have - #28! There's also not the same sense of showelware - all
  of these articles were MEANT for the mag, they're not just files off the
  boards! There's more articles in German here, though. The mag's content
  is quite limited, at just over 50 articles, but they are one hell of a
  lot more interesting than the ones in #28... There doesn't appear to be
  any kind of credits except for the articles in the mag itself, but then
  again there's not much code to speak of... You see, each and every
  article is an IFF file, so all the coder had to make was a picture shower
  that could change pictures and play some music in the background :)
    I like the atmosphere in this. There's a genuine sense of stumbling to
  establish the scene. These were pioneers, and as such ofcourse there were
  two mistakes for every innovation. Still, they make their small mistakes
  with unmistakable amounts of charm. Nice, this is.

  review: This issue was the first to feature the new code for the mag,
  meaning no more iff pictures! That alone was an enormous step up...
  Design did not change significantly, only the inner workings of the mag
  did. I have chosen not to rate Satan/Vision One/AFL's small intro here,
  since it's not AGA compatible and really little more than a boot intro.
    The compatibility rating is only for the magpart, the intro for this
  mag does not run under AGA. Also, I had to run the mag with caches off,
  or my keyboard would not respond after a while. Otherwise, no probs!

Amaze was a demo group based in Germany, but also with strong divisions in
other countries.
  Some Amaze releases where I have only a minimum of information is
"Released Before" (intro, c: Dr.Gassu, g: Galaxy, m: "Hawk" by
?/Timecircle), 31st May (demo, c: Dr.Gassu, g: Galaxy, m: "Ode To Mon Part2"
by Galaxy), Lamerbug (game, c: Dr.Gassu, g: Tune, m: "Lamerbug!" by Tsaca),
Kriepss Again (demo, c: Zecco, g: Galaxy, m: "IQ64" and "Shape It Down" by
Galaxy), Crack of Dawn (ECS File), Generation issue #1 (ECS Diskmag).

  1990 - The group received two new German members around july, when
swappers Bomber and Pinhead joined from the Celtic subgroup Highlander.
November saw the joining of Italian multitalent Filippetto from Savage with
his diskmag. "Freedom Crack #4" [12/90] was the first and only issue of the
mag to be released for Amaze.
  1991 - When the German section of Amaze died in january, Filippetto ended
his short-term stay in the group, and left (with his diskmag) to form his
own group, named Vega.
  1992 - The group's WHQ board 'THE PARTY ZONE' changed name to 'SERPENT
SOCIETY', while Norwegian Edison and Swedes Slider (code) and Abandon (code)
joined around january. The two finns Epidemic (code, 06-07/91) and Ukulele
(music, ex Intuition, 06-07/91) both joined Addonic around january, though
Epidemic quickly moved on to Complex. Breeze (code) also joined Complex,
while Snowman was kicked; Wizmar left the scene; Df0: (gfx, 07/91-), Breeze
(code), Dwarf and PMB all left for Dual Crew; swedish Stanton/Anarchy (sysop
'3AM ETERNAL') joined; danish Phraizer (sysop 'PHANTASIA') joined; american
Nightstalker (sysop 'PRISONERS OF REALITY') joined - all around january.
Also the entire polish section of Amaze joined Addonic at this time!
Norwegian swapper Viking (ex Byte Busters) joined LSD early 92. Swedish
Sudden left for Spirit early 92. Tropic was kicked from the group because of
lazyness early 92. Swedish sysop Xstaz changed the name of his board from
'DEADLINE' to 'THE ICE PALACE' and joined Spirit early 92. Amaze Austria is
dead. Dalmet and Sledge joined Grace. Charly left the scene 09/92. Pulstar
left to form Slipstream finland 09/92. German leader Damion (ex Addonic, 92)
joined Platin 09/92. Swedish Bit (ex Palace) left to form Sonic sweden

Ice/Royal Amiga Force) joined Razor 1911 (pre 07/92).

Finnish Boomer joined TRSI.
German swapper Zaphod joined Sanity old.
German musician and editor RokDaZone (ex Kraze) joined Destiny.
The two swedes Buntz and Zonic (who between them ran the board 'SERPENT
  SOCIETY' old name 'PARTY ZONE'), joined Defjam. Zonic was also the WHQ,
  after he took over the duty from Articfox. Here's a theory of my own:
  Buntz changed his name to Zonic, AND THEN...
Genestealer joined Cult.
Finnish El Gringo left the scene.
Dr.Gassu joined Elysion.
The German editor of "Disktrash", Death Angel (02/92), was kicked (RAW3).

  X-Tasy.
German Sodom joined Beyond (pre 07/92).
Gipsy King joined Midway (pre 07/92).
Abaddon joined Fairlight (pre 07/92).
The Norwegian division left and split up. Dreamer (ex Chris/Grace) joined
  Pure Metal Coders. Frequenz (sysop, ex Decept) joined Razor 1911. I have
  one additional member, Edison (Øystein Homelien), but I don't know what
  happened to him...though he's now boss at the internet provider Powertech
  Information Systems in Norway!
Powersledge joined Flash Productions.
Swedish sysop Psychopath ('RAISING HELL') joined Triad.
Decoy left Amaze in 91, and is now (96) in Passion.

  review: Well, first impressions are not so good, the intro guru'ed...
  Tried again with KillAGA, and it worked but destabilized my system...
  Thankfully the mag can be loaded on its own, so we try that. Well, this is
  very first issue of a mag that would grow to be legendary, but in respect
  we must say that they still had a long way to go. The first issues were
  more message and newsoriented, and had very little mag-content, to be
  honest, and in that respect it sortof works...But this was after all 1992,
  and there were MUCH better mags and boxes out there! It's a first release,
  that's all.

------------------------------
DEN> Adonis (swap, ex Passion, new late97), Misery (org gfx, ex Insane, 97),
     Nigel (code, ex Impact, new late97).

Amaze Design is a Danish demo group formed in 1997 by Misery and Nigel from
Insane and Impact Inc. It is highly unlikely that the old Amaze has anything
to do with this new group. They died after a very short while.

???> Dr.Zulu (gfx, late97), Karina (mascot, new 06/96), Nook (gfx, new

Ambrosia is a demo group based in denmark, and active on both the Amiga and
pc platforms. They were organized by Raze and Drac, until Raze stopped
organizing 06/96. Powdihacker then became the new second organizer, it seems
- until he also left. Their mascot Karina is, obviously, female.
  The recent smash hit doom clone game "Genetic Species" was made by the
Danish Ambrosia members Powdihacker (code), Cain (gfx), Shadow Walker (gfx)
and Trayzor (sound)! Other Ambrosia productions that I have only a minimum
amount of information on are: "Psychopack #2 Packmenu" (intro), "Genetic
Species" (aga hd demo - of the game, presumably?), "Miracle Chips #1" (aga
intro) and "Scenemeeting Invitation" (aga intro).
  1995 - Spiderwork, Mr.Salinas, The Crow, Kallestrup and Jolly Roger were
all kicked late in the year. Sardonyx' "Seenpoint #2" [12/95] reported that
Raze and Drac are the new organizers, that Jaxx left the group to become
independent, that Cyboman/Balance joined, that Raivo/Black Jack joined and
that Tricktrax joined from Tribe.
  1997 - Artwork's "Generation #24" [04/97] reports that Spacebrain (music)
joined, that Cyboman changed his handle to Eliss-D, that danish Powdihacker
(org code, 12/95-) left for Puzzle, that danish Artphaze (gfx, new late96)
left the group and probably the scene, that Drac joined Cosmic Woodheads as
a doublemember, and finally that a pc section had been established.

Dutch swapper Coolio (new late96) changed his handle to Blunt and joined
  TRSI.
Musician Trayzor (12/95) left late 96.
Vaxx left to be independent late 95.

  16th or 24th in The Party 5 40k intro competition.
  review: It's an OK intro, this. There's some OK effects, like a zoom-
  rotator with 'jerky' zooming and an OK voxel routine. The chiptune is
  functional, with a very good tune for the end part. It's a remake of an
  actual tune that was on the charts. My girlfriend recognized the tune as
  being called 'Jimmie Dean', but couldn't remember the name of the group.
  Very good.

  review: Another good TP5 intro from Ambrosia, this one gives us a

  though. The opening Rynkeby logo is awful.

  review: There is one thing about Ard that draws it down a lot; The fact
  that the entire demo is presented in that 'ghosted' mode, that apparently
  saves a lot of rastertime on c2p routines. There's just one drawback with
  this: IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK HALF AS GOOD AS SOLID ROUTINES! Other than
  that, the demo has an altogether average feel to it. The code is OK, I
  guess, but the graphics and music are so average it hurts. The whole
  thing has a 'rushed together' feel to it, made further evident by the
  fact that this demo was released out of competition at TG.

Amiga Freelancers (AF)
----------------------
NOR> Zap (code).

AF rose from nothing to instant fame when they released the first version
of ProTracker 1.0, and stayed there until they had released their final
version. Until PT arrived, sceners had had to make do with the limited
NoiseTracker by the Swedes Mahoney & Kaktus. When PT 1.1 introduced things
like a built-in sampler and an online help system, there was no turning
back. In a way, AF got their name in the Amiga demoscene history books on
the back of one single production...

  1997 - Polish graphician and musician Dave (ex Freezers, new late96) left

find a suitable new group, and remained groupless for the remainder of 1997,
before now joining Haujobb. Dave made music for the "Hazchemix" [11/96] demo

  review: This demo possesses an amazing amount of atmosphere! As a result
  of the visuals, the great and moody music (mind you, I usually hate this
  kind of thing) and the widescreen display you're almost spellbound the
  first time you see it. There's almost NO text or graphics, just the
  visuals. Large portions of phong and bump effects are the order of the
  day, and these routines seem both fast and smooth (at least on my 030 :).

  review: What struck me after seeing Versor was, 'this is just like an
  Azure intro - only more blocky!' You see, we're presented here with a few
  effects that are quite a lot like some of what Azure did in "Dawn.Remix"
  and other intros - the difference being that Azure's routines were 1x1.
  The intro opens with an envmapped logo, which is afterburned and finally
  fades away. Then we're shown a Versor logo and some other graphics,
  before another envmapped object, this time with some transparency. The
  show ends with the Versor logo from before being blown up to fill the
  whole screen, and a phong env object appears on top of it - before it
  starts to morph, and spikes shoot out of it. One cool thing about this
  intro is the graphics smoothing used here, which seems extremely
  effective! All effects have background graphics. The music is quite
  anonymous - I can't really remember how it went now :) The intro opens
  and ends with a badly drawn image of a tree. Anyone know the significance
  of this?
    The intro itself contains no credits, except the fact that the
  signature on Kazik's logo is plainly visible. Anyone know who coded and
  wrote the music for this intro? The logo can be extracted by decrunching
  the file (packed with Imploder) and using a tool like WRip to extract the
  iff file.

  review: Not my favorite demo, but still not bad from the new Polish
  masters. The most disappointing thing about this demo is the graphics!
  With a quality pixeler like Lazur working on it, I expected a lot better
  than what I got...and Kazik's pictures weren't much comfort. Some nice
  effects, bump, env and the usual shit, and a tune that doesn't get TOO
  irritating makes it pass the grade. Above average but lacks the final
  spark... The txt file in the demo directory suggests it was meant as a
  contribution for The Party 6. I have no idea how much memory it requires,
  but at least it ran fine with 4mb fast!

Anarchy spent some time as the definitive 'super-group' of the demo scene,
before it grew too big and simply died. When they were on top, though, they
produced what are some of the most well-remembered demos ever... However,
when the best members went and formed Lemon. on 1st February 1993, they
pretty much nailed the coffin. After a little while, the remainders of the
group decided that the blow was too hard, and they'd rather quit on top
than keep going at half speed. Dan and Nuke were involved with the making
of several games for Core Design while still in Anarchy, like Chuck Rock.
  There has NEVER been a member called Striker and Zoom was never kicked
despite rumours in some mags.
  1990 - English coder Del joined the group from Mayhem sometime between
april and december. In october, the group was reinforced with Mystik (gfx),
Dan (code gfx) and Kris (code) from Reaktor. Dan soon released his first
production for his new group, the demo "Madness" [10/90]. Come december and
the "Stolen Data #5" [12/90] - their best yet - they also announced the
joining of English musicians Nuke and Cosmos, as well as the leaving of
Raistlin (code, 07/90-) and Pioneer who both left the group to concentrate
on their educations.
  1991 - Germans Mike (sysop 'STATE OF MIND', 09/91), Cyfreak and Koto
left for Endless Piracy in september. The entire french section of The
Silents were recruited late in the year - possibly as early as september,
but more likely around december. These members were Audiomonster (who
returned to TSL after just a few days), Conquest, NHP, BKH, Performer,
Ronan, Rookie, Surfer and Zoom.
  1992 - All Swedish and Finnish members were kicked around january,
according to R.A.W #2, 'because of their extreme lazyness and bad
attitudes.' Swedish sysop Stanton ('3AM ETERNAL') joined Amaze around
january, possibly as a sideeffect of the above. French coder DCA joined from
Rebels and danish musician Maestro joined from Kefrens around january.
Come the beginning of april, the group arranged the Anarchy Easter Party in
Barnsley, England, which was even visited by their foreign members (Facet).
The group themselves came 1st with the trackmo "Krestmass Leftovers" [04/92]
(Krest/Critical Mass) and third with the musicdisk "Legalise It..." [04/92]
(Dan/Facet/Nuke) in the demo competition =) The scrolltext in the musicdisk
revealed that Rush had now moved to England, and was working as a programmer
at Core Design alongside Dan. The french section released their first
production for Anarchy - the musicdisk "Spring Melodies" [04/92] - at the
Eastern Conference in Belgium a little later in april.
  1993 - On the 1st of february 1993, a large portion of Anarchy's most
talented members in England, Denmark and Holland left to form a new, smaller
group called 'Lemon.' These members were Facet (hol gfx, ex Vision, new
late91), Dan (eng code, ex Reaktor, new 10/90), Nuke (eng music, new
12/90), Hannibal (den code, ex The Silents, old handle Sunjohn, 12/91),
Slash (den gfx, ex Flash Productions, 12/91), Mad Freak (den music, 12/91)
and Paradroid (eng code, ex Digital, new 07/92). Indirectly, it was this
act that killed Anarchy. Left without its best members, people starte
losing their confidence in the supergroup, and started leaving in droves.
A few months later they were stone dead. Later, dutch graphician Danny (ex
Mirage) also joined Lemon. The two Danes ICronite and Milkshake (both ex
Rebels), who participated in such fine productions for Anarchy as "Digital
Innovation" [91] and "Hardcore" [12/92], left to form Camel Corporation in
February 1993. Frenchmen NHP & BKH (org music, 04-12/92), Conquest and Zoom
(all 04/92, all ex The Silents) joined Scoopex in early 1993. After Anarchy
died, the Englishmen Judge Drokk (Mark, org editor 'Stolen Data', 02/90-
04/92), 4-Mat (Matthew Simmonds, music, 07/90-12/92), Mystik (gfx, ex
Reaktor, new 10/90-12/92), Krest (code) and Critical Mass (code) all decided
to end their involvement with the scene. 4-Mat's music has since graced
several games, as you all know, and it is believed that Kris (code, ex
Reaktor, new 10/90) joined him in gamemaking land. This is NOT confirmed,
however.
  Del (Derek Leigh-Gilchrist) is today a game programmer at Codemasters.

French painter Suny (ex Rebels, 12/92) joined Movement.
Arpegiator (music) joined Chryseis late 92.
French coder Ronan (ex The Silents, 04/92) joined Sanity.
  Ronan coded the musicdisk "Spring Melodies" [04/92] for Anarchy.
Finns Destop (gfx) and WDO (code) rejoined CNCD.
English coder and graphician Kreator (Michael Troughton, production editor
  'Stolen Data', 07/90-12/92) landed a job at Reflections (the people behind
  the 'Shadow of the Beast' games) and consequently left the scene at the
  end of january 1993.
In the middle of january, Danes Slammer (code) and Xience (gfx, both ex
  Rednex) joined Melon Dezign. Later also Solnova (gfx) joined. Slammer and
  Xience collaborated on the trackmo "In The Kitchen" (06/92) for Anarchy.
French swapper Mental (ex Atlantys) joined Absolute! early 93. In addition,
  I saw an ad in Generation #6 where he says 'After to have left Anarchy,
  Willow I re-joined Anarchy!'. I added the relevant information to Willow's
  entry. To make confusion total, there were news in Eurochart #17 that he
  had left for PMC shortly after joining!
Englishmen Mole (12/90) and Mr.Big (02-12/90) left the scene in the latter
  part of 1992. Mr.Big was editor of "Stolen Data" for a while.
The German section fell apart after the people behind the "Flower Power"
  [10/92] demo (Crux, Tron, E.Toball and MCM (all ex Dual Crew)) were
  kicked. Slick (ex Cyberactive) was also kicked, and because of this Pinny
  (Christian) left. The German section is therefore dead. Tron joined
  Sanity, MCM joined Spaceballs, E.Toball joined Complex and Crux (ex
  Dual Crew) joined Adept. RAW5 claimed that Tron also joined Complex, this
  is untrue.
Danish musician Maestro (Martin Agger, ex Kefrens old) was kicked because of
  lazyness and not being involved with the scene at all. On the 14th of June
  1996, he died in Aarhus, Denmark, at the age of 24. RAW5 claimed he joined
  Kefrens, but that's not true.
Norwegian coder and swapper Octoplex (ex Gate, new 12/90) joined Palace.
French graphician Titan (ex Atlantys) joined Digital.
Swedes Lexter (code), Mosh (code, 11/90) and Dexter (music, new 09/91)
  joined Shining (pre 03/92).
Swedish sysop Norad ('ACES HIGH' WHQ) joined Virtual.
Tama (ex Euphoria) left the scene.
German Maec is NOT a member of Anarchy.
French coder Performer (ex The Silents) joined Melon Dezign. He was never a
  member of Rebels, as some people claimed.
Belgian Cybersonik (ex Cult) who worked as coeditor on Stolen Data for a
  while, was kicked by Trix! He therefore joined Alcatraz 09/92.
French trader Rhod (ex Rebels old) left the scene. The information in RAW3
  that he was kicked seems to be untrue, especially since both the next RAW
  and Anarchy's own mag Stolen Data confirms he left.
French swapper Surfer (David Pointu, ex The Silents) left the scene.
  Conquest took over the organizing of the French section.
French coder DCA (ex Rebels old) joined The Silents.
Mike D. (ex Sanity, RAW1) joined Complex.
The entire French division of The Silents joined. However, a few days later
  Audiomonster returned to TSL.
Finns Golem (gfx, ex Gate, new 12/90-91) and Major Tom joined Carillon.
Banger and Mediator (Andrew, eng code, 07-10/90) left Anarchy mid 91. Banger
  first joined Punishers, and later left the scene altogether.
German sysop Bomber ('PEARL HARBOUR' opened 09/91) joined Crusaders late91.
Finnish musician Bruno (ex Gate, new 12/90-91) joined SCUP. Bruno released
  the musicdisk "Bruno's Music Box 3" (91) while in Anarchy.
Igor (gfx, 07/90-04/91), Fobia and Cosmos (eng music, new 12/90) got kicked.
Finnish coder and graphician Wraith (Mika Keskikiikonen, ex Gate, new
  12/90) left the scene 91; a decision he announced in Anarchy's "Bruno's
  Music Box III".

· Demo Dolly Mixture No.01 (ECS Intro).
  code: Zarch, gfx: Marvin (logo), Igor (font), music: "Popkorn" by Nuke
  (4ch MOD format).
  review: This intro precedes the first ever issue of Anarchy's packseries
  Demo Dolly Mixture (compiled by Cosy), and is very very standard. The
  music is a suitably cheery chip affair, and the obligatory logo at the top
  of the screen is nicely done, if a little unimaginative. The rest is just
  the normal text and scroller. This is the kind if intro you are likely to
  see a hundred of... Please note that this is NOT a selector, just an
  intro, the selection itself was probably done in DOS. The intro does not
  in any way indicate any release date.

  review: The very first issue of SD opens with a good intro - colorful and
  professional. Then on to the mag itself... You are first taken to a menu,
  where you can choose to see one of three new demos (so it's almost a pack
  too!), the charts or the mag itself. The menu is a little much, really,
  too colorful and overcrowded for a diskmag. SD was originally on both
  paper and disk, with the papermag containing the bulk of the material...
  As a result, the editorial content of this first issue is VERY limited.
  In fact, you'll read this mag from start to end in about 10 minutes...

  review: The coding of this mag remains mostly the same as last time, only
  the music and text seem to have changed significantly. It's still both
  disk- and paperbased, with the paper edition having most of the
  significant information - sadly. There are just two demos on the disk this
  time, Red Sector's "Follow Me" and Rebels "Vectors 1990", but in addition
  there are also two small utilities, Boot Memory Clear and Music Ripper for
  Titanics Cruncher by Punisher/Anarchy.
    The different heading above for this review means INT (intro), MEN
  (menu), MAG (magazine) and CHA (charts). The mag was released in february,
  but after MF's Select party (03-04.02), so probably sometime around mid
  february.

  to read here yet, most of the material was still being used for the paper

  extra material was used for the three winning tunes from their music

  some remarkable new graphical talent - namely Havok - just adding spice to
  the package. This time the limitations of the mag code became painfully
  obvious, when there was just not enough room with just one magpart for all
  the text, and the mag had to be split in two! A remarkable improvement
  over previous issues.
    The intro for the mag announced the joining of English musicians Nuke
  and Cosmos, as well as the leaving of Raistlin and Pioneer who leaves the
  group to concentrate on their educations.

· Legalise It... (1992, 04.04, ECS Musicdisk).
  code: Dan, gfx: Facet, music: Nuke.
  3rd in the Anarchy Easter Party 92 demo competition!
  review: Beautiful in its simplicity, "Legalise It..." is a classic among
  amiga musicdisks. Facet's perfect design touches makes us fondly remember
  why he was considered one of the strongest graphical talents in the scene
  back then, and Nuke's perfect blend of jazzy and 'finnish-sounding' tunes
  (can't help but think of Bruno, Dizzy and most of all Heatbeat when
  hearing "Nassum Peliti" =) shows us a musical talent at the height of his
  scene life. And Dan's coding makes it all come together, creating a
  production with an almost perfect sense of "flow". After a brief intro
  sequence, we are presented with a main menu for choosing - among other
  things - what tunes to listen to. In addition, the function keys F1-F5
  also allows us other choices; F1 means a selection of scrollers, F2 is an
  info screen on the currently played music, F3 is a credits sequence, F4
  gives us a greetings scroller (they originally wanted to have a separate
  part for this too, but didn't have time), while finally F5 gives us our
  'bonus' - a fullscreen picture of a dwarf warrior by Facet! The layout of
  the main menu screen is simplicity itself, but nevertheless the overall
  effect is one of professionality. An ANARCHY logo resides at the top,
  under which the names of the six tunes are highlighted. Below this is a
  simple scroll, and below that again a panel of the five function keys as
  described above. Though this musicdisk is clearly inspired by
  Phenomena/Scoopex/Rebels' "Crystal Symphonies" [91], it lives perfectly in
  its own right as a classic example of the magic that the scene could
  create once upon a time... The disk offers six tunes on offer, none of
  which to my knowledge was released before. They are "Velomatrix" (2:42),
  "Nassum Peliti" (3:50), "Love Funk" (3:08), "Time For Loving" (2:28), "Je
  L'Ai Deja Vu" (2:33) and "Bloe Job" (3:41).
    "Legalise It..." was originally supposed to be a cooperation musicdisk
  between Nuke and Maestro, but unfortunately Maestro's music did not arrive
  in time for inclusion on the disk. Even before it was finished, a second
  installment was planned, as made evident by several of the scrolltexts.
  Its release date was supposedly to be the end of april or beginning of may
  - but it did not surface until november! The scrolltexts also kind of
  "announced" Rush had moved to England and had secured a job at Core
  Design, working alongside Dan.
    This review was made not of the original version, but of the 'fixed' one
  released by Stingray/Darkage in june of 2001. This not merely a whdload
  version or similar, Stingray has resourced the entire demo, and fixed
  EVERYTHING - even sample and module replayers - to work correct on all 68k
  cpus - without denting performance on older machines. As he says, it
  should still work on the original configuration of an A500.

  review: Just weeks after he joined, Paradroid released this small, rushed
  trackmo that still smells strongly of a professional attitude towards
  demo coding. Paradroid also did most of his own graphics - and very well
  he did them too. I guess this makes him Dan's equal, in that they're
  coder-graphicians, which is a rare combination indeed. Nuke's main tune
  is a very bland disco affair, but the end tune is a much better, slower
  affair. The code consists of mainly vector routines, but they're strictly
  state-of-the-art for the period, including stuff like ellipses and
  complex shading. The graphics and design are what sets it a little
  apart from the crowd, though. Very nice, if I may say so. I cannot vouch
  for this needing the full 1MB or being just 512k.

  review: Since this demo no longer works on my current hardware, I will
  have to write this review largely from memory. What I can remember,
  though, is some excellent craftmanship, in all respects. I remember this
  demo for Nuke's great music, I remember it for Facet's great 'Hardcore'
  title picture, and I remember it for its revolutionary vector code, with
  complex effects like space cutting.
    Technically, this demo consists of three files; one small loader and
  two data files. The executable and the first data files were packed with
  the absolute address cruncher Time Cruncher 1.7, which may go a long way
  in explaining why it doesn't work anymore. Rush, ICronite or Dan - please
  release a working copy! The files must all be on a disk in df0: for the
  demo to work. When you attempt to load the demo, it prints a little text
  in the cli window, starts loading the first data file, and when it's
  done the machine guru's. This also happens with caches off, kicking down
  to 1.3 etc. Believe me, I've tried it all...

Andromeda must surely be one of the most successful demo groups of all
time. Productions like the "Mirror" [12/92] musicdisk and the "Seven Seas"
[01/94] slideshow raised their international reputation, culminating in
their highlight year of 1994, when they won at both The Gathering (with
"Sequential") and at The Party (with their oustanding "Nexus 7"). Both those
demos made instant stars of their coders, and elevated Andromeda into the
absolute upper elite of demo groups. Unfortunately, they faded into the
inactivity that so many groups do at the top, and even though new demos have
been promised several times none has seen the light of day since their
finest hour at The Party 4. The group still exists, and is not dead as such.
Fairfax nowadays work as a graphician at Funcom.
  Their internal rules are rather strict; for example members are not
allowed to do packs or do modemtrading. Also, they do not allow members
from outside Norway, much like Phenomena's policy in the old days.
PRP4 brought the news that William did NOT leave the scene, despite that it
was claimed in several mags. Size closed his board 'RAW FUSION', but DIDN'T
leave the scene, as stated in some mags (ROM7). It's a small miracle that
Archmage can draw his fantastic pictures since he, like the English
graphician Red Devil/DCS, is in fact colourblind!
  1992 - Dr.Cruz changed his handle to William around january. HeadX'
upcoming demo "Scientific Norwegian" was announced through PMC and New
Wave's diskmag "R.A.W #2" [02/92] - but would not see the light of day until
its release under the title "Sequential" [04/94] at The Gathering 94! Mr.Man
contributed music, and Mr.Hyde was interviewed in the same mag. Coder Wizax
(ex Absence, 09/91) left the scene in september. Enigma (gfx, 09/91-), Bingo
(09/91-), Madlock (music, ex Motion), Ralph (swap, 09/91-) and Prophet (new
92-) were all kicked in september.
  1995 - After the whole 'Stalin' thing and the war with Lord Helmet, Hydra
(Ole Ingarth Karlsen, leader since the beginning) finally decided enough was
enough in the early parts of 1995, and stepped down as leader of Andromeda.
The new leader is Archmage, but it doesn't seem like he is nearly as
successful as his predecessor; NOTHING has been released from Andromeda
after he took over. =(
  2000 - Nah-Kolor's new diskmag "Devotion #1" revealed in an interview with
Size that Dr.Jekyll is now working for Lucas Arts in San Francisco, and
coded parts of the game "Star Wars Episode 1" for the N64.

Norwegians Moxy (ex Offence, new late92), Lizard (ex Offence, 12/92), Duel
  (ex Motion, new 92-11/92) and Blazer (ex Motion, new 92) all left to join

  review: As usual, a very polished intro from Andromeda. It certainly
  follows their standard 'clean' style. It opens with an animation where an
  Andromeda logo sort-of 'explodes' onto the screen. It then bounces to the
  bottom of the screen, and we get a tv-box lightsourced filled vector with
  filled vector objects on the sides (puh!) in the background, and a text
  writer on top of that. Does the job it's supposed to, I guess. It was
  released to announce the joining of Duel, Blazer, Madlock, Prophet and
  The Main, and the handle changes of Archmage and William. By the way,
  the opening logo animation is stored in the file as a standard IFF ANIM,
  and can be ripped with WRip or a similar program. Approved. I draw the
  conclusion that it was released early in the year - they tell someone they
  greet they'll meet at easter, plus William's handle change news was also
  in "R.A.W #2" [02/92].

  denies to be read from anywhere but df0:. The 'demo-in-a-dos-window' part
  is faked, it's just graphics. Just try running it on a 2.0 or 3.0 machine

  review: One of the last great trackmos, this suprisingly won the
  Gathering 94 competition ahead of such demos as Cryptoburners' "Brain
  State In A Box" and Polka Brothers' "Friday at Eight". Technically
  stunning, real-world realistic routines are the order of the day from
  this two-year-in-development project. As far as I know, it was also sadly
  HeadX' final demo project.
    There's nice graphics throughout, and the three tunes by Mr.Man vary
  from average to truly moodsetting - especially his orchestral tune at the
  end and the end part of the main module. Truly great stuff! From the
  jelly letters to the infamous roller coaster part to the dying tree -
  this was indeed 'the last true ECS trackmo'. Requires 1mb total mem?

  Winner of The Party 4 demo competition!
  review: Andromeda's TP4 winner still packs a great punch. It's a hard
  production to describe, since so much of it is 'feeling' rather than
  concrete. It's still Andromeda, so it's quite polished, but still a lot
  rougher than some of their previous releases. When the opening symphonics
  turn to that hard-hitting soundtrack, it's still something of a power
  rush no matter how many times I see it... The music is timed to the
  routines, almost slave-likely so. A good hint: The first time you see it,
  turn off all the lights. You'll appreciate the difference.
    Ripping however, is not so easy. The file itself is uncrunched - at
  least the header - so loading straight into a ripper doesn't help much.
  Running it with Exotic in the background, and then exiting and searching
  helped some. Exotic found a P50/P60 module with external samples that
  looked correct, but since exotic doesn't support external samples unless
  it's in the registered version, that's not much help.

Angels were a legendary cracking group, born in june 1990, and one of the
first two-faced crews, who not only cracked a lot of games, but released a
few good demos as well. They were based in France. Though they were
initially illegal-based, they grew a strong demo section when they swallowed
the French demo group Dragons 09/90. Shortly after joining they delivered
the very strong "Copper Master" (10/90) demo, but their stay unfortunately
proved to be short. Soon after its release, Corsair (code), Foxy (gfx) and
Mr.Video (gfx) announced they would move on to join Classic (please note
that this MAY be wrong, and that they infact went to The Company instead;
some research indicates it).
  1990 - Dave and Akimbo were kicked late 90.

  review: The copper master himself, Corsair, tries to do every copper trick
  ever devised...and pulls it off. Corsair made a crackintro for Angels that
  looks a lot like this demo... A great little demo this, actually, which
  clearly succeeds in what it sets out to do...to kill the raster-only dead
  by doing EVERYTHING! Still, the big star of this show is Moby's amazing
  tune... Cool and colorful is the only way to describe Copper Master!
  This is a classic, and there is no excuse for not having seen it.

  review: Competently coded in every respect, with nice design and quite a
  few good-looking effects. Just some of the things we get to see is
  rubberglenz, fractal leaf, hiddenline vector with vectorballs inside, a
  dotcube and a full-screen dot-tunnel to round it all off. There appears
  to be no exit. ADLs test mentioned some problems with a 2.04
  configuration, but since it runs on my machine, I do not think that the
  KS was their problem. Anyway, nicely designed! A few months later, in
  december, Ninja was in Paradox and released his next intro, "Calimero".

Anthrox was an English illegal group, born as early as 1989 (though they
were announced as a new group in Zine #5, released 06/90). The Amiga section
was decleared dead in 1994. However, they remain active on other platforms,
and their web site is still at the adress on top of this entry! They were
also active on the SNES scene.
  Founded in 1989 by Hydro and Count Zero, ATX has always been an illegal
group, releasing a fair few cracks and trainers in their time.
I briefly visited their website recently, and they now seem to have taken
pretty much the same path as Fairlight; selling console copiers legally.
  Despite information to the effect in RAW4, Autopsy and Angeldawn/Scoopex
did NOT join Anthrox; they both joined The Silents. Check out the info on
the board 'HYPERSPACE' for total confusion!
  1992 - Joker joined Cytax early 92.

Basline joined Desire.
The board 'PLEASURE PARADISE' was closed.
Finnish musician Daddy Freddy (ex Spirit) joined Alcatraz.

Australian coder and trainer Ice (cosysop 'SPEED BOX', ex Punishers), who
  was once dubbed 'the trainer god', and did over 200 trainers on the

  like that. The logo is the same as in the Spread Intro, btw, and apart
  from that there's a sinescroller over the plasmathing in the middle of
  the screen and a small textplotter under the logo at the top. Nothing
  awesome, but ok for what it is.

  1996 - Death (gfx) was kicked 06/96. Norwegian swapper and sysop Wiseguy
('OUTER SPACE', new early96-05/97) left 12/96. Ehrm....
  1997 - Polish Robak (old handle Korball, doublememb Amnesty) left the
scene late 97. Norwegian graphician Psycho (08/97) left late 97 for
Instinct. Coder, raytracer and swapper Hyper (new 12/96-08/97) left.
  1998 - Polish swapper Kismat (08/97) was kicked early 98.
  2000 - Early in the year, Zito (editor) left for Darkage, while Axl
(sysop) and Wizzball (Michael Phipps, code, 97-) was asked to leave.
  2001 - Norwegian swapper Punisher (new early98) joined Darkage as his
second group early in the year, only to leave both again for Gods just a
small while later. Strife is the new main organizer. Two more departures
followed, as Voicer left for Nah Kolor and Stilgar left to be in Deputy.
Their demo "Wormhole" was released at Mekka Symposium in april, and on the
credits list we could read that some people were not members anymore. This
concerns: Trump (nor code music, doublememb EMS Design [details], new
12/96-08/97) and Marl (gfx).

  5th in The Gathering 96 40k intro competition.
  review: This pretty much sucks. It's just a text writer (topaz 8!) and a
  small one-plane APT logo. The music is an external file. When I looked at
  the file it soon became evident that it was written with Blitz Basic.
  Avoidness advised.

  review: This actually looked pretty promising...until I booted it. It
  quickly becomes apparent that these guys need to rethink how they
  prioritize grahics in their productions, cause this stinks. It's got no
  STYLE, no edge, no excitement. Simply dreadful; not even the music by two
  of Syndrome's musicians is any good. It was obviously designed to run
  from floppy. Keep trying, though. I don't want to discourage you Apathy
  guys - I always try to give fair, constructive criticism. Next time, try
  going for a design that's a little more 'clear'. Perhaps it's just me,
  but I dislike the 'fuzzy' look your graphics have. Practice makes
  perfect, so try again!

  review: Though nicely presented, this demo features _OLD_ effects - I'll
  be kind and assume they are doing the 'retro thing' here... This features
  some OK design, especially in the opening moments, but those effects...
  for the record, we're talking tech-tech, linevectors, filled vectors...
  Another thing is that they've used Lazur's "Prszystan" picture from 1994,
  and I really seriously doubt they had permission from the author to do
  that...

  Apathy (part 2).
  Released for the Mekka Symposium 2001 demo competition.
  review: I left "Wormhole" with a smile, since after all it's a nice little
  production... The problem I have with this is that they somehow fail to
  rise above their 'averageness'. Let me try to explain: This is a two-part
  demo, opening with the biggest of the two. It's a story-demo, of sorts,
  where aliens come down to earth and we stand defenseless because of the
  relative lack of innovation the earth has seen compared to the aliens.
  This story is related mostly through a series of pictures by Tentacle and
  Angeldust, all of which are of good quality. We're not talking Danny-stuff
  here, but quite acceptable. The music is timed to the text that appears
  onscreen, and the overall impression is good, if not excellent. The font
  is unimaginative, and a few other details make this seem less-than-state-
  of-the-art. The only real effects apart from the graphics are a few tunnel
  effects (the "wormholes" of the title). After this part has concluded, we
  are treated to a small 'endpart' of sorts, where they further continue
  their plea for evolution =] Not much to say about this one, unusual music,
  though.
    No system requirements appear anywhere, so apart from the obvious it's
  anybody's guess how much processor power and ram this requires.

Apex [old]
----------
Apex was a German group, and presumably had nothing to do with the 'other'
group with the same name that later appeared in France.
  1990 - German swapper Terminator-X left the group to join System 5 around
july. Damien joined Beta 5 [no entry]. German swapper Mr.Turnip left for
Prophecy late.

Apex' main 'claim to fame' is probably having housed some of the people who
would later become the great French team Syndrome. They presumably had
nothing to do with the earlier German group of the same name.

Coder and keyfilemaker-maker Sunbeam (06-10/96) left for Shelter between 10
  and 11/96.

Appendix is one of the better Polish demo groups. Anything dated 07/97 is
from a newsfile by Madbart, which also included a memberlist and a
production list :D Polish music group Pic Saint Loup is a subgroup of
Appendix; severing as their music division. I'd really love to tie up all
the loose ends above, so if anyone can help...
  1995 - German musician Cie joined Phuture 303 late 95.
  1996 - Mental and Shadow (polish gfx) were both kicked in june. Blaze
joined Floppy late 96...but later returned.
  1997 - Informer, Flapjack, Cooper, FML, Carson and Rappid joined from
Erotic Design early in the year. Aln joined from Picco, and swede Scout from
C-Lous in july.
  1998 - Sundance (gfx^ascii, 07/97) was kicked due to several reasons, and
Jacobs (07/97) and Ziutek (doublememb Royal, new 07/97) both left the modem
scene in january.
  1999 - The group arranged the party Satellite 2 in november, and not long
after polish Kierownik joined the group.
  2000 - Enter and Bta (coders) were kicked... but it's possible this
happened in 2001, I'm not sure.
  2001 - Early in the year, Noxis (code) joined, Maq (code) was kicked, and
Lothar left the group. Emers (code) was recruited.

Klaf (swap pack 'Fa!', doublememb Scalaris, ex Depth, new 06/96) joined Old
  Bulls 06/96...or just as a doublemember (Showtime #2). Which is true? And
  what happened to his doublemembership in Scalaris? It is mentioned in a
  newsfile by Madbart, however, that he left both Appendix and the scene.

  review: When it starts you think 'that's a fast, but oh so small
  envmapped phong torus'. Then it grows... The routine is fast (at least
  in the first, uncomplicated parts), I'll give it that, but it's hardly
  the fastest or even the best ever. This and the fact that it (and
  variations on it) are the only routine in the intro makes it a bit
  limited for my taste. The music's OK, a lot better than most in this kind
  of thing. The graphics are functional, but not GOOD.

  review: Nice visuals help "Useless" a lot, even though there's only two
  effects in this 4k'er. The first effect is a nicelooking tunnel. It's
  hard to describe, but we travel into the tunnel, then out again. The
  second effect is a variation on the flame theme, with fires shooting out
  from a circular sun. Not bad! Then the show finishes with a reprise of
  the tunnel effect, only with a new palette, and the show's over.
  A good 4k'er.

  review: Not a bad intro at all, I was actually very very surprised that I
  was able to run it! You see, the text files that come with it claim it
  requires an FPU, though the intro ran fine without it on my machine!
  Effectwise, there's nothing new here. The phong feels relatively smooth
  and fast, but then the objects here are far from advanced. Above average.
    This intro was distributed to aminet with two versions of the
  executable; one which was the 64k compo version, and one which is
  slightly bigger, because of better textures. Music is fine. Fastram
  required is less than 4MB, but the exact amount is uncertain.

  happened to "Thing" as a consequence of this, what's certain is that Magic
  started to work for Mirage's "Chit-Chat" instead...

  review: The tune makes this little intro, but let's face it: This is not
  going to set the world on fire - and was certainly never meant to. It's
  just a text plotter, a small vector 'thingy' flying around and some
  functional background graphics. For the record, the 'PARADOXUM' bbs is
  not an Arise board, it's in Diamonds & Rust.

  review: Melee is a charming little intro, which is a little bit ruined
  for me by some truly pathetic music. Too bad they couldn't have used
  another tune... But apart from the music, this is a nice intro with some
  nice design and ok effects.
    No release date is quoted in the intro, and the only hints we're given
  is the '1993' in the accompanying ansi, and the module's sampletext
  saying the tune was made in october 93. This intro welcomes Effendi from
  Agnostic Front.

Who ARE these guys? They came out of nowhere to coorganize the
SILIConvention and code the absolutely smashing invitation intro!

German coder Axis (Michael Hillebrandt, ex Oxyron), responsible for the
  great "SILIConvention 97 Invitation" [97] and the "Fear Factory" [03/97]
  demo, decided to leave.

· SILIConvention 97 Invitation (1997, AGA File).
  code: Axis, gfx: Gizmo & Red/Icebird (main), Yazoo (font), music:
  Tommy/Avena (The Player 6.1A format).
  review: This ROCKS! I guess the cool music contributes a great deal to
  the superior atmosphere in this intro, but the coding and graphics will
  have to take their part of the 'blame' too :) It opens with two pictures;
  the first is a SILIConvention logo (rendered?) and the second is of a
  multitude of heads. It's more the way they're faded onto the screen to
  the beat of the music that appeals to me, I guess, but it's a great
  introduction either way. Then we get to the main part, which has a very
  cool effect that remains under the information at all times. It's a
  texturemapped vector cube that sort of 'surfs' the surface underneath,
  and the surface behaves like water, creating beautiful ripples all over
  the place. You'll know what I mean when you see it... Overlaid over this
  cool effect is the info file (the same as the normal text file), and it
  can be scrolled up or down by moving the mouse.
    Through sheer simplicity, power and style this is one of the best
  invitation intros I've seen in a very long time! Very very cool.
  By the way, you won't find a listing for Tommy/Avena anywhere in Scenery,
  because Avena is an Atari group...

  review: I see nothing of the exceptional qualities offered by their
  previous production in this demo. There are signs of good coding, and
  signs of some innovative effort, but the overall impression is not one
  of professionality. The music quickly gets on your nerves, as does the
  less than great graphics. A disappointment.

  code: Kalsu, gfx: Kalsu, Thain/Sensible (raytrace), Iodine (objects),

  9th in The Assembly 96 demo competition.
  review: Very reasonable for a first demo! The coder, Kalsu, proves be a
  little of a Jack of all Trades, what with providing graphics and music to
  this demo as well as coding it. It opens with an envmapped object of the
  AP symbol, a stick-man. Then we're shown an AP logo, before we're on to a
  very nice voxel routine...and then it goes underwater! I was blown away,
  sitting there with my mouth wide open. The routine looked good and fast
  in its own right, and then it actually IMPROVES on the voxel routine!
  My favorite voxel was always the one Stellar used in their 40k intro
  "Peverly Hills" (1994). It seems there is a new king in town.
  Astonishing. After that minor shock we're on to a bumpmapping routine,
  where the word Clicès is highlighted by first one, then two light
  sources. Next there's a tunnel with some greetings flying down it, before
  a scanned picture of a femal model zooms onto the screen. It stays there
  for a few seconds, before it zooms back and starts zoomrotating with a
  whole bunch of other pictures of models. Then, the innovation strikes
  back. The zoomrotator starts waving the pictures in a way I haven't seen
  before...before I actually see it forming some words! This is something
  I've never seen before - a first! The next effect can perhaps best be
  described as a 'flame tunnel', before it ends with a traditional
  upscroller over a raytraced picture with an AP logo.
    What strikes me about Clicès is that there's actually some signs of
  innovation here! That voxel routine particularly stands out. The routines
  all look good and fast. I'm willing to bet that if this was released by a
  better known group it would have been placed higher in the competition.
  I'm certainly eagerly avaiting the next AP demo. Keep up the good work!
  Probably needs some fast.

-------------------------------------------------------
GER> Argon (code, 04/96), Cockroach (code, ex DCS, new 11/94), Cougar
     (Christian Reismuller, gfx, new 04/96- 01/97), Jive (ex Platin, new
     11/94), SMT (Sascha Michael Theel, music, ex Haujobb, 12/95-07/96), The

     DCS, new 11/94).
SWE> Confidence (code, doublememb Balance [details]).
FRA> Nitch (Collomb Cedrick, code, ex Virtual Dreams, new late96).

Artwork was formed in November of 1994, when "Generation" editor
Damion/Platin took his mag with him and formed the group with Voyage/DCS.
Within days Cockroach and JMS joined from DCS, and The Loop, Jive and
Detector from Platin. Soon after this, wellknown talent like Tron, Fiver and
Noogman joined, and the world started to take notice. With their very first
production, "Greenday" (95), they WON the competition at the Black Box
Symposium 95 - and "Greenday" was awarded the DEMO OF THE YEAR accolade by
this very publication! The end of the year was also fruitful, with Azure
winning BOTH the 4k and 40k competitions at The Party!
  1995 - Towards the end of the year, German musician SMT was recruited from
Haujobb.
  In 1996, they continued recruiting talented members such as the legendary
ex-Sanity graphician Cougar, who first joined as a double member. They went
from strength to strength, and won AGAIN at the Symposium 96 with their
awesome "The Gate" demo - and Azure took home the trophy for best 40k intro
at the same party with "Dawn.Remix". Azure's next intro, the amazing "Phi"
only managed to come 2nd at the South Sealand party, but was awarded the
INTRO OF THE YEAR trophy by us - Artwork's second trophy!
  After being reinforced in the middle of 96 by ex-Matrix (amiga and pc)
members Skyphos, Sharon and Nero, they released their first and last PC
production at Assembly '96, "Proton" [08/96].
  To this day Azure retains his membership in Bizarre Arts - perhaps to show
they still have a sense of humour? Voyage used to be sysop of the board
'POINT BREAK'/'WATERWORLD' which has now been closed. Though Damion was
originally the editor of "Generation", the job has now been handed down to
RokDaZone. Though The Loop joined from Platin 11/94, I seem to have him
joining from Gods in 96. One explanation may be that he joined Gods, only to
later rejoin... German graphician jMS (ex DCS, 08/96) got kicked late in the
year, and subsequently left the scene... German coder Axis (02/96) left to
form a group of his own late 96.
  1997 - April saw the release of Generation #24, where the announcement was
made that german coder Detector (Holger Luemkemann) had left the scene.
Joining from Platin as early as 11/94, his code was behind that very mag -
and remained used for subsequent issues even though the coder himself was no
longer a part of the group. The German ex-members of Matrix who joined the
group in 1996; graphician Nero (Rainer Mühr), coder Sharon (Oliver Belaifa)
and coder-musician Skyphos (Marco Thrusch) all decided to leave Artwork late
97, and restart their old group Matrix on the PC.
  1998 - After releasing their final demo "Megademo IV 2" [04/98] at the
Mekka Symposium 98, they ended the existence of one of the most successful
groups in scene history. But out of the ashes another great German group
rises; Endzeit; founded on the remains of Artwork in much the same way that
Lemon. was founded on the ashes of Anarchy in 1993. But not all members went
to the new group ofcourse. The people behind Generation; Damion and
RokDaZone (ex Infect) formed Endzeit, and took graphician Noogman with them.
Also Italian writer The Ripper (ex Da Press, new 06/96) went alsong to
Endzeit, to continue his work for "Generation". Musician Virgill (04/95-)
joined Haujobb. Famous coder Azure (Tim Boeschke, doublememb Bizarre Arts,
11/95-) left the scene. The further scene careers of Tron (Bastian Zuehlke,
code, ex Sanity, new 01/95-) and Fiver2 (Thomas Mahlke, gfx, ex TRSI,
12/95-) remains uncertain.

Swedish coder Scout (doublememb C-Lous [details], new late96) left the
  group late 97 or early 98 to join The Black Lotus - and become a scene-
  inactive game coder!
Lenny Dee joined briefly from Illusion, only to leave the scene a few days
  later.

  code: Tron, Crash/Polka Brothers, gfx: Fiver/TRSI, Noogman (logo), music:
  "Final Amelotatism" by Virgill.
  Winner of the Black Box Symposium 95 demo competition!
  review: DEMO OF THE YEAR, and a hell of show from the Germans in their
  first ever production...amazing! Lots of goodlooking effects are on
  offer, and this time that means phong-shaded toruses, a texturemapped
  cube combined with a stretching zoomrotator (and then the zoom-rotator's
  also mapped on two sides of the cube!!), voxel landscape, and a spacecut
  texture mapped cube. The tune is not quite up to Virgill's best,
  especially the jazz shit that accompanies the voxels are out of place.
  However, an AMAZING picture by Fiver almost makes up for the shortcomings
  the soundtrack has in places. The picture is called "Green Trash", it
  depicts a human wrapped in black plastic, and came 2nd in the graphics
  competition at the same party!
    Please note that I tested an incomplete distribution, and that there's
  even more to this demo than what I've outlined! Artwork was back one year
  later, and won the Symposium compo for the second time in a row with
  "The Gate". Please read the excellent 'making of' article in ROM4.
  According to this article, the demo does NOT require a HD, but can be
  run from floppy - my butchered distribution didn't give an indication of
  this! I'd be VERY happy to receive a proper distribution.

  Cooperation with Polka Brothers.
  review: This is one impressive intro! There are lots of great-looking
  phong shaded objects on offer here, and most are a little more
  imaginative than the standard donut variety. Several also offer extras,
  like an 'afterburner' effect and transparency. Around the middle of the
  intro there's a full-screen picture (2x2). This picture is a redrawing of
  the album cover for Mercyful Fate's "Don't Break The Oath" album. The pic
  is then waved, like a flag in the wind. The next new routine is the most
  impressive one, though. We're talking about a high resolution texture
  mapped phong-shaded elastic donut that looks FABULOUS! The show is
  finished off with an effect that's a little hard to describe, but I
  think transparent phong pulse explosions is about as close as you get.
  The music is excellent throughout.

  review: After this there can be no doubt - Chaos is dead, long live
  Azure and Tron. Artwork won the Symposium for the second year in a row
  with this demo - brimming with good-looking, advanced effects! It opens
  with an interpolated voxel landscape with the credits overlayed, and the
  powerful opening tune which creates a great 'heavy demo' atmosphere.
  There's a lot of bumpmapping effects in this demo, from a lightsourced
  zooming bumped tunnel to a lightsourced bumped cube. There's also a
  graphicszoomer that's quite similar to the one TBL later used in their
  Gathering'97 winning demo "Captured Dreams". There's also some different
  mapping stuff, with the metal-env-mapped (?) head and the cube with the
  protrouding face the highlights. Need I go on? The music is great, the
  graphics are great, and it's quite simply a BIG demo - in every sense of
  the word. Download NOW!
    The endtune, "Opium" by Virgill, competed in the music competition at

  Winner of Symposium 96 40k intro competiton!
  review: Certainly technically impressive, this remix of the originally 4k
  intro "Dawn" [12/95] is very very good. This time around, the shapes are
  env-mapped and sometimes afterburned, like in Creep. The music is cool
  also, and suits the intro beautifully. I like this, small as it is. The
  reason there's no entry for graphician above is that this intro contains
  no graphics. Included in the archive is a 1x1 version of the original 4k
  intro.

  2nd in the South Sealand Party 96 intro competition.
  review: Phi, the best intro of 1996, opens with a sign of some sort and a
  progress bar at the bottom of the screen. When the progress bar reaches
  its end, the show starts...and what a show! To fabulous trancy music by
  SMT (one of his best tunes EVER) we're treated to one of the best intros
  since Virtual Dreams won at The Party 93 with "Chaosland" [12/93]!
    Azure and Tron have managed to squeeze more demo power out of 64k here
  than most people are able to in megs! With a couple of pictures thrown
  in, I'd vote this among the best DEMOS of 1996, for crying out loud!
  The intro features some of the fastest envmapping I've ever seen on the
  Amiga, and then some! There's also morphing objects, a fabulous bump-
  mapping-cum-plasma routine, and some voxelspace stuff that's quite cool.
  The intro ends with a sole image of a bleeding heart. Pretty much the same
  intro can be seen in Bizarre Arts' "Fresh!" [06/97] (by Azure and Axis)
  released just one week later! :)
    The accompanying text file mentions it uses ALL of the 4mb fast it
  requires, so if you (like me) use 512k of your fast to softkick kickstart,
  you probably won't be able to run Phi on a 4mb fast only setup. Believe
  me, I've tried :)

  Night At The Bar" by Virgill/Essence and Artwork, editor: RokDaZone.
  review: It opens nicely, with Spiv's "Casual Insane" picture from The
  Party 96 (70th!) graphics competition - not half bad. It shows what I
  guess must be the open, staring eyes of some alien child... Unusual and
  nicely executed, Spiv! The panel by Cougar is also a feast for the eyes,
  so graphically there's not much wrong with Generation. This issue has two
  modules from wellknown scene VIS, but none of them are outstanding in any
  way... I guess this comes down to taste, but I feel these two can do a lot
  better than this!
    One thing that bugs me a little is the sometime dark palette choices
  for some of the articles. It's a far cry from the light, happy colors of
  ROM! I guess I'm just not used to reading on a black background...
  Another thing that irritates me slightly is that the text does not
  scroll, like it has in most other good magazines since about...oh, 1992?
  I suppose it's a small complaint, but it's got a lot to do with the way
  the magazine 'feels' like to handle. Thankfully, it multitasks just as
  happily as ROM does, making things like writing this review a doodle :).
    Contentwise, there's a lot of stuff from The Party 6 this time, as can
  be expected. I also found the article from the Atari show interesting, as
  it's not the kind of thing you usually find in an Amiga diskmagazine.
  Overall, though, the writing here is of a disappointing quality. I guess
  we've all been spoilt rotten by ROM - the diskmag standard to which all
  others are held. With some polishing, a LOT better layour for the
  articles and a brigther display, Generation could be a winner...

  2nd in The Gathering 97 demo competition.
  review: EPD opens with an innovative opening part where (presumably) the
  coders of the demo are part of the 3d scenes. It's real hard to describe,
  but it sets just the right mood! Then the music changes, and we move into
  space... next is a phong object over a moving background,  then a
  spaceship crashes through a wall, and strange pipes twist and turn... EPD
  is a world of wonder, with lots of strange things going on... Then a quick
  trip through a tunnel before another phongobjects, this time with some
  other, smaller objects flying around... Then a falling, colorful object,
  some bump and envmapping on a couple of new objects... Then - abd this is
  cool - the entire screen starts twisting around the last object! Next is a
  massive, colorful and fast 3d scene with a humanoid shape in the middle.
  Another object follows, before 5R2's fullscreen pic "Earthpeople", winner
  at SILICONvention 97 that same weekend. Next is a weird sort of bumpmap
  effect I really don't know what to calll... :) Some more sparkly objects
  follow, before a new, bumpmapped tunnel. Next is a fullscreen raytraced
  pic with a red hand stretching towards the user, then some star objects
  appear at the same time, before three brief objects signify EXIT - PLANET
  - DUST and it's all over. Technically oustanding, with generally very good
  music, there was no doubt about who would win 2nd prize at The Gathering.
  This is a very very good demo, no question, but... it's simply just not
  "Captured Dreams" =) The version reviewed is the compoversion, which is
  missing the endpart (Virgill's module exists only in the final version,
  with endpart) which was omitted at TG because of the organizers' imposed
  space limit of 5MB. This is (for some reason) widely regarded as a
  cooperation with C-Lous, but in actuality Scout was already a full Artwork
  member at the time. His entire contribution to the demo however was just
  one tunnel routine.
    The demo requires an 030-50, but recommends at least 040-40 or 060.

  Winner of the Mekka Symposium 97 demo competition!
  review: Unfortunately, after seeing this demo - which is above average,
  don't get me wrong - I experience a feeling of disappointment. I had just
  seen the third-placer demo "Thug Life" by Essence, and was thinking 'any
  demo that can beat this is worth watching'. The problem is perhaps more in
  the fact that Azure has made SO MANY demos like this - it's got his
  fingerprints all over it. Azure is one of the best - if not THE best -
  coders out there, and he's technnically brilliant. However, he does not
  have that much ORIGINALITY in him, and when he releases two demos so close
  together, it is perhaps inevitable that they will resemble each other.
  This is a technically excellent demo, but doesn't EXCITE me. After seeing
  the demo, I'm afraid I must conclude that Artwork won this competition as
  much on name as they did on content. Azure told me (via email) that after
  seeing the competition he imagined it'd end up third. The entire demo was
  put together from "Exit Planet Dust" leftovers in the two days after it
  competed at The Gathering, which goes a long way to explain why it is what
  it is.
    "MIV" marks Artworks fourth consecutive victory at the Symposium, which
  certainly means they've earned themselves a place in the history books.
  It's just sad that the demo that does it is their weakest so far. The demo
  has been tested on 8MB fast machines only, but the text file mentions that
  it may work on 4MB machines too - it's just never been tested. 030-50
  recommended for maximum pleasure.

  review: No less than two title pictures open the show this time - another
  surrealistic masterpiece by Nero opens the ball, followed by a cartoon-
  like rendition by Geist - whose technique here reminds me of some of the
  classics from Bustman/Crusaders, that 'blocky' but still smooth look =)
  The mag itself has the familiar design from Cougar, nothing has changed
  here. Two reasonable pieces of music offer audial delight. This issue was
  released just after the two major easter-parties of the year, The
  Gathering and Mekka Symposium, and contains ample coverage of both.
    Nero's title picture is a rendition of "Boheme 29", his 8th-placed
  picture from Mekka Symposium 97, with the added text "Original by Jamiri"
  in the top left corner, and a Generation logo in the bottom left. This
  issue also announced the leaving of Detector, long-time "Generation"
  coder. The mag would continue without him - but still with his old code...

Syntex, and have removed them from the memberlist to reflect this.
  1992 - Norwegian musician and swapper Gang Starr changed his handle to
Sonic, and joined Awe in july.

The new Atomic was formed by Dolphin/Stone Arts and Colorbird/ex Razor 1911
new after Stone Arts fell apart. Their intention was to release a new
diskmag, based on the best of "Headline" (dolphin) and "Propaganda"
(colorbird), but this project newer saw fruit, and the group slowly died
away without a single release... I have therefore speculated in a 1996 death
date, hope some of the members can step forward and tell me if this is a
faulty assumption.

Aurora was a demo group based in sweden, perhaps best remembered for their
sadly underrated but great musician Dreamweaver.
  1991 - With the release of the demo "Illusions" [12/91] in december,
several new members were announced: Deejay, Trinity, Rocket (all ex
Hypnosis), Trodac (ex AFL), Dodger and Ragman.
  1992 - A lot of the group's time was put into development of their game
"Tomtespelet" (The Santa Claus Game) early this year, which they were hoping
to finish sometime in the spring. Swedish Dexter joined from Alpha Flight
with his board 'TOTAL DISASTER' around january. An upcoming music disk with
music by Dreamweaver, Dee Jay and Horace Wimp was announced for release
'soon' in PMC and New Wave's diskmag "R.A.W #2" [02/92], but was never
finished as far as we are aware. Zcandaler reopened his board in september.
At The Party in december, the groups final demo "Lost In Denmark" [12/92]
was released to a disappointing 11th position in the demo competition.
  1993 - Swedish coders Spirou and Cuddley (both new 09/92) joined The

· Invincibility #1 Packemenu (1992, 29.03, ECS Packmenu).
  code: Mr.Z, gfx: Citizen, music: "Grimstad by Night" by The Strangler (4ch
  MOD format).
  review: Ok, first of all: the raster bars were not coded by Mr.Z!!
  The routine was coded by Nosferatu/Razor 1911, and published in a
  Norwegian computer magazine! I remember typing it in myself, to see the
  effect, and I remember the text string that was embedded (in hex, so you
  wouldn't see it when you typed it in, only in memory). Therefore; using
  other people's routines and claiming they are your own is LAME! Avoid.

Axis [old] (-1992)
------------------
HOL> Danny (gfx, later TBL, 04/92).
???> Fresh (gfx, old handle Roxis).

The original incarnation of Axis was once the best group on the Dutch scene,
until it fell apart. They received a reorganization in late 91, but it
wasn't enough to save the group and it died in early to late 1992. Most
members formed a new group called Freestyle. Two years later, Axis was
reborn.
  1991 - Dartagnan changed his handle to Mop and joined Coma mid 91.
Ofcourse, Mop would rise to the top of the diskmag pile - first with
"McDisk" in Coma and later Alcatraz, then with one issue of "Compass" for
Alcatraz, before taking on the helm of today's best magazine; Essence's
"R.O.M". Dutchmen Claxon, Steroid and Magician Lord joined Desire at the
Prime 91 [12/91] party, but only stayed for a few hours. Claxon and Steroid
rejoined Axis, while Magician Lord opted to stay independent. Later, after
Axis died, they all joined the new group Freestyle!
  1992 - Liberator left Axis, and probably the scene due to lack of time
early92. However, he was back in the reborn Axis two years later! Dutch
swapper Kr'33 (ex Sanctuary) joined Sanity with his famous pack 'Femur
Bundle' 09/92. When Axis finally died, coder Crackerjack (ex Vision, 07/91)
joined  Mirage, and the rest of the old members formed a new group called
Freestyle.

Mace was kicked out.
King Dragon, Xotic, Double Dutch and Antibody got kicked.

Axis was reborn in 1994 by members from a.o. Movement. They seem to be on
the descent now that some of their best and most famous members having
left them (Rodney, Hollywood, Iso).
  1995 - Swedish graphician Rodney joined TBL late in the year. At the party
in december, the group entered with productions for both the intro and demo
competitions. The 40k intro "Headcase" [12/95] (stelios/lowlife/hollywood
with a little help from facet/tbl) came 2nd in the competition, while the
demo "Parakrishna" [12/95] (celtic/eros/timeless) fared much worse, and
ended up at an abysmal 18th place in its competition =(
  1996 - Female swapper Clary left in april, and is now only in Drifters.
Dutch musician Iso (Christiaan Unck, 12/94) left late in the year. English
musician Hollywood (ex Melody, double Desire, 12/95) and coder Stelios
(12/95) both left to form their own group late in the year, called Vacuum.

  review: Minimal but mighty. There are some mean shaded toruses here -

  there's some motionblurred cubes and a colorexplosion effect - and the
  whole thing's just 31k. Not bad at all!

Axxis (-1989)

german sections) left to join Brainstorm.


Azkiness (AZK)
--------------
POL> Draw (ascii swap, doublememb Ambrosia [details], late96).

Azkiness is a group we know not much about, but judging from the name we
guess it's a fair assumption that this is an ascii group =)
