What is Scenery? Well, it's a guide to groups, parties and releases on the
c64/amiga demoscene (pc is in development), and features what is likely the
biggest, best and most comprehensive scene party index ever made public.
It's an attempt to cover an important part of digital history, to accurately
document things and events that otherwise might be forgotten. The demoscene
has given me immense entertainment and excitement over the years, and this
is my way of giving something back.

The Scenery project was initiated by glenn in 1996, but not released to the
public until the year 2000, thanks to an initiative from Buzz, webmaster at
Exotica (http://exotica.fix.no). Scenery was originally a one-man project,
but since going public and online, a large number of people have helped out
with everything from small snippets of information to entire sections of
party results etc. Many people have contributed a little, and a few have
contributed a lot. Special 'thank you's for your tireless efforts to Buzz,
Zeg and Phoenix.

As of april of 2001 we are also going public with the c64 side of the
project, scenery64. This has been in partial development since 1998, but was
not deemed releaseable until now. The party archive is shared between the
two, and now also reflects 'demo of the year' and 'significant releases' for
the c64. If some of these fields seem conspicuously empty yet, then rest
assured I'm working on the matter. They'll be filled when I decide exactly
who and what deserves to fill them ;]

On an amusing sidenote, I have *NEVER* received complaints about my
selections for demo/intro of the year, so I guess most of us agree on these
things...

Please be advised that all reviews and opinions voiced in Scenery are just
that - my personal opinions - and not the gospel truth. If I write a
negative review of your demo, always keep in mind that it's just one
person's opinion. I am NOT trying to discourage anyone from continuing to
write material for the demoscene! Keep trying, it's the only way to succeed.

Scenery is freeware. Use this material in any way you want. Permission is
hereby granted for its distribution on internet web and ftp sites, and any
reasonably priced cd-roms. You may, if you feel really generous, donate a
copy to me =)


··· the guys

glenn (norway) has been developing scenery since 1996, originally based on
the last version of the Amiga Demo List (ADL), release 940814, by Jean-Guy
Speton, but since then everything has been rewritten and re-researched
several times over =] Since I obviously confuse some people: Glenn Lunder is
my NAME, glenn is my HANDLE. That clear now?

Buzz (uk) is our webmaster and interface designer, providing us with
webhosting at his amiga nostalgia site Exotica (http://exotica.fix.no).

Zeg (germany) edits the Amiga Demo Scene Encyclopedia (also at Exotica), and
has contributed AMAZING amounts of material for scenery.

Phoenix (usa) is a party result contributor, and has helped us correct
hundreds of mistakes in the scenery party archives!

_SoLO_ (france) is the webmaster of several great demo related sites, and
also helps me keep Scenery's weblinks updated! He is webmaster of World of
Cracktros (http://cracktros.planet-d.net), DHTML Demos (http://dhtmldemos.
planet-d.net) and the Skarla web site (http://www.multimania.com/skarlamiga)

Zito (germany) is our spreader and pr man, who takes the time to upload
and promote scenery at every important site around the net.
