demo of the year........................................................n/a
significant releases....................Smash Designs "Our Darkness" (demo)


1998 was another year of evolution for the scene, with important events like
the first demos with MP3 soundtracks (f.ex. Haujobb's "Heresy") and also
demos under windows were becoming more widespread. Euskal, Assembly and The
Party arranged separate demo competitions for dos and windows based pcs.

As the scene recovered from last year's The Party climax, not much
interesting product appeared in the first few months, until easter time came
around. The Gathering was held in Hamar, Norway, as usual. The amiga demo
competition was won by Mellow Chips/TRSI with their groundbreaking demo
"Rise" (also demo of the year), followed by Dual Crew Shining with "Nebula"
and Nukleus with "Nostalica". The amiga 64k intro competition was won by
last year's demo competition winners TBL with their comeback intro
"Imitation None", followed by Spaceballs' "Total Dominance" and Ephidrena's
"Fusion is my Energy". The unaccelerated pc demo competition was won by Gods
with "Dimension", followed by Cryonics with "Loco" and TPOLM with "TE-2RB".
The 3dfx accelerated pc demo competition was won by Complex with "Planet
Cornball". And finally, the pc 64k intro competition was won Sublogic with
"Jive 2", followed by Purple with "Photon" and Dawn 3 with "Sin (x)".

But as you all know, there is another major party held at easter time -
Mekka Symposium in Germany. That was also the case this year, and it was an
event that brough about a number of interesting releases. The amiga demo
competition was won by Haujobb with "Aphrodisiae" (my personal runner-up
demo of the year), followed by veterans Abyss with "Extra Life" and Mankind
with "Scraps of Beings". The amiga 40k intro competition was won by Scoopex
with "Superautodrome 2", followed by Haujobb with "Shibuya" and Abyss with
"Tribute - The Real OldskOOl". The pc demo competition was dominated by ex-
amiga talent, and the winners were Matrix (exmember of Artwork amiga) with
"The Fulcrum". The two runners-up were Abyss with "Startrail To Glory" and
Darkage with "Dimension". The pc 64k intro competition had a surprise
winner; none other than PSI/Future Crew with an intro named "Paul Boutique"!
He was followed by Haujobb's "Licht". The c64 demo competition was won by
Smash Designs with "Our Darkness", followed by Hitmen's "Reanim8ed" and
Crest and Oxyron's coop demo "Krestyron".

Summer Encounter 98 was held in Denmark sometime in the summer. The pc demo
competition was won by Purple with their demo "Plastik", followed by
Blasphemy with their "Lois Lane". The pc 64k intro competition was won by
Fudge with their intro "Kill The Clone".

Abduction was held in finland in june, and also brought some interesting
releases. The amiga demo competition was won by Capsule Inc. with the demo
"Phase One", followed by demos from Zenon and Nah-Kolor. The amiga 64k intro
competition was won by the cooperation intro "Soma" by Haujobb and Dual Crew
Shining. The pc demo competition was won by Doomsday Productions with
"Stigma", followed by a cooperation demo from Essex and Damage. The pc 64k
intro competition was won by PwP with "Final ISI", followed by intros from
Council 4 and Mewlers.

Remedy 98 was held in Sweden around the same time. The amiga demo
competition here was won by Tulou with "Pusherman", followed by demos from
Nature and Mystic. The amiga intro competition was won by DCS, followed by
intros from Tulou and Fiction. The pc demo competition was won by Noice with
"Destination Goatland", followed by demos from Byterapers and Outbreak. The
pc 64k intro competition was won by Woorlic with "Svedupellet", followed by
itnros from Magic and Artificial Interrupt.

Wired 98 was held in Belgium in july. The pc demo competition brought us
Cocoon and Syndrome's cooperation demo "Shad" in the winning position,
followed by demos from BlaBla and Immortals. The pc 64k intro competition
was won by Quad with "Theta", followed by intros frmo Calodox and Kolor.
The c64 demo competition was won Smash Designs with "Outbreak", followed by
demos from Warriors of Wasteland amd Draken.

August arrived, and it was time for the next major event in the demoscene:
Assembly in finland. Nerve Axis repeated last year's success and won the
amiga demo competition for the second time in a row, this time with "Relic".
It was followed by Embassy's "Delta" and Network's "Synthesis". The amiga
64k intro competition was won by Haujobb with "Edit 0.5", followed by
Scoopex' superior "System Shock" and Sonik Clique's "Red-Eye". The pc demo
competition was won by Trauma with "Gateways", followed by demos from Moppi
Productions, Pulse, Byterapers and CNCD. The pc 64k intro competition was
won by Coral with "Oxygene", followed by intros from Moottoori and Haujobb.
And finally, the prestigious c64 demo competition was won for the second
time in a row by Panic, with "Speedway 2". The two runner-up positions were
filled by Gefilus and Yleisradio.

The X98 was held in the Netherlands in september, exclusively for the c64
scene. Winner of the c64 demo competition was Booze Design with "Soul",
followed by Smash Design with "Scream" (AFAIK their only defeat this year!)
and Warriors of Wasteland with "Halfbaked".

But as with every year, releases were fewer towards the end of the year, as
most group saved their bang for the year's main event: The Party in
december. The amiga demo competition was won by Scoopex with "Alien 2",
followed by Oxyron with "Dreizehn" and Abyss with "Wildlife". The amiga 40k
intro competition was also won by Scoopex with "1000%", followed by intros
from Loonies and Abyss. The pc dos-based demo competition was won by Nomad
with "MOAI", followed by Bomb's "State of Mind" and Purple and Blasphemy's
cooperation demo "Kkowboy". The pc windows-based demo competion was won by
Gods with "Incoming Future", followed by Abyss' "Niklaus" and Madami's
"Natural Beat". The pc 64k intro competition was won by Fudge with "Alien
Sex Clone", followed by Halcyon's "Hplus" and Eufrosyne's "Transformers".
The c64 demo competition was won by Smash Designs with "Triage III",
followed by Breeze with "The Quark" and Oxyron and Crest with another coop
demo, "Coma Job 2/3". You could say it was the crowning moment of a great
year for at least Scoopex (amiga) and Smash Designs (c64) =)

-------------------
ICI98 was held in Sweden for the amiga and pc scenes. The 64k and demo
competitions were held mixed, since there were only two amiga entries for
each competition. Poison/Goto10 was disqualified from the multichannel
competition for trying to compete with a tune he had previously competed
with at The Party 6. We really need that date!! =)

10-13.04  Mekka Symposium 98 (http://ms.demo.org).
--------------------------------------------------
MS98 was held at Heidmarkhalle in Fallingbostel, between Hamburg and
Hannover in Germany by Smash Designs (c64), Lego (amiga), Phantasm (amiga),
Cubic Team $een (pc), Polka Brothers (pc) and Amable (pc). There was space
for around 1200 visitors, and about 1000 attended. The overall impression
was one of good organizing, with clean toilets and food and drinks available
around the clock. About 50 organizers took part in the party. Sleeping was
possible in a tent outside the main hall. A movie called "Virtual Vision"
about the demoscene, with a logo by Deekay and music by Jeroen Tel, was
shown! Also a band called "Maybebop" performed covers of classic tunes, like
from the c64 games Commando and Wizardry.
  Amiga compo entries were shown on an 060-based machine, but had to work on
an 030 with 8MB fastmem. As a funny anecdote, the Amiga invitation intro
actually came 7th in The Party 97 40k intro competition! :)
  Results fixed in a few places, for example the official results only lists
one of the two authors of the winning c64 picture!

25-26.04  Rush Hours 1998.
--------------------------
RH98 was held at Magnes Czestochowianka Sport Hall (Rejtana 17 street) in
Czestochowa, Poland by Freezers (amiga), Pulse (pc), Shadows (atari) and
Samar (c64). About 300 people attended. The date, as announced in the
invitation, was 18-19.04 - and it said 'won't be changed' too! The date I'm
using is 100% correct though, and confirmed from several sources. For some
strange reason, only c64 sceners were allowed to vote for c64 productions...
Prices were very low, and there seems to have been a general displeasure
with the c64 organizers, and accusations of vote faking was widespread. Some
c64 demos were disqualified due to viruses.
  This was also the party where the first ever PowerPC demo was released,
Venus Arts' remix of their classic "Everything Dies"! The second place in
the amiga demo competition, VA + MAWI's "Visible World" is not really a
demo, but a slideshow. There were 48 entries for the 4 channel competition
(9 selected), and 68 entries for the multichannel (12 selected).

---------------------------------------------------------
ABD98 was at Oulun Urheilutalo in Oulu, Finland, and this is the fifth time
Abduction is arranged. There was a 24h cafeteria. The amiga compo machine is
an A1200T with 060-50 and a CyberVision 64/3D graphics card! As usual,
Karpow/Scoopex was in charge of the Amiga section of the party. Just under
300 people attended, and 177 were registered as voters for the competitions.
The c64 demo competition was cancelled due to a lack of contributions :-(
We have intentionally left out the results of the Quake Tournament! :)

03-05.07  Scenery 98.
---------------------
SCE98 was held in Podkowa Lesna Gtowna, Poland for the atari and c64 scene!
It was a very small party, only about 50 people attended in total, of which
about 30 were on the c64. c64 competitions were organized by El Banditos/
SCS+TRC and Corwin/Fraction. Alcohol was prominent at the party, but somehow
they managed to make a few compos too =) Kordiaukis left Samar for Arise at
the party, and subsequently won the music competition!

17-19.07  Wired 98 (http://nl.scene.org/wired98).
-------------------------------------------------
WIR98 was held at Salle Polyvalente de Colfontaine in Wasmes near Mons,
Belgium by Imphobia, Melting Pot, Pulpe, W.O.W. and ROLE for the pc, amiga
and c64 scenes. This was the fifth and final time Wired was arranged. Around
800 people attended, and about 80% of those were foreigners! Only a single
amiga demo, and a single amiga intro delivered for the competitions.
Jace/TBL would have won the surprise coding competition (his entry was just
93 bytes long!), but he displayed the number in binary ;) I have omitted the
results of the Coca Cola drinking competition, hope noone minds too much :)

07-09.08  Assembly 98 (http://www.assembly98.net or www.assembly.org).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
ASM98 was held at the Helsinki Fair Center (http://www.finnexpo.fi) in
Helsinki, Finland (for the fourth time in a row). Approximately 3000 people
showed up, and the party was generally wellorganized. All compos actually
started when they were supposed to for once, save for the outdoor soccer
comp. The invitation promised all competitions would be streamed across the
web, for people not able to attend themselves!
  The results are a little weird, with lots of double and triple entries in
the graphics results... I have tried to correct them as best I could, please
tell me if I've made any mistakes! Some spelling mistakes were fixed, plus
c64 competitor's groups added in a correct way. So again, these are probably
the most complete results you're likely to find anywhere =)

28-30.08  Gravity 98.
---------------------
GRV98 was held in Turawa near Opole, Poland by Anadune and Amnesty for the
amiga and pc scenes. This was the third time gravity was arranged, and the
party is often referred to as 'Gravity 3'. 332 people attended (Nephoo
claimed over 500), much more than the organizers expected - The main hall
was calculated for 200 people, but there were several smaller rooms. The
party is often referred to as Gravity 3. This was probably the first demo
competition to feature an amiga demo based on the ppc processor.

DRH98 was held in Kupolen, Borlänge, Sweden for the amiga and pc scene.
There were some problems with the bigscreen, since the organizers didn't get
the one they were promised. The picture was too dark on the new one, and
some demos suffered from this... As you can see, our results are far from
definite, so any help is most welcome!
