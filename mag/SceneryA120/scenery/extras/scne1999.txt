demo of the year........................................................n/a
significant releases....................................................n/a


1999 saw some changes for the scene... There were a few new platforms and
formats introduced at parties for one thing: Playstation demos and MP3 music
competitions started appearing. Some pc demos had started to include MP3
soundtracks already last year, but it wasn't until now it was becoming
widespread. Windows demos were also becoming more widespread this year, and
two of the major parties (assembly and the party) introduced separate
competitions for dos and windows demos. Euskal, Assembly and The Party did
this already last year, but at that time dos contributions were more
plentiful; this year it was seemingly about 50-50.

April and the easter holidays brought the year's first two major parties;
The Gathering in Norway and Mekka Symposium in Germany. The Gathering first
- Both the amiga demo and 64k competitions were won by Spaceballs with
"Supermonster" and "Fusion Is No Good For Me". Runners-up were Ephidrena's
"Flux" and Da Jormas' "Ulsteri" in the demo competition, and Da Jormas and
Apathy in the 64k competition. The pc demo competition was won by iNF with
"Yume 2000 - (Future World Mix)", followed by The Lost Souls and Phrenetics.
Purple won the 64k intro competition with "Public Demand", followed by Kooma
and Paranoids.

Meanwhile over in Germany the Mekka Symposium party was held. The amiga demo
competition was won here by Haujobb with their great demo "Mnemonics",
followed by Skarla with "When We Ride On Our Enemies" and Ozone. The amiga
40k intro competition was won by Nature's "Grid", followed by contributions
from Depth and Black Monks. The pc demo competition was won by Smash Designs
(who won the c64 demo competition at the same party last year!) with "Event
Horizon", followed by Amable and Suburban's cooperation demo "Planet
Subotnik", and Scoopex' "Alien 2" - the pc version of their The Party amiga
winner from last year. The pc 64k intro competition was won by last year's
demo competition winners Matrix with "G-Cube", followed by entries from Dusk
and Numb. The c64 demo competition was won by Driss with "1st Demo III"
followed by demos from Faque and The Dreams.

The Arf! Party in France was held a little later in april, and also featured
some interesting releases. The pc demo competition was won by Cocoon and
Syndrome with "Shad 2", and the pc 64k intro competition by Calodox with
"Bring It Back".

Takeover 99 was held in the Netherlands in june, and also featured some
interesting entries. The pc demo competition was won by Nomad with "No
Exit", followed by The Black Lotus and Orion. The pc 64k intro competition
was won by Hellcore and Omnicolour's "Bakkslide Seven", followed by Suburban
and Aardbei. The graphics competition's top three read like a who's who of
ex-amiga graphical talent; Made/Bomb, Saffron/TBL and Nytrik/Cocoon!

Summer Encounter 99 was held in Denmark in july, and the pc demo competition
here was won by Blasphemy with "Moral Hard Candy", followed by demos from
Purple and Alien Prophets. The pc intro competition was won by Haujobb's
"Ethik", followed by VoxPod and Turbo Bazz Lovers.

Then august came along, as always with the major Assembly party in Finland.
This year the amiga demo competition was won by Loveboat with their demo
"Beats, followed by Dual Crew Shining and Mystic. The amiga 64k intro
competition was won by Da Jormas followed by Extreme, Spaceballs and Scoopex
in fourth place. The pc demo competition was split into plain dos and 3d
accelerated portions, and the dos competition was won by Recreation with
"Gasoline". Damones and Pyrotech were the runners-up. The 3d competition was
taken home by Mature Furk with "Virhe", followed by Trauma and Komplex. The
pc 64k intro competition was won by Mewlers with "Viagra" folllowed by Nah
Kolor and Reality Benders. The c64 demo competition was won by Panic with
"Speedway 3" - their third Speedway and their third consecutive win at
assembly! - followed by demos from Scallop and Visac. Pc demoscene veteran
Purple Motion (Future Crew) won the mp3 music competition.

Another interesting party held in august was the Lucky Tigrou Party 3 in
France. The pc demo competition was won Orion with "Nightfall", followed by
demos from Cocoon and Popsy Team. The oldskool demo competition was won by
Ninja/Scoopex with "Eclipse" (a500), followed by Dune (atari st) and Melting
Pot (a500). The 64k intro competition was won by Haujobb with the great
"Discloned", followed by Eclipse and Calodox. The top three in the graphics
competition were Made (big surprise...not!), Alias and Tenshu. Made also won
the oldskool graphics competition. The mp3 music competition was won by
another pc demoscene veteran, Zodiak/Cascada.

Not much interesting happened in the intervening months, as most groups were
busy gearing up for the major event of the year: The Party 99 in december.
The amiga demo competition was won by Ephidrena with "Concrete", followed by
Loveboat with "Spellbound" and a surprise comeback from The Black Lotus with
"Rain". The amiga intro competition was won by Dual Crew Shining with
"Nonstop", followed by Loveboat and Loonies. The standard pc demo
competition was won by 3 State with "Melrose Space" followed by demos from
Replay and Damager. The pc 3d demo competition was won by Elitegroup with
"Kasparov" followed by Hirmu and Astral. The pc 64k intro competition was
won by Haujobb with their strangely titled "Fukwit Daddy", followed by
Replay and Aardbei. The c64 demo competition was won by No Name with "Y2K
(Duck & Cover)", followed by Scala Productions and another demo by No Name.

20-21.03  Astrosyn 2.
---------------------
AST2 was held in Koszalin, Poland for the amiga and pc scene. Amiga entries
could be both 68k or ppc based. Foreigners wishing to participate in the
competitions did not need to be present; they could email or post their
entries. Only the music competition would need selection; everything else
will be shown on the big screen. Drinking will actually be allowed, but they
put a ban on drugs at the partyplace. This is a real sad development for the
scene, I feel, when it's necessary to write something like that...it should
be blatantly obvious. The a500 demo competition was officially cancelled
since there were only 2 contributions, but they were shown on the big
screen. rebirth-338 song competition was cancelled because of too few
entries. The only entrant was Voyager/Darklight...with four different songs!
=) They were "Darklight [mind error edit]", "Darklight [reprogrammed]",
"Brave New Mind [edit]" and "I've Found Bad Sector In My Brain". All wild
competition entries were amiga demos!!

great: "We will not have showers, guarenteed dark, quiet and soft sleeping
areas, drugs and alcohol, or anywhere near an adequate supply of coke and
chips for you."  :)

16-18.04  Arf! Party (http://arfparty.citeweb.net).
---------------------------------------------------
ARF99 was held in France for the very first time. The wild competition was
cancelled due to a lack of time. The winning demo "Shad 2" used a videomode
that the videoprojector didn't support, so the entire demo had to be
recompiled - at 5 in the morning, and live on the big screen :) This must
have been the first time that happened in scene history, right? =)
