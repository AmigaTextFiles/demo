1997 was a truly great year for the demoscene, a year that brought more
great demos than any previous year we can remember...in fact, we feel we'd
have to go as far back as 1991 to find anything even remotely similar! It
was a year of both new, exciting groups (Haujobb, Mellow Chips) and the
revitalisation of older established ones (Scoopex)!

Things were quiet in the beginning of the year, until TBL struck with a
demonstration of almost unheard of power at The Gathering; "Captured Dreams"
[03/97] is perhaps the best Amiga demo _EVER_! Artwork released no less than
two great demos that weekend, "Exit Planet Dust" at The Gathering and
"Megademo IV" at Mekka Symposium. Another great easter demo was Essence's
"Thug Life", 3rd at Mekka Symposium.

The traditional Assembly party in august was surprisingly won by the
Englishmen from Nerve Axis with their excellent "Pulse" [08/97].

At the finnish demo party Demolition III in october, TRSI's new demo
subgroup Mellow Chips gave us a taste of the things to come, in the shape of
their awesome "Dose" [10/97], only beaten by the inferior pc demo "Neon" by
Haujobb.

Just weeks before The Party, at the new Polish party Astrosyn, Venus Art
gave their farewell to the scene with what is a VERY close contender for
demo of the year, "Everything Dies" [12/97]. It's complex 3D routines gave
soul to objects for the first time, and signalled a bold leap forward in the
3D demo genre...it's just a pity that Venus Art won't be around to lead the
way further =[

The Party is always the year's climax for the demoscene, and always give us
some binary treats. This year was no different. The biggest surprise must
have been the GREAT participation in the C64 competitions - there hasn't
been this many entries in a major 64 competition since the early 90's! This
is surely some kind of trend from the hardcore sceners; they're all sick of
the commercialism that has invaded the amiga and pc scene, and all the
newcomer lamers that destroy the seal of quality. Therefore they turn back
to their roots; to a scene that's still underground. Here's one Scenery
editor that's hoping the trend continues well into the next millennium! =)
Haujobb and Scoopex took home the honors this year with their demo "My
Kingdom" [12/97].


c64 - This year was truly in the sign of the germans in Smash Designs. The
winners of three major demo parties in one single year, and also the demo of
the year award from us for their amazing "Second Reality".

28-30.03  Absolute 97.
----------------------
ABS97 was held in Lahti, Finland. Any information at all would be most
welcome!


28-31.03  Mekka Symposium 97 (http://ms.demo.org).
--------------------------------------------------
MS97 was held at Heidmarkshalle Fallingbostel near Soltau, Germany by
Polka Brothers, Lego, Phantasm (amiga), Amable (pc), Avena (atari) and
Smash Designs (c64). About 750 people visited. MS97 is a combination of
last year's Symposium (multi-platform) and Mekka (pc) parties. Not everyone
likes the idea of joining forces however, which means MS97 was competing
with the SILIConvention, a party arranged by people who previously worked
on Symposiums. Artwork won the demo competition for the THIRD year in a
row, making them historical!
  Our results are a lot more complete and correct than the official text
file, including corrected names of participants/productions and lots of
unplaced entries. See our special CD-ROM file for more information on how
to obtain the excellent MS97 CD-ROM!

· Results from 'official results from   MEKKA & SYMPOSIUM '97'.

28-31.03  SILIConvention 97 (http://www.siliconvention.com).
------------------------------------------------------------
SLC97 was held at Gemeinschaftszentrum Obervieland in Bremen, Germany by
ADM (atari), Arsenic (amiga), Blank (pc), Complex (pc), Fairlight (c64),
Icebird (acorn), Inter (atari), Plush (c64), Talent (c64) and TSCC (atari).
As you may gather from the list of arrangers, it's a party for nearly every
machine out there with a demoscene! Specifications for the intros were
different for all platforms; amiga 40k, atari 96k, atari and pc 64k!
There should be room in the hall for about 2000 people plus separate
sleeping area. One of the more novel ideas of this party was a promised
disco with only music from the c64! In addition to the WWW server, there's
also an ftp server at the same domain, ftp.siliconvention.com. The 4th
place in the 4ch music competition should read CDK, not CDR as the
official results wrote. The 2nd place C64 demo, "Plob" by Plush, was
disqualified since it was a 'double entry' - which probably means it
competed somewhere else too. There was only a single amiga demo in the
competition.

04-06.04  Scenest 97, The Third Act: Dominator.
-----------------------------------------------
SCE97 was held at Mechatronikai Szakközépiskola és Gimnázium in Budapest,
Hungary by Impulse (amiga) and AstroideA (pc). This was the third Scenest
held in three years, and this time 1050 people showed up! PC and Amiga
demos could not exceed 8mb in size, intros were 64k for both systems.
4k compos were to be held mixed. Competitions were also to be held for
the C64; demos were max size 2 disks, as well as a graphics and music.
Compomachines are to be Pentium 133/16MB, PCI S3 Trio 64V+, GUS MAX 1MB,
and for the amiga an A1200/060 with 10MB ram - 1230/50 optional.
  One nice thing about the invitation text is that they're printing the
names of the selection jurys in the text files! Hopefully this will put an
end to the endless 'they didn't pick my music because I'm not famous'
whining. They mention in the invitation text that all entries will be one
the next issues of 'Chip Magazine' and 'CD Ultra'. Does anyone know where
to find these mags?

05-06.06  Abduction 97 (http://dot.tcm.hut.fi/abduction).
---------------------------------------------------------
ABD97 was held at Oulun Urheilutalo in Oulu, Finland by Karpow/Scoopex, and
this was the fourth time ABD was arranged. Some other sources claim it was
held from the 6th to the 8th...I don't know which is right. There was no
invitation intro. Please note that Deck's music contribution (which
finished dead last) carries the same name as the Scoopex demo that WON at
The Party this year! This was also the second year in a row that Byterapers
won the PC demo competition. There was a live performance by 'Bstates'
(Dune/Orange) and 'Origami' (Yolk and Legend/CNCD)!

12-15.06  Party Remedy 97 (http://www.remedy.dcs-graphics.se).
--------------------------------------------------------------
RMD97 was held at Råsunda Skolan in Solna outside Stockholm, Sweden by Dual
Crew Shining, and this was the third time Remedy was arranged. About 300
people showed up. There was a soccer cup tournament, won by "TBL and
friends"... The graphics competition was a total disaster, after every
picture was reshown due to problems the first time they were shown. The
problem was that they were shown in a different order, and therefore were
all assigned new entry numbers, a fact which escaped many of the people in
attendance. This led to a whole heap of votes for a.o. MRK being given to a
totally different picture. Therefore, the results below are a little
misleading as far as the actual 'best' and 'worst' picture go.
  One innovation of this party was the AMiGA and PC combined Dentro
competition, which limited entries at 256k. In this editor's opinion, this
is a great idea, and one that more parties should adopt! I'm also REALLY
curious about that third-placed Wild entry by 'Danko'... Could this mean
that Tomas Danko Jr., perhaps better known as C64 musician extraordinaire
Danko/Fairlight, is still among us?

12-13.07  Intel Outside 4.
--------------------------
IO4 was held in a sports hall in Wloclawek, Poland by Union (amiga),
Cybermaniax (tech) and Taquart (atari). For the first time, IO was held
outside the capital of Warsaw, and this was also the first year that other
platforms - yes, even including the PC - was allowed to take part. In this
light, it does seem a little strange that they chose the keep their name,
but... About 700 paying visitors attended, in addition to the people who
didn't have to pay and the people who didn't want to pay... :) All in all,
about 850 people visited. All foreigners were allowed to enter for free,
and people from Russia, Germany and even scandinavia took advantage of this
offer. Although alcohol was officially prohibited at the party, arrangers
did nothing to hinder partying, and many people had a good time with beer
and good friends. A big problem arised after the party, as there due to
communication problems was never released any final results! My results are
from ROM's party report, and are probably the most complete ones available.
Amiga 4k competition was cancelled, since the daylight made viewing the
entries on the big screen impossible! Anyone with Atari, 8 bit or PC
results, could you please get in touch?

25-27.07  Euskal 97 (http://euskal.jet.es).
-------------------------------------------
EUS97 was held in San Sebastian, Spain for the fifth time. About 700 people
attended, though sadly only 150 took the time to vote for the competitions.
French visitors Ramses did a pretty clean sweep, and Goblins and Network
both failed to complete their entries for the demo competition in time for
the deadline. The Human demo competition was held instead of a traditional
Wild demo competition. A four magabyte 'movie', EUSKAL.MPG, was uploaded to
AmiNet.

Amiga  modules LIVE. More than 300 paying people attended. The AmiNet
release of the modules promised a CD-ROM release of all entries as well as

and it was followed by Abort 98 the following year. The first ever Slovenian
demos were released here.


06-07.12  Arroutada 97 (http://www.redestb.es/personal/marcos).
---------------------------------------------------------------
Held at Edificio Servicos Múltiples in El Burges, Galicia, Spain for the
amiga scene only.


13-14.12  Astrosyn 97.
----------------------
AST97 was held at Sports Hall in Koszalin, Poland by Mawi (amiga) and Spawn
(pc). 370 people payed to visit; 188 on the Amiga, 120 on the PC, and
062 others. Ofcourse, women, organizers and media must be added to this
number. The Crazy competition was held instead of the usual Wild
competitions, and was a mixed Amiga and PC event. Great trend: There were
FAR more Amiga contributions to the competitions than there were PC ones!
Most graphics and music can be found on AmiNet CD 24 demo/aga/ast_*.lha
Multichannel results completed by me; not all info was present. This was the
first time Astrosyn was arranged, a second party was held in 1999.

19-21.12  Jumper 97 (http://jumper.base.org).
---------------------------------------------
Held at Kazinczy Ferenc-Laczkó Zoltán in Devrecen, Hungary for the Amiga,
PC and C64 scene.


27-29.12  The Party 7 (http://www.theparty.dk).
-----------------------------------------------
TP97 was held at Messecenteret in Aars, Denmark. All the usual comforts were
provided, from sleeping areas to food and drinks. Powerful PA equipment,
large screen, and a laserdisc room. The results were HELL to edit from their
original HTML form; there's a lot of entries! I'd really like to know the
rest of the composers for the 4ch music competition... Interestingly, the
C64 scene seems to be ON THE RISE, with more entries now than for a long
time! There were a few more entries in the graphics competition, but as they
all receive 0 points (didn't even bother to vote for themselves :) and
didn't have author credits, I didn't care to include them.
