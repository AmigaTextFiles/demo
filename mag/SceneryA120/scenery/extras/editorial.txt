                  scenery amiga version 1.20 (august 2001)

This release of scenery amiga is concentrated mostly on re-research,
updating and rewriting some of the earliest material that was written for
the project. The myriad of friendly, helpful e-mails we have received have
also helped us correct many of our past errors, as well as helped our
motivation.

With time, I have learned more and more, and have adopted new methods of
investigation - as well as my reference library has grown immensly.
Development of scenery is now based much more on cross-reference than in the
past, and so reinvestigation of old material is sometimes necessary to
maintain quality throughout. Having said that, there is still much work to
be done on sections I am far from pleased with. But alas, the work
continues... =)



--- how to read scenery amiga ---------------------------------------------

THIS section will hopefully answer any question you may have about how to
read Scenery. It explains the various shortcodes used in the entries, and
the system we use to organize the information. Below is what any entry in
the main part of Scenery might look like:

Cool Group (CLG, http://www.coolgroup.org, 199x-199x)
-----------------------------------------------------
NOR> Cool Norwegian (code), Cool Painter (gfx), Cool Musician (music).
HOL> Cool Gfxian (gfx, ex Cool Graphics Team, new 02/97).
???> The Guy From Another Place (code gfx music ascii sysop 'BBS').

Here is where you'll find the group's history and any other significant
information. If it's a group that's been around, with some tradition, expect
me to go on endlessly and get terribly nostalgic :D
  199x - This is a summary of the year's events for the group.

· Demo Name (1997, 01.01, AGA 4MB HD Multifile Slideshow).
  code: Coder, gfx: Artist, music: Musician.
  3rd at The Party 199x intro/demo/slideshow/whatever competition.
  review: Seeing as this is just a dummy example and not a real review, I
  won't bother with writing anything remotely comprehensible here. So hrjs!
· GLE tested A1200/030-50/2mb chip, 4mb fast/3.0.

The heading perhaps needs extra explanation. The basic format is this:

  Demo Name (year, dd.mm, requirements description).

And here are some of the codes you'll encounter:

-- graphics

  ECS   The production works fine with OCS/ECS chipsets (½mb chip assumed).
  AGA   The production requires the AGA chipset (2mb chip assumed).
  CYB   The production requires/supports CyberGfx compatible 24-bit
        graphics.
  P16   The production requires/supports Picasso 16 compatible 24-bit
        graphics.
  020   The production requires a 68020 or higher processor. With AGA
        productions, this is a given, so this coded will only appear on
        OCS/ECS productions.
  030   The production requires a 68030 or higher processor.
  040   The production requires a 68040 or higher processor.
  060   The production requires a 68060 or higher processor.
  PPC   The production requires a PowerPC processor.

-- memory

  ½MB   The production requires ½MB fast ram.
  1MB   The production requires 1MB fast ram.
  2MB   The production requires 2MB fast ram.
  4MB   The production requires 4MB fast ram.
  8MB   The production requires 8MB fast ram.
  16MB  The production requires 16MB fast ram.
  32MB  The production requires 32MB fast ram.

-- misc

  FPU   The production requires a Floating Point Unit maths coprocessor.
  HD    The production requires Hard Disk installation.


What follows are some of the 'codes' you'll encounter while reading the
party section, and their meaning. The first two letters usually signify the
platform, thus:

64      - commodore 64
ac      - acorn archimedes
am      - amiga
at      - atari
java    - java (platform independent)
lx      - linux
pc      - pc
psx     - playstation

And they are always followed by one of these:

demo    - demo
intro   - intro
4k      - 4k intro
40k     - 40k intro
64k     - 64k intro
game    - games
-dos    - (pc only) demo, dos based.
-3d     - (pc only) demo, 3d accelerated.

And finally these are some other codes you're likely to find...

anim    - animated graphics.
ansi    - ansi (pc 16 color textmode) graphics.
ascii   - ascii (amiga iso) graphics.
gfx     - graphics, usually meaning hand-pixeled.
gfx24b  - graphics, 24bit, usually meaning hand-pixeled.
raytrac - graphics, usually meaning raytraced.
rayanim - raytraced animation.

4chmus  - 4channel music
chipmus - chip music
mp3     - mp3 music
multich - multichannel music
wild    - wild demo
