Installation
------------

Just copy the files 'SeenPoint6.exe' and 'SeenPoint.Data'
into the same directory.

The mag can be started with the following flags from CLI:
NOMUSIC - Disables the music
NOINTRO - Skip the title pictures
NOANIMS - Disables the background animations

You can test these flags if you are low on memory and the mag
refuses to start.
