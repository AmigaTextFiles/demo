Did  anyone see the News At Ten on the
5th or 6th of October?  It featured an
A600.  It was telling the story of how
great  the machine is and how it has a
200%  performance rate over the top of
the  range  PC's  available and how it
was   the   next  generation  in  home
multimedia entertainment.

Unfortunately  this  was  not  for the
case.  When did you last see the Amiga
on  da  telly?   So  it  had to happen
didn't  it.   They  start  complaining
about   some  shitty  PD  game  called
Schoolyard  Slaughter,  a  game  which
requires you to shoot kids in the head
(body won't count) to score points and
how they want it banned.

Why?   Just  because  some maniac goes
mad  with  a  gun does not mean that a
child  who  has or will play this will
grow  up to do the same, does it?  Why
couldn't  they  just leave us be.  The
game  is from America and was released
a  year  ago.   Now the game is PD and
this,    therefore,    means    ]5FREELY]1
distributable,  so  how  the  fuck are
they  going  to  get  it banned.  News
stations  all  over  the  country have
just  sent  out a signal for the whole
Amiga  population to get their copy to
see what the fuss is all about.  I say
they are in a dream world.

Penguin  PD,  who  spoke  on the news,
have  gone  on  record saying they had
destroyed their master copy as soon as
they found out.  ]3BOLLOCKS!]1  They would
sell  hundreds  of  these within a few
days  because  of this publicity and I
for   one   don't  believe  they  have
stopped selling this.

I'll   finish  with  saying  that  the
Dunblane  victims,  although I do have
sympathy for them, are up in clouds if
they  think  this  game is going to go
out  of circulation overnight,  or for
that matter ]5EVER]1.
