»CL4:        by Cytron & Curt Cool

»CL0:Well, this was written after skipping
a night's sleep, so you will have to
excuse the occasional stupid comments.

Yes, it is true. Another issue of »CL8:The
Official Eurochart» has seen the light
of day, hitting the eye like the
bright summer sun outside, where we
ought to be, and maybe even will be
eventually.

Right now we are seated at what must
be one of the crappiest "parties" ever,
»CL3:The Copenhagen Party», but more about
that in the partyreport inside.

Notice the huge improvements in the
chart section - »CLA:105» quality snaps of
scene celebs and productions »CL1:(Please
do not steal these snaps, Napoleon.
Surely you must be able to make your
own or at least ask first)».

What has happened in the scene since
the last Eurochart? (»CL8:Beats me -CTN»)
A number of quality demos has been
released, Powerline's Icing winner,
Repugnance being probably the most
memorable effort, although Rebels'
Paranoid is also worth mentioning.
So obviously, the scene is neither
dead nor sleeping. New talents are
still arising, ensuring a future for
our favourite hobby, our dear »CL9:AMIGA»
scene.

Besides this, since last time the
editorial team has been partying,
drinking and smoking their brains
out at Roskilde Festival 1997 together
with some other members of our group,
Depth, and a lot of other friends.
Of course, Cytron acted very
naturally there, and of course, it was
raining most of the time. So it was
quite lucky that we brought those 4
garden pavillions. (Otherwise I
probably wouldn't have been able to
drink those 120 beers during those 7
days -CC).

Yes, we had fun. And we hope that you
will have fun as well, with this issue
of the Eurochart, and with the
wonderful summer.
