»CL0:Well, obviously this very forum has
involuntarily become the arena for a
scene war, a thing which in my opinion
belongs at the very dawn of the scene.

Yes, it is the war between »CL3:Michael/
Anathema» and »CL3:Shade/Digital» I am
talking about, and although this war
(as far as I know) is only fought with
words, it just seems like 2 silly kids
telling stupid lies about eachother.

Okay, maybe »CL1:Shade» is an incompetent
organizer, so what? Maybe »CL1:Michael's» a
liar, so what? Maybe they're both just
a bunch of little kids with big egos
who just can't stand eachother.

The scene doesn't care! Why don't you
guys fight it out or something?

I don't think that we need any more
slag-offs here, and further articles
in the same mould will be directly 
forwarded to the ObSceneties section,
to be laughed at by the whole
readership of »CL8:the Official Eurochart»
(the 2-3 ones there are left... ;-)
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL4:ps. I know both »CL5:Michael & Shade», and I
believe they are quite a nice bunch of
guys. So why? You are both ruining
your reputation in the scene with this
war. Stop it before it goes to far.
