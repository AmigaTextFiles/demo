»CL1:And the Great Chip said:»CL0: "Let there be
computer", and a big clumsy thing with
valves, tubes and pipes was created.

»CL1:The next day:
»CL0:The Great Chip saw that it was bad,
and therefore he said: "Let there be
fine little computer", and a Commodore
64 was created.

»CL1:The day after that:
»CL0:The Great Chip saw that it could be
even better, so he said: "Give me more
processor power and a harddisk", a
PeeCee appeared and he saw that it was
bad.
He didn't like it and cursed it, and
by accident the Mac was created.

»CL1:And the day after the day after that:
»CL0:Then he said: "Let there be creativity
and innovation", and the Amiga was
created.
    »PIC:Z1»











»CL0:At last he created users for the
Amiga, they were to bring it to Earth.
But accidently he forgot to throw out
some of the bad things he made, among
other things the PeeCee and Mac. Some
unintelligent humans brought it with
them to the Earth because they
believed that it would bring them joy
and happiness. But it didn't.

Some people with normal intelligens
took the Amiga with them to the Earth,
they knew that it would bring them joy
and happiness. (Some people didn't
bring any computers, they thought
there were better things to do on
Earth).

The Great Chip saw that it was bad,
and then He said: "Let the Amiga rule
the Earth once again!", and suddenly
the A\Box and the PIOS 1 were created.
