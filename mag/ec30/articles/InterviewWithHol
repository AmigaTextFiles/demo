»CL9:»SML:--------------------------------------


»CL5:CC:»CL4: Hi Hol! First I would like you
to tell me a bit about yourself, where
you live, family, study, scene? etc. 

»CL1:HOL:»CL0: Hum, well.. I'm English,
I'm 21, I've been hanging around
in the scene since about 1991,
nowadays I'm a computer
games designer for a living. And
that's about it. :)

»CL5:CC:»CL4: Well, sorry to bother you again,
but games designer is pretty much a
dreamjob of many a young scener these
days, so i wonder if you could explain
something about your job, where you're
working, how you got into that etc.
Or maybe these games will also feature
music by you?

»CL1:HOL:»CL0: Well, I went to uni, which was
very important, and then I was really 
intending to go into journalism (I've
done freelance work for PC Format
and Amiga Format, amongst others),
but I applied to a computer games
agency and they got me a couple
of interviews. and someone liked
me. :) I have nothing at all to do
with the music, though...
It's quite possible to get into
stuff like game design - you
just need to be determined
and lucky. and qualified in
»CL0:a weird way.. :P

»CL5:CC:»CL4: To get to the point, how did you
get the idea to start a "module group"
like Mono?

»CL1:HOL:»CL0: Well, whilst I was still into
the Amiga scene I was quite good
friends with Basehead, who is quite
a famous PC musician, and he got
me into Kosmic without me ever
really understanding who or what
they were. When I did understand,
I liked it, but I didn't really have 
much contact with anyone in the
group. I just released my 4-channel
tunes on Kosmic (www.kosmic.org
or www.kosmic.com on the Net,
I forget which..) and got a bit bored.
Then I began to realise I had quite

    »PIC:Z8»



















»CL0:a few friends on the scene whom I
thought made cool music, but never
got it spread. Therefore, I brought 
Mono into being in May 1996, 
basically on theAmiga to start 
with. It's gone much more 
crossover PC nowadays, which
is cool too. I wasn't the first to
do musicgroups on the Amiga,
I believe Black Sista were doing
it first (Orlingo and Mortimer
Twang's group..), but they never
really got round to releasing stuff,
so Mono was the first noticed
Amiga music-group. I should add
the idea is completely borrowed
from PC groups such as Kosmic

- I'm not claiming any originality.


»CL5:CC:»CL4: Why does these module groups
release "guest releases" from
eachothers' members? It seems a bit
silly to me, after all it's just a
question of which diz is in the
archive... ;)

»CL1:HOL:»CL0:Well, I don't think Mono has 
ever released any guest releases from
Phase Distortion, if that's what 
you're thinking - I just get people
I respect or like to put tunes out
on our label. A lot of them don't
have groups, like 4T Thieves,
Yolk, etc.. it's just some variety
and some fun.

»CL5:CC:»CL4: Why do the module groups, Mono not
excluded, only release techno modules
»CL4:of one kind or another? Aren't there
any good non-techno musicians left, or
is there another reason?

»CL1:HOL:»CL0: A lot of groups on the PC release
other stuff - Kosmic releases a lot of
other styles, groups like NOISE do
too. But elektronik musik is the music
of the moment. We like it, so we
release it - a lot of our musicians
used to compose other styles, but they
just enjoy composing dance music more.

»CL5:CC:»CL4: Mono isn't strictly AMIGA but
neverthless has its basis on the AMIGA
scene. Why release pc-xm's onto the
AMIGA scene?
[feel free to talk about OctaMed SS]

»CL1:HOL:»CL0: People can still listen to
PC mods on the Amiga, and since
a lot of people left on Amiga have
powerful computers, the loss
in quality isn't bad. In fact, I think
a lot more PC people listen to Mono
than Amiga, so I just want to make
sure all our releases can be heard by 
everyone. I don't really want to 
release Octamed tunes because 
they're not easily listenable on the
PC - fortunately none of our artists
really compose that way.

»CL5:CC:»CL4: When you release the modules in
such a simple manner, is it also
thought to be a way of gaining more
fame in the scene? After all the
module is the only thing you present,
there is no fancy code nor graphics to
lead the mind away from it...
»CL1:HOL:»CL0: Well, I think it's so good
to release tunes in this way because
you don't get conflicting graphics
and code. But the real reason to
release tunes this way is so 
they can be easily listened to,
and they're easy to spread, and
they make a point. And you don't
need to rely on lazy coders. :)

»CL5:CC:»CL4: Could you explain to me how you 
get the modules from your guest 
composers. Do you ask them or do they
ask you? 

»CL1:HOL:»CL0: I generally ask them, because
there's very few people I'd actually
want tunes from. but it's quite often
mutual, from discussions or chats
we have.

»CL5:CC:»CL4: I believe that Mono and PHD are
the leading module groups on the scene
today. How do you feel about the
competition? Hopefully both groups can
exist peacefully together?!


»CL1:HOL:»CL0: Yeah, we're pretty peaceful. I'm
on the PHD mailing-list and respect
them, and as long as they don't take
many cheap cracks at us, they'll
be no war. :)

»CL5:CC:»CL4: There are also some other module
groups who are more specific in the
choice of style (Black Sista etc.).
Do you think that is that the way to
go?

»CL1:HOL:»CL0: It's nice to have a little variety.
But not too much - Mono is pretty 
much down to jungle/triphop and
minimal techno nowadays, apart
from a few releases. And I think
that's about right for us.


»CL5:CC:»CL4: Tell me about the members of Mono,
music styles, etc. etc.
Surely we can expect some new Mono
goodies soon?!

»CL1:HOL:»CL0: Mono's got lots of members,
including Mortimer Twang, Relief,
Twilight, Dreamfish, myself,
Vim, Whiskas, Ramone, Substance
TheFoxII.. and more. :) As for 
goodies, we're working on some
interesting stuff.. no hints yet,
watch out. www.scene.org/mono
is the place to go.

»CL5:CC:»CL4: Okay, I think that is all for
today... Thank you for your time!
