»CL4:           by Pigeon/Depth

»CL0:After 5 sweaty hours in a bus, we
finally arrived at Stockholm. We means
me, Schindler, Marwic and Joule.
That damn taxidriver had some serious
problems in finding the place and
dropped us off a some unknown place
but we found our way. :)
After having settled in in a quiet
room with »CL1:Subspace» and »CL1:TBL» we checked
the party out. Bah.. »CL2:60» amiga owners
and »CL3:200» PC. And all the pc-users did
the usual stuff, Quake, Mp3s and
Fasttracker. While the Amiga-owners
did some serious coding, »CL1:Subspace»,
»CL1:Tolou», »CL1:Tbl», and »CL1:Vector» were those
groups I saw coding on their
demos/dentros all the time. I also
heard that »CL1:Rebels» sat about 1km from
the party in an apartment coding on
their demo. Then they came over and
won the democompo.
Well, while »CL1:Schindler» sat with KM and
some chick and watched all kinda
pornomovies I found my way to
»CL1:Olle/Factor» who was coding on his
multitracker. He also won the 40k
compo with his small intro.


All nice things happened, like the two
kickersgang who wanted to get in. The
police recommended us NOT to go out in
big gangs. The police sucks!!

The organizers were »CL1:VERY» serious,
playing porno AVI's on the bigscreen
and they had a big ftp site through
the network with about 5gigs of porno.
And Snuskis had a 22gig MP3 site,
total download about 168 gigs :)

I had fun there anyway, but I think
most Amiga people there thought it
sucked.
