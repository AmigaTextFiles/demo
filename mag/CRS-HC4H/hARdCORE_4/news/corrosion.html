   The release of our first music video - PHUSE, made for the track from the
   forthcoming hARdCoRRoSioN promo. The video was heavilly broadcasted
   throughout a lot of TV stations. The single was almost a month and a half
   residing on the first place of the yugoslav techno list on radio, although
   it was totally different from the other trance-shit music.

   DoMiNAToR held concert in Belgrade club Industria with KKPTSAI, organized
   by TECHNOCRATIA. This event, called YU:GO@, was totally disconceptual mix of
   GOA played by dj's and HardCore breakbeats from two heavily armed music
   crews. Technically, this event was a supreme demonstration of the new
   powerfull OctaMED SoundStudio software we started to heavilly abuse. Along
   with the music attack, we prepared a 43 minute video material, especially
   designed to support the music performance. A complete success! Read the
   phuzzy logik's report on the event!

   wiz/hitchhikers, the coder behind hARdCORE has gone to army 2 days ago.
   this means that coded issues of hardcore will be heavily delayed for some
   time in the future...

   CoRRoSioN is back from SCENEST. we had a wonderful time with great
   people but the party itself SUCKED A LOT!. it was bad organised, and the
   competitions were bad organised which is obvious if we mention the fact
   that the pc group ASTROIDEA was the organiser. the IMPULSE was doing it's
   best but they weren't allowed by the main organiser to do something
   better.
   <br><br>
   At SCENEST we released a 64k intro, we had 2 entries in the gfx compo
   and one in the 4ch music compo. Intro was 5th, Alex's picture was 9th,
   M-G's picture was 13th, DoMiNAToR's 4channel module was 11th. all in all,
   we were at the right places, because the winning gfx and modules sucked!
   our intro was ok, but the other entries had far better code, so... we sat
   down to improve!
   <br><br>
   At this point, it is important to mention that BORG, our 64k intro for
   Scenest, introduced our new coding force, Griffin. BORG was produced by
   Griffin, Suffocator, Alex and DoMiNAToR.

   We organized a demo party, the largest ever in Yugoslavia. It was big
   success, and we are already working on another one in September. The party
   was called SCENE STRIKE ONE, and you can read more about it in the phuzzy
   logik's article in YUSCENE section of hardcore #4.
   <br><br>
   Our releases on SCENE STRIKE were: BrainSurgery demo made by the same
   production team as BORG, 4channel modules by Alex, Paranoid and DoMiNAToR,
   multichannels by DoMiNAToR and paranoid, pixelled gfx by Alex and marcus
   garvey, photoshop gfx by Paranoid, raytraced gfx by griffin and gyro and
   last, but not the least, animation for wild compo, CoRRoSioN 6-minute long
   promo made by DoMiNAToR and marcus garvey.
   <br><br>
   SCENE STRIKE was part of our bigger project generally named Creative-Tech
   Week, whose aim was to promote computer generated art into public. It
   covered 2d and 3d gfx and animation, computer music, demo coding, ascii
   art, net.art and many, many topics about cyberpunk, films and various other
   uses of computers as an artistic tool.
   <br><br>
   Check out the experimental CTW web page at <a href="http://www.matgnet.com/ctw">www.matgnet.com/ctw</a>. There
   you'll find some of the art shown at the exhibition, mostly Yugoslav
   creations are put up there.
   <br><br>
