   <br><br>
   <b>Oberursel, February 25, 1997:</b> phase 5 digital products is proud to announce
   the upcoming BLIZZARD 603e Power Board, a PowerPC-based accelerators for
   Amiga 1200 and A1200-based Tower Systems. With this innovative and powerful
   new accelerator a new dimension of performance is brought to the Amiga 1200,
   with performance increases of multiple times beyond the performance of the
   fastest 68k based accelerators available today, for a sensationally low
   price that is perfectly targeted at the A1200 upgrade market.
   <br><br>
   Primarily being designed as an upgrade board for existing Amiga systems,
   the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board incorporates phase 5's innovative dual-processor
   technologie, where a fast PowerPC RISC processor is combined with a 68k
   processor, in case of the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board a 68030 CPU. Both CPUs
   dynamically share the memory and system busses, what is necessary for a
   true multiprocessor behaviour. While the original AmigaOS 3.x continues
   to run on the 68030 CPU - as well as all existing applications do, what
   provides 100% compatibility - the PowerPC 603e CPU is supported by a comprehensive
   PPC Library developed by phase 5, which provides all functionality to integrate
   the PowerPC into the Amiga multitasking environment. Software developers
   can easily optimze their programs step by step by porting single tasks to
   PowerPC code, which then can run parallel with 68k tasks. Many important
   Amiga software vendors are preparing ported or optimized versions of their
   software packages already, so it is expected that a large quantity of software
   products supporting the PowerPC will be available soon.
   <br><br>
   The BLIZZARD 603e Power Board will be availabe with the fast PowerPC603e
   processor at a clock speed of 175 MHz; a socket is provided for the 68030
   companion processor in a PGA housing. It provides a fast memory expansion
   option which uses standard PS/2 type SIMMs. The memory is dynamically shared
   by the two CPUs on the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board . As an option, as very
   inexpensive Fast SCSI-II controller will be available for the BLIZZARD 603e
   Power Board, which combines transfer rates of up to 10 MB/s with the flexibility
   and expandability of the SCSI standard.
   <br><br>
   With it's 175 MHz 603e processor the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board provides
   - only on the PPC side - a raw performance of approximately 170 MIPS or
   approximately 3.5 SPECint95 and 2.8 SPECfp95 (estimations based on Motorola/IBM
   manufacturer specifications) - a blistering performance that can compete
   with most of the fastest PC systems available today. with this performance
   the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board is ready for the most demanding applications
   such as 3D rendering and high-speed 3D gameplaying, image manipulation,
   animation, video applications, and many other demanding applications that
   depend on fast CPU performance.
   <br><br>
   The BLIZZARD 603e Power Board will be delivered with a comprehensive software
   package, which includes the PPC library as well as tools for creative users,
   among them a Public Domain GNU C compiler for PowerPC (including sourcecode)
   and many demo programs and utilities with sourcecode; in addition to this
   software free developer support is available via the phase 5 FTP site. Last
   not least a PowerPC-optimized version of CyberGraphX V3 with RISC-optimized
   CyberGL/3D and MPEG functions and libraries is included (with a special
   GGX driver to support the AGA chipset) - of course with comprehensive documentation.
   <br><br>
   The BLIZZARD 603e Power Board will be selling for a price that can be called
   sensational, offering a superior price/performance relation. The suggested
   retail prices are as follows:
   <br><br>
   <b>BLIZZARD 603e Power Board w/ 175 MHz 603e processor<br>
   DM 795,- / GBP 299.00 incl. VAT / USD 429.00 excl. VAT / KAN$ 599 excl. VAT</b>
   <br><br>
   Note: All prices are recommended retail prices. English and german price
   include local VAT, the recommended US price does not include local taxes.
   The prices are without the 68030 CPU which is necessary to operate the BLIZZARD
   603e Power Board. 68030 processors from existing processor boards can be
   used on the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board by pluging these into the provided
   socket. If you don't own a 68030 CPU already, ask you local dealer for an
   attractive bundle offer.
   <br><br>
   Registered owners of a Blizzard 68030 board will - within the PowerUp upgrade
   program - receive special, attractive upgrade offers by mail during March
   97. The handling of these upgrades will be done via local appointed representatives.
   <br><br>
   The delivery of the BLIZZARD 603e Power Board is scheduled for late May
   1997. Availability for the A1200 desktop system is depending on the finalization
   of the CE approvals until that date.
