I just had hardly got back from our Symposium (beer)tour a week ago and 
recovered from the fever i was gifted with after, yet on friday i had to
prepare my stomach again for another weekend-trip with friends.

Scenest are always the bigest hungarian scene events, so just like this year,
too. The place was the same as all Scenest were in the last 3 years, a
technical college in northwest of Budapest. Since i belonged to those white
t-shirt dicks now (organizer) i needn't have paid the entrance, though i
don't think anyway it'd have hurted me a lot (900 FT = 9 DM). The first night
went quite fast. We occupied the apx. 200m from the party situated 'Guiness
pub', that already became our haunt and secondary partyplace as well at
partytimes.

On saturday morning after a nice sleep i woke at 8 and wondered a bit how i
had managed to get back there, but who cared, anyway. The whole morning went
quite fast again. Scorpik's PC fucked up so he couldn't finish his module
(in spite he got the 3rd place at last, anyway), so we rather visited some
nonstop shops around to fasten going the time. When we wanted to enter back
to the partyplace from our morning trip, i showed my ticket, they said
'no way!'. What the fuck?! I was an organizer! I showed my T-shirt, too. They
replied the same again... then my friend told perhaps because i had a 3 litre
canna in my hand...

In the evening the no.1 hungarian rock-guitarist (Pavelka Gyuszi / AKELA)
also arrived. We wanted to make a concert together, but since our first
way lead into our 'secondary partyplace', we needed somebody to support back
to the party with a shoulder. Thus this duo idea cancelled. Anyway, in spite
this i plugged my guitar and started 'playing' alone. I was shocking the
audience for 20 mins or so, but you know it was funny, because I was so upset
i saw the contour of the guitar only and didn't know at all what i played.
After i've managed to get on pc's nerves enough i went in the mainhall and
snored a good during the compos.

On sunday i woke for the early 7 o'clock results-showing (that sucked, btw
- they didn't know the name of the competitor, only the number - therefore i
was not surprised when somebody else got the money for the 2nd place PC
demo ... though it was corrected later - i should have been faster ;))

<ul>
 <li>1100 or so visitor (also from Poland, Serbia, Austria - what happened to
  you, Uyanik!? - and Slovakia) ... that's much, eh?
 <li>good handled compos (no delays even on pc either)
 <li>nice prizes (e.g demo: 500 DM + 1000 DM voucher 
                  intro: 100 DM + 1000 DM voucher)
 <li>The Amiga demo compo cancelled because of NO contributions!
  (and only 5 AMIGA intros - where is our scene?!)
 <li>very cheap buffet (e.g 2 DM = pizza, 1.5 DM = big warm sandwich)
 <li>no power problems at all, nor powercuts either
 <li>there were wash-hand basins, but no showers ;(
 <li>enough big and warm sleeping-rooms
