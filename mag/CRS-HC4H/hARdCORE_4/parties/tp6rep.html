<h2><font color="#e02055">Party report from The Party 6 in Aars, Denmark.</font></h2>
<br><br><br>
<font color="#8080d0">I left my house in Årnes, Norway at 10:30. The bus were going leave from the
railwaystation in Oslo at 12:00.. At around 11:30 I arrived at Oslo S. (The
railwaystation).. There I met up with Skjeggspir/Contraz and some other
dudes waiting for the bus.. We got all packed up, and opened the first beer
1 minute later! :) Baffle/Delirium had brought with him 8 0.5l cans of beer,
and I got 4 of them.. STh/Corrupt had some whitewine, but the other dudes
mostly had to stay thirsty! (Poor fellas..) Around 14:00-14:30 we stopped in
Porsgrunn, Norway, to pick up some more people.. we had been used to have
plenty of space up to now, but after this stop the bus got quite full.. ;/
We arrived in Kristiansand, Norway, around 19:00 or so, and the ferry left
at 19:30.</font>

<font color="#8080d0">When we got on the boat, the first thing we went to was, you got it, the
bar! :) Some time after we all got our first beer, they actually raised the
limit to buy beer to 20 years! I have no idea why, since the boat was a
norwegian and danish boat, and in both countries you can buy beer when
you're 18.. but.. ;/ well.. anyways, they did!.. and only Sixpack/Gods and
Ludde was more than 20 years old.. (It was 7 days left until my 20th
birthday) but still the barkeeper was convinced that I were 20, so I didn't
have any problems with this, but all the others had.. So they went to the
taxfree-shop to buy some beer, and I joined them, since they're all good
friends, and it's not cool drinking beer almost alone :).. I bought another
sixpack.. then we went outside and started boozing some more.. After a
while, two of the officers of the boat came along and spotted us.. They told
us with quite a friendly voice (they were 2, we were 15..) that we weren't
allowed to drink beer we had bought in the taxfree-shop.. ;/ so.. we left
this place, and went back inside to find some other place to drink.. we
ended up back in the bar.. I bought a new beer, so I got a glass.. And then
I just sat there refilling my glass when it started to get empty.. Worked
fine.. well.. after this I don't remember much actually.. I guess you can
read about me in Baffle's collection, and some other norwegian peoples
collection too.. I barely remember that I filled out the small blanket at
the entrance to TP, but that's it.. I was in! :) (I later got told I had
puked in the middle of the bar, and also on my and Baffles cd's, and Baffle
scarf.. I'm not sure.. Baffle had carried me off the boat.. never mind.. ;))</font>

<font color="#8080d0">The first thing we did inside the partyplace was to rig up our stereo.. We
had two 15" loudspeakers.. so.. enough sound for everyone, and we got 4
complaint from the organizers about playing too loud, and the 4th time they
told us, that if they got more complaint about us, they would have to do
something about it!.. we also got some complaints from other people.. so we
were forced to turn down the volume.. ;( What kind of a party is this?? A
bingo-evening for old people? WE WANNA PLAY LOUD! but no way.. we had
arrived at the partyplace around 03:00 on the 27th, so there weren't that
many people there yet.. this is probably why they were complaining.. we were
the only ones playing loud.. yet.. So.. I decided to go to sleep.. I could
need some sleep to get rid of the alcohol in my blood..</font>
<center><ul><li></ul></center>
<font color="#8080d0">When i woke up again, there were looads of people present, and I could feel
the "party feeling" rise in my blood, although I had a bit of a hangover..
it actually wasn't that bad, since I had puked and so on.. And I usually
don't get that much of a headache.. Everyone always hates me for that :)..
Anyways.. I got up, and started walking around trying to find some familiar
faces, uh.. handles :).. The first people I met were Speed Devil.. We were
talking with Crisp/BK and Franky/BK.. Nice to meet you guys!.. That day I
met MANY people.. like Fury/PSG (Hi, handsome! ;)), Nike/TRSI (Bergensere,
uff..), Marwic/TRSI (Tjena're polar'n.. Du skulle ha supat lite mere!),
Whirlwind/RYL (He's too shy to even give away a hug!), Repoman/Massive
(wildcompo bidragene var helt sinnsykt heftige, så..), Bakerman/Depth (Merry
Christmas, santa!), Curt Cool/Depth (Just woke up, eh?), Mat/Ozone (Too bad
about the handdrawn pics, dude.. Hope you can get your hands on 'em again)
Flozzy/Decision (Stop using your mac, and start boozing!), Zinko/RYL
(Mr.linguistic!), Clary/Crux (Aspirine! Aspirine!), Jerry/rebels (Haiket
dere? ;D), Slime/Royal (Get more stickers next time! ;)), Radiocity/DCN
(Real cool to see you, m8! You should get some more beers, and go boozing
with us!), Snuffy/Babe (Mmm... Hei, elskling.. Du gir bedre klemmer enn
Baffle!), Kaneda/Mystic (Speak up, m8! get some beer and go party next
time!), Radavi (Didn't see you after that time with all the balloons and
stickers.. Or did I?), Uyanik/TRSI^FLT (Did you sell some more cd's? ;)),
Rekall (Schust grabben!.. eller hur fan du skriv det.. ;)), xxx/Haujob
(Partymensch #1!), Mario/TRSI (Kewl meeting you, m8!), ECS/TRSI (Du auch!,
or something)... hm.. many more too I guess.. Can't remember everyone!</font>

<font color="#8080d0">On the 27th we were sitting in Hall 2 drinking beer.. Baffle and I had some
beers which we shared, and Rekall had some Vodka.. others also had booze,
but I can't remember everything.. The reason for why I remember these things
so good is that when I were sitting there drinking my beer, suddenly it got
snapped out of my hands, by a.. GUARD! oh no!.. fuck.. Baffle gave away his
beer freely, without being asked.. I have no idea how he (the guard) could
turn up so suddenly.. Noone saw him before he snapped my beer out of my
hands!.. ;/ too bad.. well.. he left, and Baffle and I almost started
drinking again (Baffle had a plasticbag full of beer under his chair.. But
then another guard (or was it the same? I don't remember..) came along with
a flashlight.. And he pointed it at Rekall's plasticbag, like if he wanted
to see what was in it.. Rekall picked up a can of soda.. Hoping that the
guard would settle with that.. but no.. He walked over to rekall's place,
opened the plasticbag, and picked out 0.5l of smirnoff vodka.. almost
unopened.. Cybergod had taken one SMALL sip out of it.. so we were quite
upset.. Luckily the guard still didn't notice Baffle's bag, so we could keep
on drinking.. Due to these incidents, we moved out to a van outside.. Snuffy
and some of his friends, owned it, and there were room for more people.. we
were around 25 people or something.. WAY too many.. But I don't know what
happened to most of us.. Suddenly we were only norwegian people, except for
Cybergod from Sweden.. At least there were room enough for us now.. :)
plenty of fun, and no guards! ;D</font>
<center><ul><li></ul></center>
<font color="#8080d0">When we were out of booze, we left for the city.. or well.. rather a small
village or something.. two small pubs, and one small disco.. We met up with
some other people in the town and entered the first pub.. there were like..
5-6 people there or something, and they were all old.. But then we came in.
and the place really took off.. One of us (don't remember who) had a small
stereo with him, and he were playing some kewl ravemusic.. but then he got
told by the people who owned the place, that e had to turn off the music..
so.. we left!.. Then we got to the disco.. (We never went to the other pub,
just outside it.. it looked deserted!).. well.. the disco wasn't that bad
this weekend.. It must've been cool to live in Aars this weekend.. the place
were soaking with forreigners, and it was real fun.. Baffle was getting very
drunk by this time, and he tried to hang in the lights above the
dancefloor.. :) ofcourse he got some complaints from the owners, so he
stopped.. I didn't see him in a while actually.. but everyone was real
happy, and I had a great time!.. When I got back home I went to sleep almost
immidiately.. I was so fucking tired you know!</font>
<center><ul><li></ul></center>
<font color="#8080d0">The next day, when I woke up, I went to the cafeteria and bought 1.5l of
7up.. In the queue I met up with Clary again.. Happy reunion :).. She told
me the other people (Fury, Skywalker and Zinko at the moment I think) were
sitting upstairs.. so.. after buying the soda, I went up there.. Everyone
looked like hell that day, And Clary had some Aspirine.. She claimed they
worked, but I never tried them.. Mario and ECS also came upstairs after a
while, and everyone started to speak german.. Except for Clary and me,
everyone knew german.. So.. atleast I felt kinda stupid just sitting there,
not understanding anything.. So.. I left to find Baffle, and check what he
had been doing last night.. I couldn't find him.. So I went to see Nike .. I
think.. well.. atleast I went around for a while.. Then someone (I think it
was Skjeggspir/Contraz) told me that Baffle had been kicked out of the
party!!.. Cheezus!.. So.. I went outside to look for him, but I couldn't
find him.. Later on I found him sitting in the cafeteria, still looking like
hell.. He stopped drinking 10 hours earlier but was still drunk.. So..
probably someone had put something in his glass or something.. I dunno..
Well.. Baffle had been playing music at max volume during the multichannel
competition :) so.. some guards came over to him, to make him stop playing..
When they got there, they found a Baffle drunk like hell, just babling..
So.. They threw him out, and told him that he could get his wrist-ban back,
when he was sober.. So.. bye bye Baffle.. He was in that cafeteria for 15
hours or so, and then he came back in..</font>
<center><ul><li></ul></center>
<font color="#8080d0">Ofcourse we had to drink this day too.. Zinko and Clary had some beers, and
I tasted some of theirs.. (I didn't have anything).. Then I got a beer from
The Godfather and Mute.. Since they had some in their car.. I also got some
vodka from Ludde, Skjeggspir/Contraz and Rekall (not that much from any of
them though ;/) But.. We (Ludde, Skjeggspir, Rekall and I) sat at my place
watching the wild-compo.. fuck.. It was awesome!.. Some of the competitors
had really spent time on making them, and I was impressed like hell!..
well.. since it was getting a bit late.. Rekall, Sixpack/Gods and I decided
to go downtown for some more beers.. on the way out we met Zinko and Clary
again, and we made plans to go to the same place this night too (As if there
were any choice :)).. we got to Sixpacks table, so he could pick up some
more beer, and then Rekall went over to his table to get some more vodka..
and then!.. we hit the streets.. I was just stealing from sixpack and
rekall.. :) well.. as we were walking around we met up with xxx/haujob and
some other german people.. they were quite drunk too, and were running
around making a mess.. :) after a while we(six, rek & I) went back to
disco.. There weren't that many people there yet, but we met Anders/Proxima
and some other pc-sceners from Finland, and norway.. and had some more
beer.. then people started showing up one after another.. and the place was
taking off again :)</font>
<center><ul><li></ul></center>
<font color="#8080d0">Baffle didn't show up this time, since he was feeling rather sick.. But the
rest of us had a really good time.. Skjeggspir got himself a girlie, and
they're going to write to eachother and blah blah.. u know.. I don't know
what will happen, but since it's q while 'till the next time Skjeggspir will
be in dk, you can all take a guess.. Enex/contraz also got a gf, and he
also shagged her that night :) So know you all know, hehe.. the beer costed
a little bit more than 2$ (15 DKR) for one bottle of Tuborg (0.33l).. quite
cheap for us norwegians when we're used to paying 5-6$ for 0.5l beer.. Yep..
Norway is very expencive... Everyone were buying loads, and I had a really
great time this night as well.. I also met Sisko and Bilbo Baggins this
night.. The demo competition started at 04:00 this night.. And I was going
to watch it ofcoz.. But.. I fell asleep.. thypical.. well.. nevermind.. I'll
get to see the demos later..</font>
<center><ul><li></ul></center>
<font color="#8080d0">The 29th, someone woke me up with the words "We're leaving in 30 mins!"..
uhm.. nice.. not!.. We were going to leave at 10:00 !.. that's too fucking
early in my opinion.. but.. there were nothing I could do.. I didn't have
much to pack.. no computer with me etc.. I actually never even touched a
poweroutlet this weekend.. :) what a computer-party!.. never touched a
keyboard either.. I played some playstation though.. Well anyways.. I
started walking around to find people and telling them goodbye.. I think I
got most of them, but I never found Zinko or Clary.. ;/ well.. never mind!..
I can say goodbye to you now! ;) And I'll probably meet you on irc or
something.. heh.. well.. anyways.. Noone could find Ludde.. He was sleeping
somewhere but we had to use 30 mins to find him, and then some minutes for
him to pack.. so.. we didn't leave until 10:30 or something like that I
guess.. When we got to Aalborg, we still had to wait almost 2 hours for the
ferry, so I don't know why we had to leave so early from the partyplace..
well well.. at least we had the time to buy some food.. the burgers tasted
like shit though.. I'll never figure out how danish people survive, when all
their food taste like shit.. ;/</font>
<center><ul><li></ul></center>
<font color="#8080d0">The weather was real bad, and we had big waves on the sea.. AGAIN!.. but
this time I didn't drink much.. had a piña colada.. but that's not much..
But still I felt kinda sick.. then I heard they were selling sea-sick
pills.. Yes!.. I bought one, and went to sleep.. mm.. that sure helped..
When I woke up I felt quite nice, although the waves were still there.. I
wasn't feeling that bad.. back in Kristiansand, Norway, some people were
going to use the train for Bergen.. they just missed it by.. 2 minutes or
so.. And had to wait 6 hours or something for the next one.. ;( really sux..
I'm glad I wasn't one of them.. Well.. the rest of us left Kristiansand, and
headed back towards Oslo.. In Grimstad we met Snuffy and the other people
from the van at a gas-station.. :) That was cool.. and finally.. some
norwegian food! mm.. yummie.. ;).. Sixpack opened another beer, and he was
drinking 6 beers on the way home I think.. all the others felt too bad, and
didn't want anything.. The stopped a couple of times by the road, to let
people off, and we came to Oslo at 02:30 on the 30th.. My brother and his gf
had been waiting for an hour, so they were a bit upset.. although they got
happy when I gave them the smoke I had bought for them from the boat ;).. I
came back home around 04:00.. My mom gets up at 05:00 to go to work, so she
didn't get much sleep that night.. but anyways.. I think I've never been
this tired after a party before! It was, in my eyes, a success.. Although
there were too many guards walking around checking out what you were
drinking :).. I've had a hell of a great time, at it was real nice meeting
everyone!.. I'll be at the next TP for sure! Since it's a blast!.. The last
tp got loads of complaints, but I liked that one too, so.. I don't care
about it.. :) If I didn't meet you this time, be on the next one.. I can
meet you there!</font>
