After coming home the morning after Scene Strike, I fell unconcious
and although planning to go to Cinema Rex at noon or so, I jumped
from bed at 4PM, pretty freaked out and stoned... Got my clothes on
and jumped on a tram... vrm, vrm, vrrrrrm, up to Rex, where I came
in AFTER all the heavy duty work was done. Hehehehe... Evil, aren't
I?
<br><br>
We planned for the concert to begin at 6PM, but there was bloody
NOONE there at that time... the problem was, there was bloody noone
there at any time after that... so we just wasted a heck of a lot of
time waiting for someone to show up, and fucked around with the
equipment in the meantime. There was lots of heavy duty stuff there,
power amps, a bunch of 'puters, alex's guitar, video beam bullshit,
strobes, and all kinds of other hi tek mumbo-jumbo. It was one of
the funnest "waitings" in my life.
<br><br>
Lots of modules were played, although the one that stuck in my head
for quite a while after was Six Million Ways to Die, by RaatoMestari
of the Mighty Jormas... Dominator just kept playing it, over and
over and over and over... somehow, I got the impression that he
liked that tune. Wonder where that came from?
<br><br>
So, at a certain point in time, someone finaly decided that we
should go for it, no matter how small the audience was. That turned
out to be one of the greatest ideas any one of us had in a while.
<br><br>
The last concert I visited was the one in Industry, where Domin8r
was on stage as part of a g*a night, so I remember his last show to
be a dehydrated hop-on-one-leg freaky bouncing-off-other-people
overcrowded gig, which kicked serious ass, but the hoparound factor
was quite limited. This time, everything was different.
<br><br>
As I judge it, there were around 50 people there, maybe slightly
less, which is quite a success considering that Kalichanin was
making a mega-ultra-turbo-g*a party the same evening, and also
considering the fact that our gig was starting at 6PM... who on
Earth goes out at that time, right? Again, I must say, it turned out
to be an excellent idea...
<br><br>
So, at around eight o'clock (maybe slightly earlier) someone decided
to commence the blastoff. First in line was a friend of Alex's, who
played a breakbeatish tune of his, quite slow, but well done, nice
for a warmup... Then it was supposed to be my turn, but I was
cheated out of murdering the audience with my desintegrator sounds,
so we skipped to the next ones in line, so...
<br><br>
Right after that, hARdCoRRoSioN was up there... bloody motherfuckin'
DESTRUCTION. Kick ass. Major Ass. Fanplastic show. I am utterly
speachless. We were bouncing around C-Rex all over, jumping,
whaling, waving, raving... okay, not raving... but you get the idea.
Almost the entire CoRRoSioN posse was down with the sound... Several
other hardcore people in the room... and a few obvious misfits, who
believed this to be some sort of "psychodelic trance" bullshit thing
like the stuff they usually attend. They looked like idiots trying
to do their classic "dance, party people!" type of faggot moves. We
didn't pay much attention to them.
<br><br>
Kole Kojot & Ptica Trkacica Strikes Again Ipak (phew) were OKay,
but, as sadly as it is, I must notice that they are getting quite
monotoneous lately. I got in a bit of a fight with an Integra DJ
over whether they were run over by time or not (or was he from
Kozmik? Whatever...) and even though I defended them heavily back
then, hearing them again and comparing them to hARdCoRRoSioN, I must
revoke my harsh words I directed at whoever it was on the "Insomnia"
list and admit - they have been run over. Heavily. They have kickass
equipment, but they are obviously not using it right. I sat in front
of the video beam watching Grommit during most of their performance.
To be frank, I just waited for them to get it over with, so that I
can take a leak. Fuck you if you didn't get the joke.
<br><br>
Then, for the grand finale, Dominator went up for his solo
performance, aided only by Paranoid by the other Amiga, for the
quality mixing. Do I realy have to describe the sort of mass murder
he committed?
<br><br>
It felt like three hops from side to side, in the enormous C-Rex
hall, while jumpin to his beats. Played some old stuff, some new
stuff, some ancient stuff which, opposite to KKPTSAI's music, still
is very up to date... Everybody was hopping around, Alex was up for
doing a bit of the Pinball routine, which we did, bouncing around,
and bothering other people. Infusion and Devlink kept getting in the
way, and I whammed into Bepa twice, but other than that, C-Rex was
empty enough for us to let all our surplus energy out. Not to
mention Becha, who l8r described Domin8r's set as "busting us
apart".
<br><br>
Then, the sad ending. C-Rex is a residential building, so we had to
finish up the beats by 22:00 sharp. So we, or rather, he did, while
we still hoped for a bit of on-core. Nope, none of that came, so we
had to break it up...
<br><br>
The few fluorescent idiots went out to ride down to the Shlep, where
they could try to get back to their usual dumb selves by listening
to some crap g*a... The non-corrosive people who were around greeted
the posse and took off... While we remained to scrape the remains of
the equimpent off the stage, pack it up, and go home.
<br><br>
To cut the "aftershock" crap short, after playing some of Djordje
Balashevic's greatest hits on Alex's guitar, we packed everything,
and fled the place. M-G took me and my Motherfucker home in his
vehicle, and exhausted, but fucked-up-happy, I installed the MF back
in it's place, and dropped back to bed.
<br><br>
No ringing in the morning this time, unfortunately, so I can't
finish this article off as cool as I did with the last one... but
what the fuck, hardcore still does continue...
<br><br>
... and it will never fuckin' die!!!
