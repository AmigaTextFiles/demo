<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">The rain started falling that
day, as if to create the ultimate scenery for a cyberpunk
event... nck and myself crept around town for a while, since we
arrived an hour early, and there wasn't a living soul in
industry... we bummed around town, stared at windows and generaly
just did what people do when they have an hour to kill... Half an
hour later, we decided it was pointless, and too freakin'
COLD, so we headed back to industry and bravely entered. </font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">A door in front of me. Ukhm,
well, whatever the hell is in front of me, doesn't realy
look like a door. It's more like a... a... <b>STAIRWAY</b>!!!

 stopped us (huh?! free entrance? cool...)</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">We strolled casually down and
entered the arena (I know, I am starting to sound corny... okay,
I'll stop it...) Through the darkness I spotted some of the
corroded gang, at first only the girls, but then also the
dudes... there was a flurry of action around a couple of </font><font

plugging, unplugging, setting and resetting, poking fingers and

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">We've greeted the people
and stuffed ourselves aside, staring at the hypnotising screen in
the corner of the room... a couple of ravers here and there, not
much people, huh? </font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">&quot;Don't stare at it
for too long, dude... you get hypnotised... it's for the goa

will be a GOA night, and then kick the shit out of them with sum

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">Midnight... the stage seems to
be set, and Domin8r, Paranoid and the gang seem to be in deep
meditative trances, sippin' beer through juice straws and
preparing themselves psychophysicaly for the upcoming
performance... There's quite a lot of people here now, and
DJ Sun is playing some goa... yawn...</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">&quot;When do ya play,

insomnia... yawn... yawn... yawn...</font></p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="3">One o'clock is coming...
ten-fifteen minutes... or so... the word spreads &quot;soon,
soon...&quot; One of the corroded babes taps me on the shoulder
&quot;c'mon, let's make room in front of the
stage...&quot; I hop readily, doin' my
top-secret-ninja-turtle-micro-muscle-warm-up-excercizes, and
strawl out on the stage. A few elbows here, a few shoulders
there, some other extremities over at those chicks, and voila,
breathing space... We all get crammed in the little void, and
