Cyberculture has given rise to a social and artistic
community whose members may have never touched a keyboard,
yet finds its very foundations in the computer. It is called
electronica, rave or cyberpsychedelia, and it takes the form
of a big, communal party.
<br><br>
Culturally speaking, it was the California "bohemian"
communities that first embraced the computer as a tool of
artistic and spiritual expression. As early as the
mid-1970s, psychedelic renegade Timothy Leary was appearing
in documentaries predicting that someday in the future, all
of us would be exchanging messages electronically through
our "word processors." The visionary Whole Earth Review
editor and ex-Merry Prankster Stewart Brand announced to his
hippie, environmentalist following that computers should be
seen as aids to positive social and spiritual
transformation. West Coast rock musicians like the Grateful
Dead and Todd Rundgren were the first to popularize
colorful, swirling computer graphics on concert tickets and
video projections during shows.
<br><br>
Maybe this is why the first major impact of computers and
the Internet on our culture has been in the music and club
communities of young people. Cheap microprocessing
technology put high-quality sound synthesizers and mixing
studios in the hands of musicians who had never had access
to professional recording equipment before. These young
musicians, generally members of the countercultural
communities who had already embraced computer technology,
were profoundly changed by their ability to manifest in
sound almost anything they could imagine.
<br><br>
By the late 1980s, a global community of young people had
formed around this music and the gatherings at which it was
played. Some say it started in England or the popular
vacation spot for Brits, the island Ibeza. Others credit the
"techno" clubs of Detroit. Wherever it began, "rave" had
become a cultural phenomenon as big as rock and roll.
Literally thousands of kids would drive to remote locations,
usually outdoors, ingest mild psychedelics and dance until
morning to electronic music made by young people a lot like
them. Although rock and roll enthusiasts considered this
early rave music dull and repetitive, the kids who danced to
it appreciated it deeply.
<br><br>
As democratic as the Internet itself, rave music could be
produced by almost anybody. Moreover, it was composed of
digitally recorded samples of music and sounds from around
the world: the South American shaman's drum beat could ride
under the sound of industrial machinery. The bleeps of a
videogame could accent the vocals of a Pakistani chant. This
was a global community at least as diverse as any Usenet
newsgroup.
<br><br>
The rave experience is powerful and bonding. In reaction to
the expensive and status-conscious disco scene, rave
gatherings are usually free, welcoming of all, and anything
but a meat market. People don't dance in couples, but in one
big group-- sometimes in the thousands. It's a very
accepting group experience, something like a mosh pit but
without the aggressive, "extreme sports" vibe. It's just one
big group of happy people, recreating a tribal celebration.
<br><br>
Psychedelics like Ecstasy are common, and-- when they work
right-- serve as a social grease. Everyone dances to the
120-beat-per-minute music for hours on end until, sometime
late in the evening, a magical moment happens: The dancers
all experience themselves as one, big, coordinated being. By
the next morning, everyone is talking about the Gaia
Hypothesis, and how humanity itself may be evolving into a
giant single organism.
<br><br>
Now, ten years after all these underground gatherings began,
rave music and the other genres it spun off are finally
hitting the headlines as a "new" category of dance music
called "electronica," and the world's major record labels
are desperate to join in. Why is it suddenly finding such
popularity? Partly because the music is, quite frankly,
better. Ten years has seen at least three waves of musicians
develop new and more intricate styles of composition and
instrumentation.
<br><br>
The other reason electronica is becoming so popular is that
the rest of our culture is finally catching up with the
electronic vanguard. Our appetite for electronic music and
group revelry was whetted by our participation in an
electronic society. As with the Internet, however,
electronica has a lot of people-- mostly businessmen--
scared. Unlike rock concerts, raves don't focus on the
stars. There are no rock heroes to worship, only records and
CDs by relatively anonymous artists. Just as the Internet
tends to destroy the illusion of authority, electronic music
removes the cult of personality from the music scene, and
this makes it a marketer's nightmare. But whenever
businessmen are afraid, chances are something positive is
happening.
<br><br>
Electronic music embodies and amplifies the core values of
the original Internet community: there is no boss, anyone
can participate, and the more contributions from around the
world, the better. The object of a rave dance is to join a
large group together, at least temporarily, into a single,
joyful, coordinated being. Music from around the world is
all experienced in an extended, blissful moment. How much
closer to the utopian dreams of the Internet can a cultural
movement get?
<br><br>
Like any profound group experience, a good rave can get
people speaking a bit too naively about our collective fate.
Just as the Internet provoked some pretty Pollyanna-ish
scenarios about our digital future (I was as guilty of this
as anyone), the spirituality of the rave scene has led to
some optimistic but almost farcical predictions of our
coming "planetary consciousness." My novel Ecstasy Club is a
satirical send-up of these sweet but somewhat overblown
aspirations.
<br><br>
Still, the fact remains that the first real cultural
outgrowth of the computer revolution did not turn out to be
the solitary, nonphysical experience that many had feared.
If anything, it is a reclamation and assertion of the body
in the face of our seemingly mechanized computer lifestyles.
There is most definitely a thriving cyberculture gaining
influence around the world. You just have to get off the
computer and out of the house to experience it.
