<p><font size="3">DHR INTERVIEW FROM JAPANESE WAX MAGAZINE, issue 5/95.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>WAX: When and how started DHR?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">DHR (J.Amaretto): We (that's Pete Lawton
in London, Alec Empire and me in Berlin) started in January
'94. we took the advence for an aborted album of Atari
Teenage Riot (Alec Empire band with Carl Crack and Hanin Elias)
off the british major company Phonogram. that was the first step
of our masterplan:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To steal the money from a major company and
then release our material on our own label, where no boring
A&amp;R fart can limit us. Atari Teenage Riot never released this
record on Phonogram UK, because it was to hard, extreme and noisy
for them. As they signed the band they thought ATR are the
Hard-Eurodance-Version of 2 Unlimited or Prodigy. But that was
their fault, not ours.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>WAX: It seems that DHR is
specialized in Hardcore Breakbeat. How is your relationship with
Jungle?</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">DHR (J.Amaretto): DHR is not a pure Hardcore
Breakbeat label. In the beginning we use on our first releases
breakbeats only, because unlike to Great Britain the breakbeats
in this piece of land were understood and used politically. While
the House Nation demonstrated for &quot;Peace! Happiness!
Pancake!&quot; in the Love Parade (No Joke!) and ignoring
everything else. Alec Empire took a clear stand, shortly after
the first neonazi murders of foreigners and people who thought
differently to themselves with the track &quot;Hetzjagd Auf
Nazis&quot; (engl. &quot;Hunt the Nazis down!&quot;) on the
&quot;SuEcide Pt.2 E.P.&quot; on Force Inc. At that time (end of
'92) the acts on Force Inc. were the only ones in the german
underground who withstood the oncoming commercialisation of
Techno through Mayday, Hardtrance and press hypes like Neodisco.
Their incredible energy alone was an opposition to the narcotic,
assonance aligned techno sludge. Now DHR-acts like Ec8or (aka
E-de Cologne), Atari Teenage Riot and Sonic Subjunkies use also
straight bassdrums, because it's not a politically thing any
longer. We think that this new and young hardcore generation
shows more than enough that not all electronic music is Techno or
House. We liked jungle in the past, bacause in the beginning this
kind of music was extremelly loud, primitive and nerves-steeling.
Now most of the jungle productions are nothing more than 90ies
soul for unwordly disco lovers and fashion suckers. They were
only a few records in the last six months we can accept.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>WAX: Do you organize raves or
techno club events?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">DHR (J.Amaretto): We're not interested in
this techno-club-rave-thing. About parties and raves in this
old-fashioned context want that the people feel happy and forget
their everyday's life. We don't differentiate between
work and leisure. That would mean that we're free only a few
parts of our life, the rest of our time we're slaves.
That's not what we want. We organize riots with our acts,
where the people get the energy to fight every day for their
freedom. Kids dance Pogo to our music.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>WAX: Are there any other acts,
producers or labels you like?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">DHR (J.Amaretto): They're a lot of fresh
and new hardcore labels we respect:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Gangster Toons Industries in Paris, Praxis in
London, Cross Fade Enter Tainment in Hamburg, Drop Bass Network
in the States and Bloody Fist in Australia. Sometimes we'll
get some cool stuff from labels and acts like Mille Plateaux and
Riot Beats in Frankfurt, DJ Davyd and Napalm if it's extreme
enough. They're some good records from british guitarbands
lige Huggy Bear, Bikini Kill or Pussycat Trash. Skaterpunk,
Death/Speedmetal and japanese mangas are also a big influence for
us.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>WAX: How do you see the future
for Hardtechno?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">DHR (J.Amaretto): I don't know what you
mean with the specification &quot;Hardtechno&quot;. We don't
use the term &quot;Techno&quot; for our material. We think that
the development of Techno has stopped last year. Techno is dead!
Everyone who's making dance records is making disco records.
I remember that we were listening as teens to industrial punk in
the 80ies cause we hated the disco stuff. We're not with
that, this can't be the future. So we hate today this happy
hardcore stuff from labels like Shockwave or Mokum. This is dance
music for people whose are interested in blind fun only. The
music from acts and labels i named you is reflecting the feelings
that kids have today much much more than any other music at the
moment. It doesn't deal with some cosmic things somewhere up
in the sky open your mind shit. These records deal with problems
we all can identify with. This is the future, even if the system
is trying to fight it down.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>WAX: Discribe the Digital
Hardcore scene in your town!</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">DHR (J.Amaretto): The crowd who supports the
Digital Hardnoize/Hardcore scene in Berlin is getting bigger and
bigger. Producers like Ec8or or Moonraker came from Cologne to
Berlin and they're more and more bands in this town who are
very influenced by Atari Teenage Riot. Our last event with 600
guests at the Eimer - the &quot;Festival of Digital Hardcore
Superstars&quot; with Atari Teenage Riot, Sonic Subjunkies,
Ec8or, Captain Spacesex, Sex-X-Groupies, Joystick Wankerz and DJ
Moonraker was sold out within 90 minutes. It's not easy to
find locations for events like that in Berlin, because the
government fights hard against illegal events in squatts or
warehouses.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>WAX: Do you have a message to
your japanese fans?</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">DHR: (J.Amaretto): &quot;Riot sound produce
riots and the change will come, you'll see!&quot; and
&quot;The government wants us to take drugs like ecstasy and to
feel happy at a rave...never forget that!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b>WAX: Thank you!</b></font></p>
