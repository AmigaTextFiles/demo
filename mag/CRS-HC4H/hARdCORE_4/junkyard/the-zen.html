Did anyone ever tell you to eat shit and die?
<br><br>
If you are an elite turbo hard core motherfucking k-rad cool dude like
myself, then of course that you did; you place a sorry-ass-prick-fucker
where he belongs, and all of a sudden, your mail socket is flooded with
flame mail from the sorry-ass luser, and most of the messages end with
"eat shit and die!!!" or just simply "esad!!!"...
<br><br>
But did you ever stop to think about that sentence, or did you just
automaticaly jump up and replied with similar wishes?
<br><br>
Why don't we all conduct a mental experiment?
<br><br>
Imagine your lunch. There's soup. There's meat. There's vegetables.
There's sauce. There's a cake. There's some salad. There's pasta.
<br><br>
A rather rich meal, wouldn't you say? Fot for a king? For an Emperor,
even!
<br><br>
Right. Now imagine a fork... no, hell, imagine a mixer. Imagine a gigantic
Roseanne's-ass size'd pot. Okay, now dump all the food into the pot. Cover
it with something, so that shit can't fly all over your kitchen.
<br><br>
Now turn the mixer on and stick it into the mash.
<br><br>
Rumble around with the mixer firmly for a while, and when you get an even
mash in the pot, stop. Now leave the whole thing to cool off for a while
(go look at my web page) and when you come back, what?
<br><br>
Your mom just kicked your ass for ruining a healthy nourishing meal? You
dumbass! I told you this is a mental experiment!!! That doesn't mean
_mental_ as in crazy-wicked-wild-ferocious!!! It means 'an experiment
which we imagine, but never actualy do'!!!
<br><br>
Okay, so now, can we continue? Right. When you come back from watching my
web page, take a handful of the gooie mass and shape it into a
sausage-like object. Now leave the thing there to dry, and observe it
carefuly.
<br><br>
Doesn't it look amazingly like shit?
<br><br>
Leave it around for long enough, and it will start stinkin' like shit,
too.
<br><br>
Doesn't this lead you to a simple conclusion? What you eat every day and
consider quality food, is actualy shit in disguise!!!
<br><br>
If you visit my top secret undergound web page, you will be able to see
color photographs that prove that this is all a conspiracy brought on us
by those sorry-ass-prick-fuckers I mentioned earlier, directed at making
us actualy do what they say! I mean, you are gonna die eventualy some day,
so all that remains is for you to eat shit. You are doing it, dude...
<br><br>
SO DON'T GIVE IN TO THEM!!!
<br><br>
NEXT TIME SOMEONE OFFERS YOU SOMETHING TO EAT, TELL THEM TO FUCK OFF AND
GO TAKE DEEP BREATHS AND DRINK LOTS OF MILK!!!
