<font size="4"><b>PROLOGUE:</b></font>
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Days of Making, when Mother Earth was young, and the
Hesitant Moon had only begun it's endless voyage around her, when
the great seas parted to let the fruitful land come in between,
and when the ancient beasts were unleashed upon the surface of the
Earth, a sole figure crawled out of the belly of our Mother Earth.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It called itself "man". Alongside it was another figure,
looking much the same, but with important differences. This one
called herself "woman". And so they were joined, on this Earth,
among the trees and the grass, among the rocks and the seas, among
the grand sky and the land beneath it, joined to roam the surface of
our Mother Earth among beasts of all varieties.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon the grand Maker, Manitu, explained to these creatures
the Great Secret of Procreation, and they began to multiply, and
they created many offsprings, which gathered themselves as a Tribe,
to take on the difficulties of their new found lives. Thus began the
Grand Story, which we all know well by now, the Story that gave
birth to all the little tales that we know, and to the tale which
shall follow. For the Men in this tale of heroic deeds and
thoughtful contemplation, are the Sons of the Great God we all came
to know and respect as Rust, He Who Destroys The Weapons of Careless
Warriors. And so the tale begins...
<br><br>
<font size="4"><b>THE TALE:</b></font>
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warriors of the Tribe sit within the Wigwam of
Conversation. They are all deeply lost in thought, all but the
youngest of them, Fuzzy Carrot, a brave and mighty warrior indeed,
who rode from the distant Northern Planes only to join the Tribe in
their Quests. He is dissatisfied with arrangements that were made
for the second Gathering of Migthy Warriors that was to be held at a
bad time for him. His skwo was to give birth at that time, so he had
to be out in the woods, hunting for food and skins to keep her well
and fit.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuzzy Carrot grunted once, looked up at all the others in
the wigwam, then looked at the exit, where the skin covering it
flapped as it was struck by the strong wind outside. Finaly, after
taking a deep breath, he announced, his voice firm and strong:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fuzzy Carrot not like the arrangement made for the second
Gathering of Mighty Warriors. He has things to do, and can not
compete with the Warriors of this and other tribes, and so he asketh
the Warriors to consider moving the Gathering to some other day,
when Fuzzy Carrot and all those who are busy on that day, and there
are plenty of them, be able to attend Gathering. Howg."
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confused Sponge agreed, and nodding his head wisely, added,
his voice firm and strong:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fuzzy Carrot speak the words of Wise Men, but They Who
Organise say it be good to do it then. They Who Organise also be
They Who Be Asked About Stuff, so Fuzzy Carrot and Confused Sponge
shut up and do as told. Howg."
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Chief was quick to answer, and insightful, as
always, and naturaly, he cared about the needs and feelings of
all his fellow tribesmen. He nodded wisely, shook the dust from his
shoulders, burped twice, loudly, then stood up and announced, his
voice firm and strong:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... all of you go to Hell... Confused Sponge, He Who
Changes Names Too Often, Fuzzy Carrot, Umpah Pah, He Who Has
Short Name, Son of Comanche, Fluffy Hairdo, Send Fast... you all
just sitting around and speaking bullshit saying things be not
good... you could, just for change, sometimes say things is good,
and even do something, from times to times. Yes. Exactly... Do.
Because in tribe like this, no Warrior gives out orders and tasks
in way you would like, just because you not like to think and make
things up! Warriors are all jumping around me and asking why I be
nervous, so there, now you have it, and you can all think about it
little bit for yourselves. Howg."
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuzzy Carrot watched the Grand Chief sit down nobly and
dignifiedly, with merely a small "bump" when he landed on his Great
Warrior Bottom. He felt the pain of the Grand Chief, and could do
nothing else but comfort him. So he announced, his voice firm and
strong:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Woah, the Grand Chief truly speaketh. The Tribe be upset,
and take Grand Chief for drink, Grand Chief relaxes."
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confused Sponge, almost as quick on words as on his tomahawk
in battle, was the first to speak, and to agree with Fuzzy Carrot.
He announced, his voice firm and strong:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes, Confused Sponge think so also, He Who Talks Much
And Says Nothing becomes very frustrated. Confused Sponge think
Grand Chief need new skwo, or some other excitement, Tribe then again
to live in unity and coolness... Howg."
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to reply was Umpah Pah. He still felt a bit of anger to
the Chief since he almost got kicked out of the Tribe, because of
his lack of bravery in battle, but seeing the troubled, wrinkled
face of the Grand Chief, he could feel the pain of the Grand Chief,
and could also do nothing but comfort him. So he announced, his
voice firm and strong:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And maybe Grand Chief missing great amount of Water of
Fire... if Grand Chief want this, when we take his wigwam we
bring great amount... He not worry... Some Warriors even think he
kicks them out of Tribe, and want to burry Tomahawk of War he pull
out just like that..."
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Son of Comanche was next to speak. He listened carefuly
to what Umpah Pah said, and in his wise head, found an error in
these words. He spat in the dirt beside him, cleared his throat, and
announced, his voice firm and strong:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son of Comanche think Grand Chief need two skwo the color of
Sky when sun sets above great lakes which fondle his warrior marbles;
then he be calm... The Water of Fire of Paleface Men is not strong as
the Plant of The Spirits which Noble Warrior of a brotherly tribe
grow in camp a day on horseback away from here."
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude the round, Confused Sponge decided to speak once
again. He farted strongly into the distance, looked at all the faces
in the dimly lit circle of the wigwam, and announced, his voice firm
and strong:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uh! Confused Sponge be great warrior and great traveller.
Confused Sponge travel land and see, and every place the great
brother Moon reaches with His Look, and never in his Warrior
Life does he meet such words that speak wisdom from themselves.
Voah..."
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, the matter was set. Each of the Great Warriors
grabbed his belongings, and went to their wigwams. And when the
Great Father Sun shone upon their noble camp, they all took some
Water of Fire, and lots of the Plant of The Spirits, and gathered at
the wigwam of the Grand Chief.
<br><br>
<font size="4"><b>EPILOGUE:</b></font>
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days of testing their Warrior Power, confronting
the Water of Fire from the Paleface Men and the Plant of The
Spirits, as well as the constant demands of their skwo, they all
came out of the wigwam with happy faces. The Tribe was like one,
again, and harmony was restored. Gatherings shall come and pass, but
the Tribe shall live on as One.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus spake Fuzzy Carrot, the Great Teller of Tales of the
Tribe of Rust, and so may be written down for all future generations
of Warriors to know and to use; may all their clashes be wiped out
like this one; may they always live as One; and may they never
forget the Power of the Plant of The Spirits.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howg.
