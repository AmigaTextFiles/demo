   no  scener is  able to collect  and store thousands  of megs  of scene
   productions ev'ry year, so the very cheapest way to collect all releases
   is a a scene related cd... there are several scene cds around (all of 'em can be
   be ordered  through ZYKLOP MailOrder ;), but now  ZYKLOP  presents the very
   best scene/underground cd ever. it's a dual  cd-rom containing ALL the best
   demos/intros/mags/texts/musix/gfx/tools/... released between late 1995 (the
   party 5) and early 1997 (until february 97)... two cds filled with 1300 mbs
   of the latest high quality stuff will bring you years of fun and
   entertainment and will save you a lot of money and time (no more high
   phone bills;)

   so what do get exactly for your money, you may ask? well, we don't want you
   to buy the cds "blind" without knowing, what's on 'em -  so we included the
   complete file list of both cds in this package. in the files "contents.cd1"
   and "contents.cd2" there are all "file_id.diz" files of cds listed.
   the whole stuff on both cds is UNpacked, so that you can easily run 'n view
   everything directly from cd-rom. sum sysops will prefer zipped releases for
   their boxes, but most users just wanna have some fun without any unzipping.
   well, let's continue with the most important features and a short overview:
