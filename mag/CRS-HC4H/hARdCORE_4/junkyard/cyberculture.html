</center>

<p>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Soledad:</b></font> What is cyberculture? Who makes up cyberculture?
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Douglas Rushkoff:</b></font> Well, to me, cyberculture comes from the
people who've been raised and educated since the advent of
interactive technology. Now you can say cyberculture is from
all the businessmen who bought computers and went on the
Internet and made websites. But to me, cyberculture is not
cyberbusiness, cyberculture is young people. People who were
raised with Nintendo joysticks in their hand, and with
computer mice, and who look at the world differently as a
result.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Soledad:</b></font> How do they look at the world differently? Why
aren't they the equivalent of the youths back in the 60s and
70s?
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Rushkoff:</b></font> Well, I say the main reason is because television
sets have been demystified.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Soledad:</b></font> What does that mean?
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Rushkoff:</b></font> It used to be whoever it was, Walter Cronkite or
whoever, can get into your home, into that magic box, can
actually speak to you and have his picture in your living
room, was doing a magic act. That's a magic act on the order
of what a priest could do with transubstantiation and a
little wafer. I mean, this is magic stuff. But now if you're
actually moving around the pixels yourself on the screen,
you no longer see television as the mystical act. You don't
see it as the gospel truth being piped into your home. It's
just some guy putting up his Super Mario, some guy playing
with a joystick and making his version of the world. And
when you go out on the Internet and exchange all your own
ideas, and move around and navigate through the world
yourself, you don't look at what they say with the same
seriousness anymore. You start to take your own point of
view a bit more seriously.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Soledad:</b></font> What makes you an expert on this cyberculture?
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Rushkoff:</b></font> I think there's no such thing as an expert on
cyberculture. To me a cyberguru is an oxymoron.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Soledad:</b></font> Which is what you're called often.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Rushkoff:</b></font> Which is what I'm called. But you know people
called me a lot of things in high school too, and it turned
out not to be true, I promise you. But it's not true. The
whole idea of cyberculture is that we are all our experts,
that we don't need priests, we don't need gurus to tell us.
Sure, there are a lot of people willing to walk in right now
and be almost like cult leaders, and tell us, "Oh no, the
Internet is a very dangerous place, and the Internet is a
very complex place. And you need a very select group of
cyberguru advisors to tell your business how to go out
there. To make sure your child doesn't go out and masturbate
themselves into oblivion online." Those things don't happen,
it's actually a very safe place and a very easy place to get
around. That's why the mission of a show like this is to
demystify cyberculture, is the whole point. I mean, it's an
easy bias.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Soledad:</b></font> So when you go out as a consultant and get paid big
bucks by big corporations, what do you tell them? I mean,
how do you demystify this audience for them?
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Rushkoff:</b></font> I actually upset them. I usually get hired once by
a big company, a media company to tell them how are we going
to program youth culture. And I tell them, give up. It
doesn't work anymore. Your techniques of coercion and trying
to coerce a culture aren't going to work anymore. What you
have to do is just make a good product, tell us what it does
and charge a good price.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Soledad:</b></font> What! That's ridiculous.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Rushkoff:</b></font> What does that mean? What about brand names? What
about this? So you know I'll go once, maybe twice, and
that's about it. But all I'm really doing is telling them to
stop trying to program us into submission. That it doesn't
work anymore, and it's not serving a positive social
service. And there are people who will hire me to try to
convince their bosses that's true.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Soledad:</b></font> How does the Internet and the Web, all the new
technology we are creating daily, how does that fit into the
concept of demystifying the media, and also the people, Gen
Xers not willing to be programmed?
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Rushkoff:</b></font> Well, I think a lot of it has do with changing the
way we look at technology. Most adults, most people raised
before interactive media, look at technology that acts on
them. It's a way for their boss to make them work more, a
way for someone to give them information. Thanks to this
interactive age we're talking about, people think of
technology now as an extension of themselves, as a way for
them to act on the world. And that's a very different thing.
People like to say this is the Information Age. It's not the
Information Age, it's an interpersonal age. It's an age
where people are beginning to reach out through technology
and resocialize.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Soledad:</b></font> You talk about resocialization in your new book The
Ecstasy Club, which we will do a little plug for right now.
Tell me a little more about the book briefly and the whole
rave scene.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Rushkoff:</b></font> Well, to me the true cyberculture is electronica,
is rave culture. For viewers that don't know, raves are
really gatherings of thousands of young people playing music
made by other young people in their garages with computers
and samples, samplers and synthesizers. And it's people
going to a party and dancing with each other in a giant
group. Really people experiencing in some ways a group
thing, a group spirituality. It's almost like Woodstock,
except without the stage, without the heroes, without
Hendrix playing his guitar, just everyone looking at each
other. And what Ecstasy Club is about is a group of very
idealistic young people who move into a warehouse in Oakland
and start to live this rave lifestyle. Through the Internet,
through drugs, through computers...
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Soledad:</b></font> We won't give away the ending, but in some ways it
doesn't end very well for some of them.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Rushkoff:</b></font> Well, it's kind of a comedy.
<br><br>
<font color="#dddddd"><b>Soledad:</b></font> That kind of leaves it for people to run out and
buy it.
