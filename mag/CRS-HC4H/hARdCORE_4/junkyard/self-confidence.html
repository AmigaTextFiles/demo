<h2><font color=#ff523f>the lack of self-confidence ?</font></h2>

<p>
there is a time when a hardcore scener gets to his 2x age and, usually pops
him self in head with the plain-stupid idea of quitting the scene and
beginning of long-year studying..... BUT.... what happens to the ones who
decide to stay tuned to the scene and their lasting scene-activity ? what
happens to us who still are VERY alive and full of energy ?
<br><br>
u know what i mean...
<br><br>
u remember that idiotic face of the guy who smiles at your module-making....
<br><br>
u know how is it when some jerk-face tell you 'why are you drawing that if
you could just scan it'.....
<br><br>
u remember how it's interesting to fuckup all that stupid-lurking-pea-brained
-brainwashed assholes ?
<br><br>
the question is... what hapens in the age of 21 ?
<br><br>
i'tell you...... <font size="5">N O T H I N G !</font>
<br><br>
the hardcorer stays that way forever.... if he doesn't that means that he never
actually was really one.... got it ?
