<h2><font color=#ff523f>A Brief History of Demo Parties in Yugoslavia</font></h2>
</center>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This info file has been written by the organizers of Yet Another Lame Party
and Scene Strike 1 - two demo parties to be held in Belgrade during the last
week of May 1997 AD. It could be considered an "Errata and Clarifications"
document to the original invitations for these parties. All corrections are
welcome.
<br>

<h2>Past ..zzZZ</h2>
</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, the first demo party was a Transcom party held in Subotica in
October 1990. It was attended by some 30 or so C64 and Amiga sceners from
both Yugoslavia and abroad, notably some members of Chromance (renamed from
FBI Crew to Chromance shortly before the party), Crime, Cross, Deers, Idiots,
Legend, Soldiers, and of course Transcom. There were no competitions, but
several demos were released at the party.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one was the so-called Drunkening, organized by CoRRoSioN in the
night between 02 and 03 of january, 1994. There were 30-40 people gathered
round 6 computers. There were all enemy and CoRRoSioN members and some
members of ex-norml, other guys present were just some friends and
visitors... All in all this wasn't a big party... It was more some kind of
gathering of major groups in order to get know of each other... Party
produced 2 intro's and one broken bed ;>> Released intro's were: party intro
by CoRRoSioN & enemy affects people by ENEMY. All in all nice party, lots of
music & lots of drink! Party proved that alcohol could be very bad for
health.... ;>>>
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rumours of a very small C64 party that was held somewhere in
Croatia even before the Transcom party in Subotica, but these remain
unconfirmed. If you have any information about this party, let us know.
<br>
<center>
<h2>Present (almost)</h2>
</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and fourth will be the first real big and serious parties - YALP
and SS1 of course. They extend an invitation to everyone and they have
competitions and prizes, just like all those great parties you get to read
reports from ;)
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since they will be held within 5 days of each other, we have decided to
allow all competitors to appear with the same works on both parties - yes,
this is something unheard of, but so is the fact that the first two big demo
parties in a country are held almost simultaneously! This solution has its
drawbacks, but it is more acceptable to us than delaying or canceling any of
the parties.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, that goes only for the contributions that fit into some of the
categories on both parties.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organizers of SS1 are focused on Amiga and pc scene, so there aren't
any c64 or other platform competitions announced, but, in the spirit of good
partying, if there is enough interest, those competitions will be organized,
along with the other possible interesting categories that usually fit into
WILD category, like VHS productions and animations.
<br>

<h2>Future (??)</h2>
</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CoRRoSioN is already looking forward to organize the next party in the SS
series, in order to keep up with the scene and help it grow regularly. If
everything goes fine, the second Scene Strike could happen in fall/winter
season. Who knows.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MindEscapE is planning to organize A Yet Even Lamer Party during the early
summer of 1998.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all hope that both parties will become regular annual events, and that
even other, new parties will be inspired by this ice-breaking - maybe even
this year.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll see you in Belgrade before that, anyway.
