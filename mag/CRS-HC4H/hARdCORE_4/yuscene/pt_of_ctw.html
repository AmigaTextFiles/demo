Okay, so, the entire mess started waaaaaay back, so long ago that I
forgot how long ago it actualy was. But it started with my
sister-in-law. Okay, not _actualy_ my sister-in-law, she's just my
girlfriend's sister, but... erm... never mind...
<br><br>
So, she approached me one day and started telling me about this new
"European Youth Association of Serbia" thing, how she is a part of
it, and how they were thinking of making an exhibition about what
they had, badly, dubbed "cyberpunk art". She asked for my help. I
agreed. I was in.
<br><br>
After the first meeting with the EYAS crowd at Dushan's place (he is
the head of EYAS) where we drunk lots of tea and made zero useful
conclusions, Urm, who came along, and myself decided that all we
actualy can do is ask three groups of people for help; CoRRoSioN,
JuiCe and Hyperopia, the only three active demo groups in our
country, at the time. So, we did. I called Domin8r, and soon after
had a face2face chat with him about the potential project,
immediately connecting him with Dushan, and thus loosing most of the
contact with CoRRoSioN's bit of the whole organisation, for the time
being. I called, or was, to be more precise, called by Pain/JuiCe
and had a nice chat with him, although we came to no concrete
conclusions (we never did, after that, and all JuiCe contributed to
the whole event were their entries at Scene Strike 1, as far as I
know) and I contacted two members of Hyperopia, which were, at that
time, in a weird elite-trip, or at least so it seemed, so they sent
me to hell... whatever... their contribution was the same as
JuiCe's, which was much better than none...
<br><br>
Anyway, I connected Dominator with Dusan, and then there was a
loooong period of hybernation. The Student's Protest begun, we were
all very active in it, and the exhibition just got delayed more and
more, some of us even loosing faith, believing that it will remain
just another good idea that never got actualy done. But then, one
day, something started moving. A word here, a word there, I came
onto information that showed how CRS and EYAS are starting to make
preparations for the exhibition... I promptly contacted Dominator,
and then it begun... though I did nothing much at that point, it was
interesting to see how an undefined idea we had months ago grows and
develops into - Creative Tech Week. Finaly, quite a few weeks later,
we had a date set. All we had to do is worry about the tech stuff.
<br><br>
And so we did. To skip the bullshit, on May the 26th, we were all in
Cinema Rex. CoRRoSioN, myself (since back then I wasn't part of tha
posse), EYAS, and a few guys from C-Rex. We dragged lots of
equipment down there, all of CoRRoSioN's Amigas, a couple of their
PC's some of Radio B92's PC's, a couple of machines from S-Soft, and
of course, my faithful "Motherfucker" 286... We connected most of
the equipment that night, and because of minor (ha!) tech problems
went home around 03:00AM that morning. Fun, fun, fun, for the first
night in Rex. Arhimed wasn't laughing, though, and neither were
Dominator and Marcus, poking around (of course) a PC with a gfx card
that was constantly refusing to work the way it should've...
<br><br>
The next day was the Grand Opening. CoRRoSioN and EYAS were supposed
to do a warm welcome speech, but, unfortunately, I wasn't there to
see it, because I had classes I couldn't skip. Those that were
there, say I missed zilch. So, around four I dropped in, and
promptly started coding an ASCII slideshow for my computer, since
there was practicaly nothing else we could display on it, and I had
to justify putting Dominator and Paranoid through so much trouble
getting it down there. An hour or so and one pissed Dushan later, I
had the bloody thing going, and, as it turned out, not a moment too
soon. People actualy started appearing. Visitors!
<br><br>
Squirming around our computers, looking at the pixel slideshows on
the other machines, at my ascii slideshow, at the X-Windows screen
saver that was running on the (only) one Linux box we had because we
found nothing else we could show off on the bloody thing, and a kid
from the neighbourhood playing games on Gyro's A1200. Exciting, and
weird...
<br><br>
Soon after that, we placed all the chairs in front of the video
beam... then, some boring lecture commenced, held by some famous
video-artist that I never heard of, so most of us chilled in the
hallway in front of the projection room... They went on and on and
on and on, and just at the right moment, when we all started getting
bored stiff, it finaly came to an end... We hung around with the
visitors, explaining here and there how some of the stuff we were
displaying is made and what it actualy is, several people were
amazed by my ascii show, of course ;-) and we actualy made a couple
of interesting contacts... hell, interesting is a weak word, one of
the lady visitors seems to have tryied to get me connected with her
sister's daughter, for hell knows what reason (wink, wink, nudge,
nudge... SAY NO MORE!!!)
<br><br>
Anyway, at 08:00 sharp... okay, so, NOT so sharp... well...
actually, at 08:00 dull... it was time to see Akira... I saw it for
the first time, and was like... blasted out of my seat... amazing...
cyberpunk at it's best... The following day we showed Ghost in the
Shell, which was even better, true, hard core cyberpunk, while the
last projection, on the third day, Tetsuo the Iron Man, was the
ultimate perverted heavy duty lost-in-space kickass hell of a movie.
Some of the people hated it, some thought it was just soooooooooooo
funny, and us - we loved it.
<br><br>
Now, I will not bore you with the guests and what they did... all
but one discussion was waaaaaay too boring for me, and quite
sincerely, though I admire what the guys are doing, listening to how
someone tells you about a dude who set up a car without it's doors
onto four concrete slabs inside a house and played a recording of
his grandma explaining how to plant flowers from a tape recorder
inside it, well... you judge for yourself...
<br><br>
Anyway, as I said, there was one interesting discussion... the one
about cyberpunk... Zoran Zivkovic proved what a fuckhead he is,
Vladimir Vesovic was his usual poetic self when talking about
cyberpunk, though his vision differs from the _real_ stuff, there
were a couple of other guys I never heard of, and of course,
PARANOID!!! Who tried to explain to all the people there how
cyberpunks are not awkward people with lots of wires strapped to
them and with their hair cut in an odd shreaded way, walking around
on neon shoes in fluorescent shirts, but normal-looking people who
differ mostly on the inside... not a popular attitude, it proved to
be, but who the fuck cares... anyway, right after all this, some
form of life, with zero intelligence I could detect rose from the
audience and requested to be allowed to speak. This guy deserves a
separate paragraph...
<br><br>
He was a student of electrical engineering, for which I am currently
very ashamed of being his colleague, who has, as he told us, "done a
bit of hacking around"... The poor sorry ass looser probably thought
he was going to impress us all with his tales of visits to the US,
where everyone told him to keep silent about his hacking career,
where people had "virtual money", and where... well, to tell you the
truth, I didn't find one bloody point in all the bullshit he told
us. But...
<br><br>
The big screen behind him... Alex and Dominator by the computer...
as he started talking about his hacking, an odd little bullshit
character appeared on the screen, with the title "I am a hacker,
too..." then, as he talked on about his days in the US, they added
somthing like "Paranoid is a bit nervous... don't give up, Par...
for little money... virtual money..." etc, etc, writing stuff
that made us laugh our asses off, while the poor idiot thought we
laughed at his lousy attempts of being amusing. At the end, as a
culmination, they blasted Terry Gilliam's blank "fat" face from "The
Meaning of Life" on the screen, and everyone died of laughter, which
finaly made the fucking idiot stop his rap. You should have seen him
l8r, walking through the crowd, so fuckin' full of himself...
<br><br>
Anyway, everything went on fine, all three days passed, and the
exhibitionary part of CTW passed without any incidents, everything
went more or less smoothly...
<br><br>
Some remarks should be added here, though, just so that I can do a
bit of gossip... Firstly, I never knew that so little people can get
so pissed at stuff and flame so energetically... secondly, blasting
the 1kW amp to hell was a brilliant idea. We should do that again.
Thirdly, Arhimed and Becha didn't waste any time - they got busy
whenever they could ;-> Fourthly, Dushan wasted a lot of time. =;->>
Fifthly, I discovered the odd relationship Q and Dominator have. No,
nothing sexualy perverted, they just have this sort of
"fight-peace-fight-peace-fight-peace-etc" sort of interaction which,
amazingly, produces lots of results. Though makes for a lot of
"c'mon, guys, why doncha make up already?!" Sixtly, shouts must go
to Marcus, who was there, on the spot, working hard even though he
had some real tough personal problems. Seventhly, I never knew I
could enjoy not sleeping for four nights so much... actualy, six
nights, but that came l8r... Eightly, Simargl, better known as
"PANTA THE AMAZING" was truly amazing and proved to be a true
"Vrhunski Majstor Smora"... (private joke, pay no attention)
Ninthly, the CoRRoSioN animation kicks fuckin' ass... Tenthly... oh,
hell, no, this goes into a separate p'graph...
<br><br>
WE WERE ON TV!!! YEAH!!! All of us, although not at the same time,
and not on the same channel... Dominator and Marcus did some
bullshit for PTC, for which we hated them... gosh, you people have
no idea what idiots the PTC people are... they created such a lousy
ambient, with everything being blank, no background music, fuckin'
STERILE environment, and my only comment was - no wonder noone but
dumbass peasants watches them. Zero style.
<br><br>
Alex and myself were on BK, where he spoke and I acted as a
decoration... the roles were supposed to be reversed on Studio B,
where I should've talked and he should've acted as a decoration, but
he never showed up there, so I did the whole thing solo...
Jurnalists from many papers came by, took interviews, took pictures,
and we were relieved to find that the people from "SK" thought no
good of our exhibition and SS1, because that is *THE* sign that we
had a bloody good thing going...
<br><br>
So, that about covers it... oh, yeah, the illustrations on the walls
were pretty damn cool, done by some of the greatest illustrators in
Yugoslavia... and the illustrators themselves proved to be pretty
cool people...
<br><br>
Akhem, I just remembered, credits must be given to the ladies from
the bakery upstreet from C-Rex, who make kickass pizza-croissants
and chocolate-croi's, as well as great burek... as well as the C-Rex
staff, who helped us out as much as they could.
<br><br>
Now, this should be *IT*... I think I said everything... except that
you should stand by for CTW2, very, VERY soon... with a better look,
and better equipment... Hmh... yeah... okay... nuff bullshit, I
think this article is getting too long already, although I am far
from saying everything I should... If I remember something, I will
DEFINITELY NOT update this article... fuck that... now go check out
my scene strike report, if I got around to writing it already...
