<h3>Prizes</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We weren't too strong on this field, we only found two sponsors who donated
3 CD's each, plus the Ecstasy BBS gave a copy of Ecstasy CD collection as an
additional prize. These were given to the winners of the PC Demo, Pixel,
Photoshop, Rendered, Animation, 4 Channel and Multichannel categories.
Additionally, the winners in all categories got wonderful, exceptional, very
limited series, priceless YALP T-shirts. Don't forget that the entrance was
free :)
<br><br>
<h3>Voting Irregularities</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we had decided to make the entrance to YALP free, the classical "one
ticket, one votesheet" concept couldn't be applied, so we just tried to give
every present person one sheet. However, it wasn't too hard for determined
voters to get their hands on more than one votesheet. In spite of the
remarkable similarity in votes and handwriting of some sheets, we decided to
disregard none of them, as we believe everyone had the same chance to cheat.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain two members of Vortex would have won the 2nd place in the Pixel compo
and the 3rd place in the Photoshop compo, but since we the organizers find
their entries not nearly as good as the other high-ranking ones, we decided to
disqualify them so that we don't get accused for fixing votes. So,
unofficially, they DID win those places, but if we put that official, nobody
would believe us we had not fixed the votes. As of those two - don't worry
about them, they are our groupmates and they'll surely understand.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right there on the spot we had to count the votes VERY fast, so two mistakes
got through: in the 256 Byte Demo category, the TIE fighter by Suicidal/Lucid
was found to have 1 vote more than the second-ranking Fire! by Rep/Titan.
However, during the careful vote-check later, we discovered that those two had
exactly equal numbers of votes. Also, in the Rendered category, Proba 19 by
Trippers was declared winner, but later we found out that Jagodina by Kolja
Tatic had more votes. The lists in this report are corrected, but we cannot
provide the deserved prizes for Rep/Titan and Kolja. We are most terribly sorry
for this, but since the prizes were of little material value anyway (T-shirts
and a CD) we hope those two will forgive us.
<br><br>
<h3>Entry Notes</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ace CD Collection #4 Intro by Hyperopia was not a "previously unreleased
production" and it was submitted way after the deadline; also, the C64 pic
Uriboric Forms by Phantom/Lepsi/Panic was not submitted executable, as it
should have been. However, we accepted these contributions because their
irregularities did little harm and their compo categories weren't really
overcrowded.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N0pe Dope/PaS MaterS really flooded us with all those contributions and got
some 25% of the prizes - totally deservedly. In case you don't understand
Serbian, his ASCII is called "Attack of The Man-Eating Killer Washing Machines
from Mars Two" and the PaS MaterS useless utility is called "Fractal Generator
of Wooded Swiss Mountains with Sound and Atmosphere, but with No Save Option".
<br><br>
<h3>Failures</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five entries were e-mailed to Han Solo, but the disk with them was lost by
another member of the organizing crew (we'll keep his identity secret to
protect him from bomb-attacks), so they weren't shown. These were: a
multichannel module by Spurious/Dead Clown Records, a 256 byte demo by Veljko
Miljanic and two ANSI's and a 256 byte demo by MasterMind. We are particularly
sorry about MasterMind's works, as there were no other ANSI's submitted and his
256 byte demo stood (in our humble opinion) a chance of winning the compo. The
C64 tune Uphill by DM/Victory was not played because of another obscure mistake
caused by the organizers' sloppiness. But what's done is done.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For reasons unknown to us, the C64 tune Lullaby Remake by Trugoy/TempesT
crashed on our compo machine (three times!) and the PC demo The Ultimate
Solution by Demoniac/New Primitives played no music (while it normally plays
some). The animation Inside of st. Dimitrije's Basilicas by Power Bugs, Bell
and Utvara could not be played as our video beam did not support such a high
resolution.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It proved a very bad idea to put all 256 byte demos in one category, as PC
demos were very superior to C64 demos - if there are any 256 byte categories at
the next party, we'll separate them.
<br><br>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We managed to gather a great part of the Yugoslav demo scene at one time and
in one place - far more people than ever before - made them get to know each
other and gave them an unforgettable time. YALP was the first event of its kind
in the history of this country, and we are sure that demo parties will become a
regular event in Yugoslavia in a year or two.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have shown to a kind of "wider" audience - passionate BBS'ers and serious
programmers - what demo scene is all about. We have shown to the people that
demo sceners are not strange people living in faraway countries, but flesh and
blood humans you meet every day.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made it all a fun event; even when things didn't work, we did our best to
make the party worth staying at. For what we hear of the foreign demo parties,
they usually get a lot more boring than YALP was in any moment. We believe
nobody regretted coming to the party.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We managed to promote the C64 scene to the Amiga and PC people who mostly
knew nothing of its existence. We had been supposed to show a nice mix of
different styles of C64 demos, but we only had time to show two of them (one of
which was shown incompletely). Nevertheless, the reactions of the audience to
those demos, to the (only) C64 demo that was brought to the compo, to the C64
grafix and muzax and to Paranoid's "Commodore is dead" statement indicate that
we have succeeded.
