 Howdy mates and thanks for reading this file ehehehe.  We thinked with Norman
about  kind  of  awards,  like  in  "Generation"  was published once.  But, we
doesn't  want totally rip Rockdee's idea.  Firstly "Goldie Berets Awards" were
planned  to  being  an "Beret" business only.  But after hours of speaking and
talking  about positive and negative things, we decided to give permission for
using  scores  in  "Lumen"  -  planned  in  near  future  polish chartmag with
everything,  what  is  concering with poles and polish scene.  Ofcourse we are
also  waiting  for  your  support,  guys  who never visited Poland, in kind of
articles,  votes,  modules, anything.  "Lumen" is magazine maked by poles, but
not only for poles.

  Ok,  now some rules.  Some lines later you could notice a few nominations in
some  categories.   Thinks careful about every guy on this list, in order than
those  awards  must be maximum obiective, and sign him with "x".  But only one
tag  per  every  category, remember!  We will publish scores in first issue of
"Lumen", surely in first half of 1999.  Go to work!
