»CL0:This is some of the response we have
received on the first issue of The
»CL1:Official Eurochart» by »CL1:Depth.» Of course
we have received much more, but
luckily, most of it has been very
positive, so... We are very pleased,
and it certainly gives us the power to
go on for a long time yet... 

»CL9:---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---

»CL8:Well, I just have to tell you what I
thought about the "new" EC........
It is great!
Just as good as the old
STB-days......congrats with a great
debut-issue.
(Zack is doing a noisy applause)
Hope the forthcoming issues will be
just as good, or maybe even
better..?!?            »CL4:-Zack/Sardonyx


»CL6:RNO tries to keep the scene alive; as
Depth does it with the Eurochart;
Go on!!! It's great!!!   »CL7:-CIE/R.N.O.


»CL8:You know what? I'm really heppy to see
"The Official Eurochart" again! This
new number is great and I'm also happy
to found the cool menu GFX by
Pixie/Polka B. who is a great friend
of me!!!      »CL4:-Black Dragon/Honoo+LED

»CL6:First,  let  me  send  my  best
compliments  for issue #28 of The
Official Eurochart. 
You perfectly succed in providing us,
hungry sceners, with a release of an 
old and legendary chartmag, thus 
recreating brilliantly the
whole ancient and wise spirit which
was laying behind it. In few words:
nice job.         
Just some notes, however:
1.I would like, if possible, to
have Eurocharts bootable by disks.
2.Be  a  bit  more careful when it
comes to colors. Sometimes articles
are too much colorful...
3.Rip off "best games chart" and
include "best editor chart".

»CL8:Anyway, I hope things are ok with
Depth, I loved the new Eurochart by
the way, really cool! I'm so glad to
see the Eurochart back!! :)

               »CL6:I think it was very
               good, while it was the
               first issue from Depth!
               Nice to see a new
               Eurochart!
               »CL7:-Qen/Sunshine Prods.

               »CL8:I just read the ec28.
               Very good mag. I must
               say. Very good code.
               »CL4:-Kama/Wrath Designs

               »CL6:I'll give you some
               comments about
               Eurochart you've been
doing right now.  NICE  JOB, MATE! I
really liked it a lot and I think
you've got some of the athmosphere
from the old Eurochart by Crusaders in
your EC!
»CL7:                    -Nuno/ex. Quadriga

»CL8:We would like to dedicate Rage... 
...to Depth, who took 6 months to
release an old issue of the Eurochart.
»CL4:                Napoleon/Rage Main Ed.

»CL6:The Official Eurochart died with the
Crusaders, and for me there's no 
Eurochart anymore.           
»CL7:                            -Groo/CNCD

»CL8:Fine that you are doing Eurocharts 
again... Although some old Crusaders 
members dislike it a bit but the idea 
is cool especially for people like me 
who read Eurocharts since issue 1!!!!

»CL6:KASPER, din store torsk. Vi har mistet
over 100 stemmer fra Homepagen fordi 
dig og Martin ikke hart snakket sammen
og testet det.... :-(((((
