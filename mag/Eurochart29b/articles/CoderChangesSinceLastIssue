»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:
Well... first of all there where »CL6:BIG»
problems with the first release right
before x-mas. The »CL6:major fuckup» was the
fonts that it couldn't load... The
problem was that even so that the two
fonts where present in the Fonts:
directory it still failed. After a
major bug hunting, I located the
precise error to be in the font header
files, because the font names also are
stored internally inside the 2 header
font files (The ?.font files). Ofcause
I wasn't aware of that :-) & since
everybody in Depth who beta-tested it
had the 2 fonts (»CL6:Scala» & »CL6:P0T-NOoDLE»)
it wasn't discovered before it was too
late... Sorry about that one!!!

»CL1:Of other less important bugs, there
was a tiny one in the search routine
so that if you search'ed for a word
that also stood in a clipart filename
it most likely resulted in a guru.
As I overwrite the first char in the
found word with a highlight code used
by my textwriter routine (so it knows
what to highlight:))... Well this
should be fixed now!!!

»CL7:Beside fixing theese bugs. I added
the possiblity of searching though all
the articles in one go, then standing
in the menu (Try it!!! »CL6:I'm proud!!!» It
takes less than a »CL6:second» to search
trough all the articles).

I also added the possiblity of using
the right mouse botton to toggle
between the menu & articles.

»CL1:And finally I updated all my error
handling routines so its less likely
to guru if an error occours...
(EG: Now it dosn't guru if it can't
find a clipart on the harddisk).
»PIC:Raven1»











»CL7:& finally a week later at »CL6:The Party 6»
in Aars, the first issue was released
again!!! (Here we go again:-)).

»CL1:New things added to EC#29 are so far
the possiblity of using some »CLA:color
cycling» in the articles. (Got the idea
from another mag I saw at the party).
»CL7:In the chart section the stats text
has been formatted in a new way giving
space to more text. The stat diagram
has also been coded, so its back like
in the good old days.

»CL1:I can also mention that the code has
grown with around »CL6:500» lines from »CL6:6100»
to »CLB:6600» lines (& more to come :-))
since the before x-max issue...
