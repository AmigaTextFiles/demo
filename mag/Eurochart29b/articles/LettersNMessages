»CL1:Well, let's start with this letter,   
that we got quite quickly after the
release of the 28th issue. Apparently,
»CL7:Gunnar/GFB» isn't all that pleased with
our newssection regarding his group.
I've translated the letter into
English for him! Here we go.


»CL2:Til redaktøren af den nye             »CL1:|»CL4:To the editor of the new
»CL2:Eurochart(tm).                        »CL1:|»CL4:Eurochart(tm).
                                      »CL1:|»CL4:
»CL2:Vi står, efter at have læst den 28.   »CL1:|»CL4:Having read the 28th issue of the
»CL2:udgave af Eurocharten, ret uforstående»CL1:|»CL4:Eurochart, we can't quite account
»CL2:omkring Gunnars Farvebio(tm)'s        »CL1:|»CL4:for the memberlist of Gunnars
»CL2:medlemsoversigt.                      »CL1:|»CL4:Farvebio(tm).
                                      »CL1:|»CL4:




















»CL2:Det påståes, ved følgende citat, at:  »CL1:|»CL4:It is stated, by this quotation :
»CL2:- "MZ1451 er programmør", "Dr. Who er »CL1:|»CL4:"MZ1451 is a coder,
»CL2:musiker", "at Max Planck (ex.         »CL1:|»CL4: Dr. Who is a musician,
»CL2:Messerschmidt og ex. Leisner) skulle  »CL1:|»CL4: Max Planck's" (ex. Messerschmidt & ex.
»CL2:hedde Leisner" og sidst og mest       »CL1:|»CL4: Leisner)" handle is Leisner", and last
»CL2:harmdirende, at "Kollaps er medlem af »CL1:|»CL4: and most outrageous that "Kollaps is a
»CL2:GFB(tm) (iform af programmør og       »CL1:|»CL4: member of GFB(tm) as a coder and
»CL2:grafiker....!)"                       »CL1:|»CL4: graphician"
»CL2:Lad os sige det så kort som, at vi er »CL1:|»CL4:Let's put it as short as this:
»CL2:stærkt enige om at vi IKKE er enige i »CL1:|»CL4:We really agree that we DISagree about
»CL2:ovenstående postulater.               »CL1:|»CL4:the aforementioned assertions
                                      »CL1:|»CL4:
»CL2:Faktum er følgende:                   »CL1:|»CL4:Facts are as follows:

»CL2:- Vi har aldrig haft et medlem under  »CL1:|»CL4:- We have never had a member whose
»CL2:navnet "MZ1451"                       »CL1:|»CL4:  handle was "MZ1451"
»CL2:- Dr. Who betegner vi ikke som        »CL1:|»CL4:- Dr. Who is not considered as a
»CL2:musiker, da hans aktiv ikke ligger    »CL1:|»CL4:  musician, as his skills are not of
»CL2:deri. Han er designer og deltids      »CL1:|»CL4:  that kind. He's a designer and part
»CL2:grafiker. (jvf. State Of The Fart)    »CL1:|»CL4:  time graphician




















»CL2:- Max Planck hedder som sagt Max      »CL1:|»CL4:  (eg. State Of The Fart).
»CL2:Planck.                               »CL1:|»CL4: - Max Planck's handle is Mex Planck!
»CL2:- Lad os starte med et modspørgsmål:  »CL1:|»CL4: - Let's take a contrary question:
»CL2:"Hvornår har Kollaps været medlem af  »CL1:|»CL4: "When has Kollaps been a member of
»CL2:GFB(tm)?? Og kan man kalde ham        »CL1:|»CL4: GFB(tm)? And could you call him
»CL2:grafiker???"                          »CL1:|»CL4: graphician??"
                                      »CL1:|»CL4:

»CL0:Well, Gunnar, I'm very sorry that some
of our news turned out to be
unreliable. I hope that this was a
stand-aloner. And your corrections are
hereaby made public.















»CL2:And a little short note to »CL8:Groo/CNCD»:
Thank you for slagging us off. We'll
remember it, don't worry.

»CL4:To »CL8:Jef/Movement»: Yes, it is possible,
that you are the best coder around,
but you are »CLA:NOT» allowed to vote for
yourself or your group for that
matter.

»CL2:To »CL8:Alex-Uyanik/TRSI&Fairlight»: Thanks
for your little letter. It's nice to
hear from some of the really old
sceners who know, what the Scene is
all about! You should consider
joining the Scene again :-)

»CL4:To »CL8:Siegel/TRSI:» Interesting coders,
you know. I've never heard of any
coder in the Scene that used his
own German name as handle. Anyway, I
included them in the chart, but I'm
afraid they didn't make the best
twenty :-)

»CL2:To »CL8:Alta/Blue House» : Thanks for your
little update about your career in
»CL3:FunCom». I'd really like to see a demo,
if you decide to make one. It'll be
great, I guess!!

»CL4:To »CL8:Miracle/1oo%»: I'm sorry, but »CL5:ASCII-
artists» will not be included in the
»CL7:Eurochart» unless a massive amount of
people suddenly wants it. There IS
only room for »CL5:twelve categories», and
that will never be changed!

»CL2:To »CL8:Azazel/TBL» and »CL8:Antibyte/Scoopex»:
Thanks a lot for some nice pics and
help on the who is who - thing! I hope
you like the result - I had to cut
them quite a bit down in order to make
all this fit :-(


           »PIC:Shade4»




















»CL4:To »CL8:Napoleon/Eremation»: I have to admit
that I don't get why you have to be
rude against other people for no
reason. Let's not start a war. The
Scene has had far too many of those
already.

»CL2:To »CL8:Dr.Dreyer/Blasphemy»: Thanks a lot
for a nice and long partyreport. I
hope that you like the result. I find
it quite.. Well: Great!

»CL4:To »CL8:Offa/TBL»: I guess that you are
aware that I had to discard the most
of your votes. But thanks anyway!
Hehe :-)
