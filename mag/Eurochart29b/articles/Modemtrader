»CL8:»BIG:Interview with a m0ðEm7RaDe®
»SML:»CL9:-------------------------------------- 
»CL4:         by Curt Cool/Depth

»CL0:This time, we at »CL8:obSceneities» have
decided to interview one of the more
sinister characters of the scene, at
modemtrader, who has decided to stay
anonymous, since he is afraid of being
busted by the police. Maybe this
interview is a bit hard to understand,
but then again, »CL9:life» is not
necessarily supposed to be easy...

Anyhow, if you are no fan of »CL4:e|¿7e»
language, it is heighly recommendable
that you go to the »CL4:bottom» of this
article to find a translated version,
translated by »CL9:Depth »CL8:obSceneities

»CL2:CC: Hi there! Now the interview
starts, in case you wondered...
»CL4:E7: What?
»CL2:CC: Oh, sorry... Hi there, now the
interviews starts...
»CL4:E7: oh... that's funny...
»CL2:CC: well. what do you do on the
scene?!
»CL4:E7: I use my mothers phonebill to
trade a lot...
»CL2:CC: Oh. aren't your mother angry at
you, when she gets that phonebill??
»CL4:E7: Well, she hasn't got it yet, I
usually throw it away before she sees
it...
»CL2:CC: Oh... Don't you think that the
phone company will be somewhat
angry???
»CL4:E7: No...
»CL2:CC: Just a little??
»CL4:E7: Okay, just a little... But why
would that matter, I'm a cool trader
man! Cool wares!
»CL2:CC: How old are you?
»CL4:E7: 14
»CL2:CC: Going to school?!
»CL4:E7: Yes! But the other dudes and GIF's
have some trouble understanding me...
»CL2:CC: Sorry, erm, GIF's? Do you mean
girls? (sick dude!! HAN FÅR FOR LIDT!)
»CL4:E7: Yes! Of course... That is an old
word you are using there...
»CL2:CC: Sure... Anyhow, I can't stand
talking in this language anymore, so,
I'd better stroll along now I guess...
»CL4:E7: What language??
»CL2:CC: (running for the door)
    Never mind, I have a date....
    BYYYYEEEE!!
»CL4:E7: What was those last two words?
»CL2:CC: (on the way downstairs, meeting a
     few friends from the phone-
     language police)
     nooooothing!

»CL0:I must admit that I don't hope that
all modemtraders are like that,
otherwise I can't help wondering what
this world is coming to... -CC
