»CL4:         by Curt Cool/Depth

»CL8:CC = Curt Cool
»CL6:PO = Party-organizer, »CL7:who,
surprisingly, wants to be anonymous.
»CL8:CC: Hello there. Thanks for letting us
interview you!
»CL6:PO: Oh, no problem.
»CL8:CC: That's quite an impressive »CL4:plane»
you have got there... Have you earned
a lot of money by arranging »CL4:THE PARTY»
series?
»CL6:PO: Certainly not. Not a lot anyway,
but I suppose that we get by...
»CL8:CC: Gee, is that your »CL4:Ferrari»?
»CL6:PO: Well, suppose it is. But it's only
rented. 
»CL8:CC: For how long?
»CL6:PO: Quite along time. Eternity,
that is, which I need not tell you is
a heck of a long time...
»CL8:CC: Hey, let's get to the point! How
did you get the wonderful idea of
holding demoparties? 
»CL6:PO: Since the dawn of the scene,
parties were held, so it's not really
our idea. We were just the first to
»CL7:commercialize» it.
»CL8:CC: Oh. Are you also involved in
arranging the other big European
parties? I mean, the »CL4:Gathering» and the
»CL4:Assembly»? And maybe the »CL4:Symposium» now?
»CL6:PO: (whispers) Don't tell this to
anyone, but it is actually the »CL7:same
person» who arranges all of those and
scores all the profit. Don't write
this, the sceners must not know about
it.
»CL8:CC: Is that person you?
»CL6:PO: Not a chance.
»CL8:CC: Sure.
»CL6:PO: Certainly! Stop harrassing me, I
am just a poor organizer -
»CL8:CC: »CLA:POOR?»
»CL6:PO: Quite poor. After all it was me
who agreed to do this interview, and
if you don't...
»CL8:CC: Ah, come on, let's talk about the
party instead then.
»CL6:PO: (phew!). That's better.
»CL8:CC: Well, is it very hard to arrange a
big party like the »CL4:TP»'s?
»CL6:PO: For some of the people behind it,
it certainly is, like the helpers
using their spare time for arranging
for a meagre sum, but for the
professionals, no, we're used to it.
»CL8:CC: What do you »CL4:do» at the parties?
»CL6:PO: Well, I sit at the information and
drink a lot of »CL7:coke», and sometimes I
»CL7:sleep» a bit. You see, it's very »CL7:hard
work» to coordinate the work of the
helpers using their spare time...
»CL8:CC: Oh, you're a coordinator?
»CL6:PO: Well, so to speak, yes.
»CL8:CC: I heard some rumour about some
organizers »CL4:drinking» all the »CL4:booze» they
»CL4:confiscated» AT the party?
»CL6:PO: I know nothing about that.
»CL8:CC: Well... Okay, thanks for the
interview.
