»CL8:This Easter a German party, the
»CL4:Symposium Mekka» is held in a small
German town called »CL4:Fallingbostel.»
Travelling down here by train, one
quickly gets the expectation that the
party will be held in a »CL4:small barn» in
a »CL5:huge »CL4:German forest. »CL8:This is luckily
not the case. Actually, the party
takes place in a nice tempered hall
with room for about »CL4:500 people». And
500 people have definately come to
this place to have a good time.
Furthermore - about 7 »CL4:drunken Germans»







have met up to break some bottles and
make a lot of noice. But in my opinion
the organizers are handling things
well until now. I've only been here
for about twelve hours, but I really
feel that this party is a nice one and
I think that the compos will be great.
Unlike many parties of today, I don't
feel that the mood of the party is
sitting in front of a screen playing
»CL4:doom» or watching some »CL4:Mpegs» or
whatever.

   »CL8:The people that have showed up are
   mainly Germans of course, but I'd
   say that about »CL4:20 Danes» have met up
   as well. Other minorities present
   are the C64-owners. I've seen about
   »CL4:5 C64's». And frankly - the amiga is
   getting to be a minority as well.
   The Amiga/PC ratio is as low as
   »CL5:1:3». However, as I've said before,
   this doesn't seem to affect a
   generally »CL4:cozy» and »CL4:relaxed party-
   mood». All in all, my general
   impressions of this party so far
   are of »CL4:positive» kind. Hope to see
   you next year - in a small barn in
   Germany :-)
