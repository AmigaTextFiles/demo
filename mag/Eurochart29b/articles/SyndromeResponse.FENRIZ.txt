»CL0:Hello everyone, most of you probably
don't even know me. So why the hell do
I write an article. Well it is a
response to the »CL8:Hardcore» article in
»CL1:Eurochart 28». And I think »CL8:Tricktrax»
has overseen what the core of the
scene is. And why we keep on making
demos. We keep making demos for fun,
and some of us to shock others.
»CL1:Syndrome» was formed because of »CL1:Tenshu»
not being able to express himself when
he was in »CL1:Apex». So he, »CL1:Bosco» and
»CL1:Codac», left to form »CL1:Syndrome». So that
is what »CL1:Syndrome» is all about.

But lets get to the Demo, »CL1:Hardcore».
Just to make one thing clear, it
»CLA:RULEZ!!».. And if you havent seen it
then get it. Okay you (»CL1:Tricktrax») said
that it was Satanic. Hmmm where did
you see that. The GFX are not satanic
in any way, just that they include a
beast and freak doesn't really show
much of the satanist side really, or
maybe you need to get some information
on what satanism is. Satanism is a
religion. And nothing else. The
burning of a cross, it is not
satanism, it's a form of expression.
That the theme of the demo has
something with death, yes I would
agree with that. But to be correct the
theme is more of suicide; but then
what is wrong with that. Aren't you a
bit tired of all the demos that are
realesed these days. Only happy people
in all of them and I think that »CL3:sucks».
No real demos have been made for us
who like the more gloomy side of
things.
The mod is not just big samples, the
tune is rather good I would say, you
just don't like the style, »CL1:Tricktrax».
Just as I don't like techno. Maybe you
would write the same thing about the 2
hip hop demos from »CL1:TP6». You have to
respect that some sceners don't like
the same things as you do. To go with
the flow and follow the masses sucks.
The code of »CL8:Hardcore» is among the best
ever seen this year, in my opinion.
Every one is a bit tired of the torus
these days. So »CL1:Codac» included a human
skull, whom I would belive »CL1:Tricktrax»
did not like, as it represents death.
But let's get real people: we are all
going to die some time, »CL1:Ghandy» is
first. So why not include it in our
demos. 




»CL1:Tricktrax» mentioned the part with some
porno. Yes, it includes a nice little
mpeg anim, with s&m. And I don't
really see the problem with that as
most sceners have loads of porno pics.
And if you look at the PC scene; well,
they don't have anything else.


But all in all the demo is great as
the music, graphics and effects suits
each other good. So I don't think
»CL1:Tricktrax» had any rights to say it
isn't worthy the label »CL4:"DEMO"».

But to finish this article. I would
just say that »CL8:Tricktrax»'s article is
only based upon »CL3:ignorance». Get a grip
dude..............»CL9:Fenriz/Cider»

»CL6:A litlle note to »CL5:Ghandy/Gods». I'm not
going to kill you or anything, since I
said that you would be the first one
to die. But I think you are the oldest
scener.»
