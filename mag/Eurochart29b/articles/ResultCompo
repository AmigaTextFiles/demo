»CL0:Yes, we have chosen the best clip-art
of this issue, and although we did not
get quite as many contributions as we
might have wished for, we still got
»CL7:21 contributions» for the clip-art
competition!
Thanks to »CL2:Shade», »CL4:Zack», »CL6:Raven», »CL8:Dr.
Zulu», »CL2:Jamsam» and »CL4:Black Dragon» for
those!
Anyhow, the winner of one lifetime
subscription to the Eurochart (»CL1:+ some
weird special prizes from the
obSceneities crew») is:

                Nice, innit?

                Anyhow, check out this
                issue's »CL1:module
                competition», and do
                not let the fact that
                we do not have a
                clip-art competition
                in this issue stop you
                from sending us a lot
                of clip-art!
