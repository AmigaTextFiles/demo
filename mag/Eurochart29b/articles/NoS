»CL4:             by Curt Cool

»CL0:As the more observant of you might
have noticed, there is »CL9:no "S"» in
»CL1:Eurochart», but obviously many people
seem to think that this is the case.
Maybe you just cannot spell or think
that we speak a strange tongue, where
the letter »CL8:"S"» is not pronounced, but
I strongly doubt that this is the
case.

»CL1:The Official Eurochart» has always been
called the "»CL8:Eurochart»" instead of the
"»CL1:Eurochart»»CL9:s»", as the more avid
followers of your ever ongoing
favourite chart will notice if they
care to load in the »CL8:Crusaders
Eurochart #1» (»CL1:november 1989, notice
the complete lack of "»CL9:s»"'s in the
name»CL0:) and when done, check out the
»CL1:Static Bytes "Official Eurochart #27"»
(»CL1:may 1995, again, there are
definitely »CL9:no "S"»'s in the name»»CL0:).

So there you go, the »CL1:Eurochart» will
always be the »CL1:Eurochart», and, as the
more perceptive of you out there
should have noticed by now, there is

»CLA:NO "S" IN THE OFFICIAL EUROCHART NAME»

...think you should understand by
now...
