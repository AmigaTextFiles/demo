                                Installation
                                ------------

    You'll  need  to install the XPK package first to use this library.  The
XPK  package  should  be available on most Bulletin Board Systems, so try to
get it there.

    If  you already have the XPK package installed, then to add this library
to  your  system  simply  copy  the  xpkSQSH.library from the 68000 or 68020
subdirectory to your LIBS:Compressors/ dir.



                                Description
                                -----------

    SQSH  is an XPK packer sublibrary which implements an optimized LZ based
algorithm combined with a 8 bit delta compression algorithm.

    This packer was especially made for packing 8 bit Samples and ProTracker
style  modules.   It's  NOT  a lossy compression library, so NO quality-loss
will occur when packing Samples with this library.

    SQSH  is  pretty fast at decompression (300K/s on A3000) so is very well
suited  to compress Modules and Samples since these will typically be packed
once  and  unpacked  many  times.  It's slow at compression (25K/s on A3000)
mainly  because  every  part of the file has to be checked twice to see what
the better compression method would be.

    In  order  to  achieve  reasonable  compression  of other types of files
(Executables,  Textfiles) this packer will scan a long range (about 20K) for
identical  byte  sequences and if it finds any, it outputs offset and length
instead  of the bytes themselves.  Scanning such a long range for duplicates
is  a  CPU-intensive  process.   I have tried to make it as fast as possible
(about 25K/s on A3000) but NUKE proves it can be done faster :-)

    In  the archive also is included a 68000 version of this library.  Sorry
all  you  68000  users  for  the long delay, but I only received one message
asking  me  for  a  68000  version.   It was Edmund Vermeulen who eventually
convinced me to program the 68000 version.


                                 Statistics
                                 ----------

    As  I  don't own a A3000 and xBench, I cannot give results which you can
compare  with  the  other XPK libraries.  But I can offer you some results I
got  on  my own machine (that is a A2000 with a 22Mhz 68030 GVP with 6 Mb of
60ns 32bit ram)
