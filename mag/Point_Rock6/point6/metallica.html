<H1>Metallica : Poor Recording Me Summer Tour 1997 - Kiewit ( Belgium )</H1>

<P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>

What a day my friends !!! To close the first day of the Pukkelpop festival 1997, Metallica was here
for one of their 3 european dates... The gig has been worth the wait.

<P>

After the show of Bush, we saw the roadies install the material for Metallica. I was suspecting that
the stage would be to small to support all the set from last tour, and when I saw the simplistic
scene they were building, I thought that the gig would be, errr, simple !

<P>

After near more than 1 hour, the band came finally on stage with the traditional <I>So what ?</I> played
in a fury. I don't have to say that when you are crushed on the security fence, its' hard to resist and I
have not stayed there too much. I was nearly front stage and it was VERY hard to breathe !!<BR>
So, I manage to get a little more on the back after three songs in hell :-)

<P>

In fact, it was a good idea to get there, because I've had the opportunity to shoot the members of
the band and have very good pictures !!! Look at some gifs on this article.<P>

So, Metallica has played 4 songs of the controversed <I>Load</I> ( you will find at the end of
this article the complete set-list ) but also, and it was an exclusivity because I never heard this
one, a new song from <I>Reload</I> !!! I thought they'd play DEVIL DANCE, but it was FUEL... It's a very
good song and it's quite speedy !<P>

James Hetfield spoke not too much on this gig. He said at the begining "<I>Good evening, we are
Metallica, you are the public, we play Heavy Metal</I>". So the place was not for long speeches. They
were there for music.<P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">

Kirk Hammett has yet again changed his look. This time, it was an undefined hair-cut because they
were cutted in a strange way ( there was a hole in the middle ) !!!<P>

They have also played classical songs like <I>Master of Puppets </I>, <I>One</I> ( but without
the fireworks ), <I>For Whom The Bell Tolls</I>...<P>

The show was very hot and I broke my voice singing with them. In front of me, there was 2 young
boys ( mor eor less 10 years old ) headbanging like crazies : the one who says that Metal is dead
is a LIAR !!!
<BR CLEAR="ALL"><P><BR><BR><BR>

During my "photo session", James Hetfield saw me with my camera wanting to shoot him. What a surprise
when he waited 'till the picture was taken and posing with his guitar for ME !!! I can't resist to
show you this picture.<P>

After it, I went back to rejoin my friends and finish the show headbanging like deranged ! The sound
was a little more bad there but it was quite OK.<P>

To end up their gig, Metallica played <I>Stone Cold Crazy</I> ( a cover of Queen ), <I>Creeping Death</I>
 ( Die ! Die ! Die ! ), <I>Battery</I>. Those 3 songs one after the other are killing, believe me !<P>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<P>

After the show, it was time to drink something because our throats were completely dry !
