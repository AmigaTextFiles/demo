<A NAME="bio"><H2>A short biography</H2></A>

Since the release of their first album <I>Herzeleid</I> in 1995, the band meets a lot of success
in their natal country, Germany. The critics are very good indeed and they have sold more than
400.000 copies of Herzeleid.<P>

Despite this success, the band has to wait that David Lynch heard them and decided to use 2 of their
songs on the soundtrack of his new movie <I>Lost Highway</I> ( Soundtrack which contains songs of
Nine Inch Nail, Marylin Manson, David Bowie... ).<BR>
The result is not long to come : Rammstein get more and more known outside Germany and people begins
to become interested.<P>

The first album is on-sale in Europe since a moment now and the second album <I>Sehnsucht</I> has been
released the 13th of october.

The power of their music is amazing. First of all, Till Lindermann sings in german with a very deep
voice and has nothing to envy to Peter Steele. The way he sings is quite martial ( and the language
used fits very well to that ).<BR>
The music uses samples and keyboards and the mix with ultra heavy guitars is strong.<P>

The band offers also a good visual show when their are on-stage. Their use a different pyro-technic
effect for every song : once you see the singer wearing a burning jacket while he's singing, another
time he comes with flame-thrower, or uses a coloured smoke generator which are used on planes in
aeronautic shows...<BR>
You must see them one time live because their very good. The fire is everywhere and the music ultra
violent.<P>
