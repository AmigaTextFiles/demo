I have discovered this band recently as I was going to a gig of Vanden Plas at the
<A HREF="http://users.skynet.be/sky80229/66/">Spirit of 66</A>. The bass player of Vanden Plas has had
an accident and it was not possible for the band to play. So they asked to some friends to come here
and play to replace them.<P>

Avalon is a Melodic Progressive Hard Rock band coming from Germany. The gig they played last 1st
November 1997 at the Spirit of 66 has pleased me so much that I decided to buy they second directly
after the show. I was out of cash and I have not had the opportunity to buy both albums !!!<P>

Back at home, I listend this album and I found it absolutely fabulous. If you like melodic Hard Rock,
this one is for you.<BR>
The guitarist is very talended, the singers sings high, the melodies are easy to remember, all is
here to have a good album.<P>

You can find 3 instrumentals on this album, the cover has been drawn by a belgian artist ( I am
belgian, so I want to state it ! ) and it has been produced Charlie Bauerfeind ( who has also
produced albums of Angra, Gamma Ray... )

<P>
