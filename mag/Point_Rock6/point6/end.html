<H1>Last words</H1>

<P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>

That's it ! You have reached the end of the sixth issue of Point & Rock. <BR>As in issue 5, I have
put a lot of efforts in the design of the mag which I think has found his definitive layout.

<P>

All I have to do now is to improve again the quality of the mag itself. It's not that my work is
crap ( and you don't seem to think like that when I read your comments in my guest-book )  but
everything can always be better.

<P>

I want to thank everyone who took of his precious net-time to read me, to vote and to sign my guest-
book. It proves that my work is not completely in vain. Hey ! I like it so I will continue my job.

<P>

So : Point & Rock has 1 year now. I think that next time I will recompile the charts from all
previous issues to find out the best 25 albums and the best bands you prefer ( because the charts
where established with YOUR votes ).

<P>

Remember that there is a mailing list to be informed when the next magazine is out. If you want
to be added in this mailing list, just send an e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:nr18@geocities.com">me</A>.

<P>

Well, this time is really over, see you all in issue 7 !!! It should be out in january 1998...

<P>

7 deadly sins,<BR>
7 ways to win,<BR>
7 holy paths to Hell<BR>
And your trip begins<P>
