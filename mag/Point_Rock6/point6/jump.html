<H1>Jump : A tribute to Van Halen - Spirit of 66 ( Verviers / Belgium )</H1>

Ahh ! <A HREF="http://users.skynet.be/sky80229/66/">The Spirit of 66</A> !!! What would I do without this
bar ??? It's a place where you can discover a lot of things and amongst them, tribute bands. I have seen
there tributes to Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, Kiss, Queen and many more...

<P>

This time, it was the turn of Van Halen to be invited. Well, Van Halen or Jump ??? I don't remember
now because the imitation was quite good. Especially the singer who was really excentric, just like
<I>David Lee Roth</I> !!! He was moving like him, getting in the crowd to excite the girls...

<P>

And while we're speaking about Magic Dave, the band only played songs on David Lee Roth's era...<BR>
All the classics has been reviewed from Jump, Take Your Wikey Home, Pretty Woman, Running With The
Devil, Jamie's Crying, Dead Or Alive... and I forget so much !!!

<P>

The show was quite calm in the first part ( I mean the public was not dancing ) but in the second
part of the gig, all went crazy. People were singing, dancing. The band invited some girls on stage
when they played Pretty Woman. All guys were happy ! They were soooo nice !

<P>

The wanted to finish the gig with <I>Jump</I> and the reaction has been quick !!! WE WANT MORE !!!
So they came back and played other songs.<BR>
Really good !!!

<P>

I have passed a very nice evening, remembering the good old days, when I began to listen Hard Rock...<BR>
MMM, memories, memories...

<P>
