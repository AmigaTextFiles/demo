<A NAME="top"><H1>Lyrics : Bruce Dickinson - Skunkworks</H1></A><P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>

Skunkworks, the third solo album of Bruce Dickinson ( mmmh, nearly solo because he had a band
called Skunkworks... which has been fired before the recording of his last album : Accident Of
Birth ) has a strange lyrics booklet : everything is written upside-down in the way you need a
mirror to read the lyrics.

<P>

So I took my mirror and retranscripted all I saw into readable words. Here they are, for your
purpose !

<A NAME="Space"><H2>Space Race</H2></A>

Yes Yes I'd launch into the rising sun<BR>
My living breath is measured<BR>
Every step is done<BR>
Fare you well my friends<BR>
See you down the line<BR>
Yeah Yeah<P>

I don't belong to nation state or dying race<BR>
I have my prejudice<BR>
With you my religion's in space<BR>
So have a little respect<P>

Why are we running in this space race ?<BR>
Why are we acting like we own the place ?<BR>
Just want to feel the starlight on my face<BR>
Reach out my hand and touch beyond...<P>

Yes Yes I'd float around till gravity's end<BR>
Unity is coming singular again<BR>
See you then my friends at the end of time<BR>
Yeah Yeah<P>

Secret knowledge Science logic all are gone<BR>
Nothing left but burning up into the sun<BR>
On a cosmic beach I'll see ya there<P>

<A NAME="Edge"><H2>Back From The Edge</H2></A>

A silent river flowing black<BR>
Strange attractors no turning back<BR>
Present danger I recall<BR>
That pins my senses to the wall<P>

Back from the edge where the darkness has fled<BR>
And I'm swimming in light and I'm falling...<BR>
Falling from the edge<BR>
Back from the edge<P>

I felt from grace and that's a fact<BR>
I still have urges that I fight back<BR>
Caid decisions wear me thin<BR>
Kill yourself... begin again<P>

Back from the fear<BR>
That you're not worth a damn<BR>
Throw yourself into light<BR>
And the rush as you spin from the edge...<BR>
Back from the edge...<P>

Now and then I wonder where the faces<BR>
From my childhood have gone ?<BR>
Like father like son in your bones<BR>
It lives on glowing shadows<P>

Back from the edge<BR>
Back from the edge<P>

<A NAME="Inertia"><H2>Inertia</H2></A>

These are the pictures<BR>
These are the feelings from the front line<BR>
Living in silence<BR>
Feeling the deafness like heavy smoke<P>

Smiling with strangers<BR>
Couting the days<BR>
Like a spring called up inside<BR>
Welcome to your future<BR>
Welcome to your book of lies<P>

Fingers crawl through pages<BR>
Nothing changes living here...<P>

Inertia<BR>
No wish to move at all<BR>
Inertia<BR>
Everything's a stone wall<BR>
Inertia<BR>
History lets you die<P>

A ragged pile of silent accusers<BR>
Smell the blood of strangers here<BR>
No eyes, no ears, no smell, no taste<BR>
The mouth of the maggot is full of this place<BR>
Murdered conscience the pressure is crushing heads<P>

Like paper lanterns now<BR>
Unbreakable grip a dead hand<BR>
Driving us forward to the end<BR>
Kicking through the traces<BR>
A thousand years from now<P>

Inertia<BR>
No wish to think at all<BR>
Inertia<BR>
Everything's a stone wall<BR>
Inertia<BR>
History lets you die<P>

<A NAME="Faith"><H2>Faith</H2></A>

You knew I wouldn't go<BR>
That's why you threatened me... would I stay ?<BR>
Said I was sick and 'd be alone<BR>
Said my mind was not my own, I didn't run<BR>
You crawled up on your knees<BR>
A victims pretty please<BR>
Would I stay ? Would I stay ?... and I stayed<P>

How many more times, till I breakout<BR>
From that guilty mess<BR>
You taught me to hate to love you<BR>
That's because you love to hate yourself<P>

I wish it had a happy end<BR>
Like the fairy tales pretend there can be<BR>
But things are not the same<BR>
When your life love was a game<BR>
Of make believe<P>

You got everything you want<BR>
But not everything you need<BR>
Ant it's true... you receive... what you achieve<P>

How many screaming fights...<BR>
Tears of rage until it ended<BR>
How many more times...<BR>
Till I say who I am<BR>
And don't pretend<P>

<A NAME="Solar"><H2>Solar Confinement</H2></A>

Trapped inside a web of fiery gravity that fuels all our needs<BR>
Chaotic energy that sucks the life from H to HE<BR>
All life withers in the sun<BR>
I deny what I have done<P>

Spend my days and nights<BR>
In roaring walls of crimson fire<P>

Solar confinement ( 3 times )<BR>
Solar distress flares<P>

I've slept with many strangers<BR>
So fission fusion fission makes good senses<BR>
Where I laid my head, my troubles<BR>
I put down to experience<P>

It's cold and lonely in the sun<BR>
I deny what I have done<P>

Spend my days and nights<BR>
In roaring walls of crimson fire<P>

A lonely boy sits in his room<BR>
His curtains hide the sun<BR>
Confess to what you've done<BR>
And no one understands<P>

<A NAME="Dreamstate"><H2>Dreamstate</H2></A>

Well you bred me<BR>
Well you fed me<BR>
Well you made me what I am<P>

Something for nothing<BR>
Good for nothing<BR>
Well....<P>

It's a dreamstate, a dreamstate<BR>
To kill me with kindness you'll just have to wait<P>

You say I'm nothing<BR>
You say I'm nothing<BR>
Never gonna be something, well then...<BR>
That's the life for me<P>

Your expectations... your reservations<BR>
Aw... c'mon please...<P>

It's a dreamstate, a dreamstate<BR>
You bought into the vision so you don't have to wait<BR>
A dreamstate of bliss, a dreamstate of bliss<BR>
A dreamstate...<P>

Now I'm standing up here before the Judge<BR>
Juries got their heads where the sun don't shine<BR>
Everybody's lying on my case, they're lying on my<BR>
Lying on my...<BR>
Lying on my...<BR>
Lying on my case<P>

Eyes above me, eyes above me<BR>
Never realised there was someone else in here<BR>
No resolution, and no conclusion<BR>
Do I believe ?<P>

In a dreamstate, a dreamstate<BR>
You fell for it sucker, you fell for the bait<BR>
A dreamstate of bliss, a dreamstate of bliss<BR>
A dreamstate...<P>

<A NAME="Truth"><H2>I Will Not Accept The Truth</H2></A>

I will not accept the truth ( 3 times )<BR>
That I'll never get there no way<P>

I must not push forward... No ( 3 times )<BR>
Because I'll never get there<BR>
Never get there... no way<P>

I will not believe your lies ( 3 times )<BR>
You say I will never get there<P>
Never get there<P>

Well hold on... hold on... hold on<P>

I will not accept your truth<BR>
I will not accept your lies<BR>
I will not acknowledge pain<BR>
I will survive and live again<P>

Coming back now, rising up now<BR>
Hold on ( 6 times )<P>

I will not accept your truth<BR>
I will not accept your truth<P>

<A NAME="Machine"><H2>Inside The Machine</H2></A>

I've got myself a widget<BR>
A gizmo with wires<BR>
And Martian intent yeah<P>

Strange face of beauty<BR>
That's my machine<P>

It blinks and stares right at me<BR>
Sees nothing but in its wires<BR>
A strange thing of beauty<BR>
That's my machine<P>

You won't believe what it can do<BR>
It tells me things I never wished I knew<BR>
Like the mirror when you ask<BR>
It tells you true<P>

Inside the machine, the web has got you now<BR>
Inside the machine, yeah<P>

I's strap my DNA to it<BR>
A living device, the light of my life, yeah<BR>
Strange thing of beauty<BR>
That's my machine<P>

I sit and we crackle with static<BR>
It makes no sense to have experience when<BR>
A strange thing of beauty<BR>
That's my machine<P>

Inside the machine, we're looking for control<BR>
Inside the machine, we're part of it somehow<BR>
Inside the machine, yeah<P>

Inside the machine, the web has got you now<BR>
Inside the machine, you're part of it somehow<BR>
Inside the machine, we're looking for control<BR>
Inside the machine, yeah<P>

<A NAME="Headswitch"><H2>Headswitch</H2></A>

What would induce you to swear your allegiance to God tonight ?<BR>
Joined at the nip to a million volt switch of the light, alright ?<BR>
You want to find out what the planet's about ?<BR>
Falling from grace leaves a cool empty space in the sky<P>

Your eyes are black as they see the red ball of the sun, but they're blind<BR>
Dribbling with come as the volts start to arc through your mind<BR>
It's cruel but it's kind<P>

Like father like son chop off the head but the body lives on<BR>
Falling from grace leaves a cool empty space in the sky<P>

Like father like son chop off the head but the body lives on<BR>
Heaven that made you has screwed you and laughed <BR>
Falling from grace leaves a cool empty space in the sky<P>

<A NAME="Meltdown"><H2>Meltdown</H2></A>

Hey you wait... cringing in the dark<BR>
You create what you always fear<BR>
A puppet of hatred dishing out poison<P>

You use me for bait your begging bowl of lies<BR>
Chain letters of snivelling compromise<BR>
I can smell the difference... your truth and your fiction<BR>
You and your twisted convictions<P>

Were you my friend when I belonged ?<BR>
Were you my friend when I was strong ?<BR>
Were you my friend when I was weak ?<BR>
Were you my friend when I was crawling, calling... out of my head ?<P>

Cold... like your blood, the snake is always cool ( cool )<BR>
When things get tough<BR>
You slither on the ground<BR>
You cover up your tracks when I'm around<P>

It's over now my friend<BR>
Your dog has had his day<BR>
It's payback time for what you had to say<BR>
You're stuck with the life you made<BR>
Stuck with the plans you made<BR>
Stuck with everything you are<P>

<A NAME="Octavia"><H2>Octavia</H2></A>

I'm vacuum breathing and open-mouthed as the red shift tills my eyes<BR>
Oh minister my promises as her shadow cuts the day away<BR>
I remembered you, when you walked into that room<P>

Now dislocated, jagged pieces<BR>
Are sliding into this broken mind<BR>
I'm swimming back against the river<BR>
But I'm rising with the tide<P>

Where we came from<BR>
We're all going back there soon<P>

How many times have we met this way<BR>
How many times have we lived before<BR>
How many faces and how many names<BR>
Shadows come but shadows are gone<BR>
Shadows come but shadows are gone<P>

<A NAME="Innerspace"><H2>Innerspace</H2></A>

I see the scars of action writhing round your face<BR>
Too much inactivity and homes a lonely place<BR>
Throw away your beauty cos you know it won't last<BR>
Throw away your present cos you've been living in the past<P>

So take a trip with me, across the bridge of lunacy<BR>
Fire up some beast and ride the skywaves<BR>
Don't wanna waste my time on you if you can't travel this way too<BR>
Fire up this beast and we'll ride the skywaves<P>

I've thrown away my images, they're all so distant now<BR>
Discovery was a stranger then, so welcome to my house<BR>
Whatever demons torture me, I love them like a friend<BR>
Nothing lasts forever but the certainty of change<P>

I'd rather move around and be than figure out life and what it means<BR>
Fire up some beast and ride the skywaves<BR>
And the fireball work is done and we are part of the Nuclear one<BR>
The whole Damn thing begins again<P>

Our glory days have just begun<BR>
A fiery sideslip then we're gone...<BR>
I'll see ya Monday morning...<BR>
Anyway, I'm coming back...<P>

<A NAME="Paradise"><H2>Strange Death In Paradise</H2></A>

Spiralling falling, a silver machine<BR>
From wings of freedom silent above<BR>
Eyelids were burning summer sun roasting<BR>
Tumbling chrome in the dear blue sky<P>

Brighter than sunshine for all of our lifetimes<BR>
1000 stars turned day into night at the end<P>

Where were you when it fell from the sky ?<BR>
I saw the movie, I read the reply<BR>
In the beginning there was only the word<P>

People were kissing in fron tof their shadows<BR>
Children were playing out in the yard<BR>
I am not guilty, I made no difference<BR>
I wasn't born and I wasn't made on that day<P>

Where were you when it fell from the sky ?<BR>
I saw the movie, I read the reply<BR>
In the beginning there was only the word<P>

Strange death in Paradise ( 6 times )<P>
