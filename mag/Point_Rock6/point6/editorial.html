<H2><B>Heads up !!!</B></H2><BR><BR>

Oh no !!! <B>HE</B>'s back... God help us !!!

<P>

A new issue, a new layout ! I have yet again improved my HTML skills and I have changed a little
the presentation of the magazine. I will now use the frames : it will be easier to browse the
pages of Point & Rock.

<P>

So, more than 50 persons have read P&R 5. I hope this number will grow higher as long as new
issues will be edited. I count on you to pass the word ! I need interested readers.<BR>
Another thing I need is votes for the charts. So go there now and <A HREF="charts.html">fill in the
form</A>. It will take you two minutes of your time : I want to know your actual 10 favourite albums.

<P>

It's done ??? OK, we can continue !<BR>
I don't have a lot to say here... Maybe that I'm happy... Happy because it seems the frontier
between Techno and Metal has been broken. Some bands has sucessfully crossed the two genres and we
see now new musics are appearing. Techno bands like Prodigy don't hesitate to use guitars in their songs
and the result is an ultra-violent mix ( especialy live ). Other bands like Fear Factory are remixing
their albums in a techno way. Yet again, the result is quite violent.

<P>

And it's just we want to have isn't it ???

<P>

I see the future with an optimistic look. I guess that many bands will emerge from this Scene with
this kind of music.

<P>

If you share my point of view, you can <A HREF="mailto:nr18@geocities.com">contact me</A> to tell me
what you think about this. Do it also if you hate what is happening. I like to know the opinions of
my readers.

<P>

OK, I let you now. May the following pages satisfy your curiousity !!!
