The previous album of the band was not especially good because it was the exact copy of the powerfull
<I>Deaf Dumb Blind</I>.<BR>
So, what is the situation now ???<P>

Clawfinger is still playing in RAP-METAL style, but the band has quite evoluted since the last
album. Their music is more diversified now : they use again samples everywhere with hard guitars
but they have added an undefined little something more and this is exactly this undefined little
something which does the job.<P>

Clawfinger the album is really interesting. Of course, there are some songs in the direct line
from <I>Nigger</I> and <I>The Truth</I> ( like <I>Biggest & The Best</I> ), but some songs differs
from others ( <I>Hold your Head Up</I>, <I>Chances</I>,... ).

<P>

Well, my quote for this album : I can decide myself between 7 or 8, so I put an decent 7.5 /10
