Here are the latest news found on the official site :<P>

Iron Maiden have been back in Steve Harris' Barnyard Studios working on a new studio album for
the last few months.<BR>
Says Harris "<I>Recording is going really well. Were half-way through Blazes' vocals and
should start mixing soon.</I>"<P>

The album is scheduled for release early next year and will be followed by a massive World
Tour. Rumour has it that Maiden will return to the massive shows of the 80's with huge production,
Lighting and enough pyro to blow away a fair size stadium. Their legendary maniac of lights
and production, the aptly named Dave Lights, has returned to the fold after a self imposed
exile of almost 10 years. Dave was responsible for the legendary and massive shows for
the Powerslave, Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son Tours. The Band are taking special insurance
against Dave blinding or deafening fans and against themselves being blown up - which has
happened in the past with various degrees of severity.<P>

The tour will take in arenas and stadiums Worldwide starting in the spring.<P>

Also in the spring, Maiden expect to release their eagerly anticipated computer game. The original
game "Melt" was scrapped as, according to Blaze "<I>It was crap. Maiden want to give their fans
something to blow them away. The new one will.</I>"<P>

The new game has been developed since early this year by Synthetic Dimensions, who have been
responsible for a number of recent successes, such as "Corporation", "Legends of Valor" and
"Perfect Assassin".<P>

Says Blaze "<I>This game is nearly there. You've got to get to Eddie through time and space,
heaven and hell..... the works ! It's a shoot 'em up which we promise will out-shoot`em all</I>".<P>

Look out for some great new merchandise real soon and will be available through our new
cyberstore, stay tuned for our grand opening.<P>

The fan club takes on a new dimension soon for all you internet freaks, with all sorts of benefits
and discounts on merchandise.<P>

We've read somewhere that Moby, who was supposed to produce the next album of Guns n' Roses ( or
should we say the next album of Axl Rose ? ) has finally decided to refuse the job. Moby says <I>" The
band has tons of material but they must choose what to use. Some things I've heard are good."</I><BR>
In another side, if you understand something in the situation of the band, could you mail to the
redaction to explain it ??? I would be gratefull ;-)<BR>
