I know this album has been released months ago, but I have discovered Rammstein recently at the
<A HREF="pukkelpop.html" TARGET="FRAME2">Pukkelpop 97</A>. I know their second album is out, but I
have not yet bought it. Then STOP to criticize me and put an ear on this wonderful piece of plastic.

<P>

This album is a fist in your face. The power of the music combined with the ultra-deep voice of
the singer ( who sings in german if you don't know it already ) produces a really aggressive sound.
They also use samples here and there, and this adds a cyber touch to the ensemble.<BR>
The entire album is very powerfull and even the single "slower" song ( Seemann ) is strong in emotions
and is violent sometimes.

<P>

I can't tell anymore than <B>HEAR THIS CD NOW !!!</B>. If you don't, you are missing something.<BR>
It's simple : here, this album is running in loop...

<P>

My quote : an enormous 10/10 !!! It's a total success.
