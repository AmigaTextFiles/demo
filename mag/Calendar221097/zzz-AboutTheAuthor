I'm from Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
Actually Catalonia is a part of Spain, but lots of catalans hope
to be independent soon! :-)

I spend all my time travelling from Party to Party, and that's the
rason for collecting Party-invitations & infos.

As I only spend money in gasoline (in fact, gasoil), it's not
expensive to travell like that.

Sleeping in the car, all the food is buyed in my home city at very
(very) low prices... :-)
My computer is an "obsolete" A500, customized, because as I say I
only spend money in trips.

The only 'job' I have is as a kind of "commercial agent", buying
cheap computer tools and then re-selling a little more expensive
(but still very cheap!).

And finally, believe it or not, I also survive thanks of the
donations.  =-)

Thanks to all friends arround the world!  :-D
