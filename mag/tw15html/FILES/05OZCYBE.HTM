          A Lateral Leading Edge: Australian SF and Cyberpunk

                 Tomorrow has arrived, and it is not a
                             pretty sight.
                     David Manasian, The Economist

Cyberpunk  by itself is difficult enough to write about.  Not only is it
ill-defined,  but  often  it  means  contradictory  things  to different
people.   Writing  about cyberpunk in Australia is harder still, because
there has been so little of it.  Thus we are going to have to define the
term itself, both inside and outside science fiction, as well as explain
just  why it had such a poor following among Australian SF authors.  Let
us start with the technical side.

Sean - Cyber:
We  will  start with .  .  .  not so much a definition as an exploration
of  cyberpunk  culture.   Cyberpunk  is not just a literary movement; it
covers  a  much larger phenomenon and it did not arise overnight.  Early
in  this  century  amateur  radio  enthusiasts pioneered the practice of
exploring the world without leaving the comfort of one's home.  The most
primitive  form  of  computer  hacking  began in the '60s, when students
began  experimenting  with  ways  to  crack security on early multi-user
operating systems.  Then, in the early '70s, the phone phreaks appeared,
dedicated to the practice of cracking telephone network security for fun
and adventure.

Science  fiction  took its time adjusting to computers.  For a time they
were   room-sized   electronic   brains   that   would  suddenly  become
super-intelligent and try to take over the world until some square-jawed
hero  got to the Central Processing Unit with an axe.  In the early '70s
the  stories  began  to  reflect more subtle aspects of computer design.
After  hearing  a  scientist  describe  a  self-replicating  program  as
behaving  like  a virus, David Gerrold wrote When Harlie Was One (1972),
featuring  that  scourge  of modern Information Technology, the computer
virus.   The  computer  worm  slithered into being in John Brunner's The
Shockwave  Rider  (1975),  nearly  fifteen years before the night of the
dreaded  Internet  Worm,  when  America's  primary academic and military
research network was brought to a standstill.

All  through  the '70s university students had been hacking out of their
restricted  mainframe  accounts and into more exciting areas of academic
computers,  yet  the  really  fundamental breakthrough was the advent of
cheap  telephone  modems.   A  hacker  could  now  sit  at  home  with a
telephone,  modem  and  terminal, screen phone numbers for the tell-tale
warble  of  a  computer  connection,  then  attempt  to hack through the
machine's  security  measures.   Whether  for fun or (illegal) profit, a
hacker  culture  began  to  evolve.   William Gibson's "Johnny Mnemonic"
(Omni,  1981)  was  published  just when the hacking craze was gathering
pace  and  a  year  before  the  notorious Inner Circle hacker group was
formed.   By  the  time Gibson's Neuromancer came out in 1984, the Inner
Circle  had  reached  the  public  eye as a result of FBI raids, and the
movie  War  Games had popularised hacking amongst a large section of the
adolescent  population.   Hacking was real, hacking was fun, hacking was
in.   Punk  was  also  fashionable around then.  Napoleon might not have
caused the French Revolution, but he made good use of its circumstances.
In the same way, Gibson hit the scene just as the frontier opened up.

Terry - Literary:
Just  as  Star  Wars  brought  SF to a larger popular consciousness, and
Jurassic  Park  gave  us  dinosaurs  again,  so  cyberpunk shows us that
sometimes the tail wags the dog so well it's taken for the whole animal.
Dynamic but hardly original works like Star Wars and Star Trek have come
to  represent  the sci-fi phenomenon for many, leaving a major imbalance
in  how  science  fiction is viewed in relation to mainstream literature
and  popular  culture.   Thus  there is a reverse tendency:  to identify
trends,  even  movements, which don't amount to all that much when taken
with   larger   literary   standards.   The  contrast  makes  them  seem
self-important, even parochial and contrived.

The  New  Wave,  for instance, was an appropriate and exciting watershed
for  the genre, reflecting the same questioning of forms that marked the
'60s  generally,  yet  it  was  hardly  fresh  when  ranged  against the
explorations  of  form achieved by the likes of Woolf, Joyce and Beckett
earlier in the century, or by Laurence Sterne as early as the Eighteenth
Century.  Contemporary social relevance rather than originality provided
its   dynamic,   and   the   question  remains:   was  it  reflecting  a
consciousness that was new or did it merely represent catching up?

So  too  cyberpunk,  as  a subgenre and taken in the larger view, may be
seen  as  little  more  than  a carefully reified storm in a chipped and
retro-fitted teacup, coming as it did on the heels of Blade Runner, film
noir  and  Sam  Spade - those things given a timely, high-tech spin, but
self-caricaturing  and  limited,  and difficult to regard as a movement.
Neuromancer  (increasingly  anomalous  with  every novel that Gibson has
published)  has  more affinities with Bester's The Demolished Man (1953)
and  Tiger,  Tiger (1956) in form and flavour than any narrow definition
of  a  cyberpunk  'movement'.  The works which have come to characterise
the sub-genre actually changed perceptions.  Most cyberpunk tales don't.
They   simply   imitate,  and  are  actually  quite  limited,  ordinary,
jumped-on-the-bandwagon-but-missed-the-train stuff.

Sean - Cyber:
Cyberpunk  and  hacking  are  quite  closely  associated  in the popular
consciousness.   One  problem  with  SF  and  hacking is the mysterious,
seemingly  miraculous  methods  required to crack computer security.  In
practice  most  intrusions are the result of lateral thinking.  Remember
the  1983  film  War  Games?  The schoolboy hacker hero got unauthorised
access to the school computer by sneaking a look at the password, not by
magic.   Back  in  the  real  world  a  hacker  was  driven  into such a
vindictive  frenzy  by  a  Cray  supercomputer's  tight security that he
hacked  the  Unix  workstation  controlling  the Cray's cooling system -
causing  it  to crash and bringing the supercomputer down as well.  Once
again,  lateral  thinking,  not  magic.   Greg  Egan  describes  a quite
plausible  hacking  job  in  his  story  "Blood Sisters" (Interzone, Feb
1991),  and it gives the story considerable strength.  Note however that
neither War Games nor "Blood Sisters" could be described as cyberpunk.

So  much  for  hacking, but what about the hackers themselves?  They are
about  as diverse a group as one could imagine, except that they tend to
be  male.   Real-world hackers have a class structure and pecking order,
and  this  is  reflected  in  SF.  To use Gibsonian paradigms again, the
character  Case  in  Neuromancer  was  one  of  the elite, whereas Bobby
Newmark  in  Count Zero (1986) was a mere wannabee.  Most hackers are in
Bobby's  category,  and by their very incompetence they amount to little
more  than  nuisance  value.  Some specialise in writing virus programs,
and  some  prefer  worms,  but  most  seem  to go in for the traditional
intrusion  method.   Many are company insiders with a position of trust,
some do it for money, and some just want the adventure.

What  do  I  personally  think of hacking?  It doesn't appeal, I have to
confess.  If I'm working on a system and I see a hole in the security my
inclination  is  to  leave a README file for the administrator along the
lines  of "I managed this unauthorised intrusion by doing such-and-such.
I would strongly advise you to plug this hole in the system."

So that is the cyber part of it.  Punk probably needs no explanation, so
what  happens  when  we put the terms together?  As far as the public is
concerned,  the  result looks horrible.  Punk conjures up the image of a
large, malevolent psychopath with weirdly cut and coloured hair, dressed
in  clothes  that  look  and  smell like they have been dredged out of a
sewer  -  and is liable to beat the daylights out of you if you stare at
him for too long, and who is likely to give you AIDS if you hit back and
cut  your  fist  on  his  teeth.  Cyber tends to be associated with some
nondescript,  daggy  kid  who  bats  away  at  his  PC for 72 hours at a
stretch,  eating  cold  turkey  stuffing  out  of a packet and relieving
himself  in a coke bottle while he mysteriously charges a telephone call
to  Los  Angeles  to  your  account  so he can do unauthorised things to
nuclear  missile  launch  computers - and who is liable to trash your PC
with  the  latest  computer virus and transfer the contents of your bank
account to the Roger Rabbit Appreciation Society if you dare complain.

Terry - Punk:
Analyse  what  is  behind the popular misconceptions and we find that we
are dealing with nothing more than convenient icons.  To use an analogy,
there  was  only  one  mass  bra-burning  incident  in the early Women's
Movement,  yet that image became an icon in popular consciousness.  Most
punks  are making more of a cultural, artistic or fashion statement, and
most  cybernerds  are  more  interested  in games and mucking about with
email than cybernetic mayhem.  Put CYBER and PUNK together, however .  .
.

Sean - Cyber:
.   .   .   and  a  slavering, unstoppable, computer-raping offspring is
taken for granted by the general population.

Real-world  cyberpunk  covers  a large and ill-defined area - an area so
large  that  it  is actually meaningless.  There is the Sydney cyberpunk
band,  Bass Age, for example, which consists of three humans and several
computer-based  instruments.   In  full  costume the sight of Bass Age's
humans is enough to make respectable citizens cross to the other side of
the  street, yet they are polite, friendly and well-spoken on a personal
level:  cyberpunk is only the image.  The science magazine Helix has run
two  articles  on  hackers,  "Attack  Of  The Cyberpunks" (Aug/Sept) and
"Hacking The Cyberpunks" (Oct/Nov), yet the only suggestion of "punk" in
the articles is the suggestion of anti-authoritarianism as a motive.  In
SF  cyberpunk becomes even more of a problem.  It often means speaking a
convincing  street-language  of high tech while telling stories that are
apolitical yet anti-authoritarian.

Real-world hackers do seem to read SF cyberpunk, and often they even try
to write it.  Judge any SF short story competition, which I do from time
to  time, and you are sure to encounter several examples where the theme
revolves  around  some  cocky young kid who hacks about on "the Network"
until  he  (remember, they're nearly always male) comes to the attention
of  some  secret  organisation  that either recruits him or has his head
blown  off.   In the USA in the mid-'80s it got so bad that some editors
introduced  the ABC (Anything But Cyberpunk) policy.  Cyberpunk in SF is
probably so popular with real-world "cyberpunks" because it is the stuff
of  their dreams.  The real-world hacker, like the real-world scientist,
spends  a huge amount of time on boring legwork, with only an occasional
exciting  breakthrough.   The  SF story puts all the excitement into one
package, and a totally safe one at that.

Terry - Literary:
If  we are going to discuss cyberpunk fiction by Australians, we need to
identify  it.   Like  good  art, people tend not to be able to define it
particularly  well,  but  they  think  they  know  it  when they see it.
Nonetheless,  even  this intuitive approach has its problems.  How is it
that  people  can consider Bruce Sterling's Islands In The Net (1988) to
be  cyberpunk,  but  not  Greg  Bear's Queen Of Angels (1990)?  Gibson's
Neuromancer  is  generally  taken  to be the archetype, featuring a fast
moving,  language  driven,  technically  orientated tale from the future
underculture, so it will have to do as our yardstick.

Although  Neuromancer  won  the  Hugo  at  the  World  SF  Convention in
Melbourne  in  1985,  Australians  were  slow  to follow in its wake and
cyberpunk  took  its  time  getting established with Australian authors.
Interestingly, Melbourne was also the city of origin of the Tessier side
of  the  Tessier-Ashpool  family in William Gibson's first three novels,
and  in  general  Australia  and  Australians often feature in cyberpunk
works from overseas.

Sean - Cyber:
Australia's publishing industry of the 1980s was partly to blame.  There
was  a  large  market  for short fiction, yet it had to be short fiction
with  a  strong  academic/literary  orientation.   The  market  favoured
stories  of  around  3000 words with a leaning towards themes and issues
that would be considered 'significant' or at least 'worthy'.  Clearly SF
in  general,  and  cyberpunk  in  particular, had a hard time in such an
environment.   In  spite of all the difficulties, however, opportunities
did  arise  which  seemed  to  favour cyberpunk being published locally.
Between  November 1987 and November 1988 eighteen stories were published
in  the  local computer press - namely The Australian newspaper's weekly
computer supplement and the weekly magazine Computing Australia.

Terry - Literary:
Of  all  places to find cyberpunk, one might have expected that it would
be  most  likely to surface in fiction appearing in computing magazines,
but  only one story even came close to resembling cyberpunk.  The twelve
Computing  Australia  stories  were  finalists  in  a $5,000 short story
competition,  and the author of the winning story was serving a sentence
in  a  Victorian  jail  for  theft.   Surely one could not hope for more
conducive  conditions for cyberpunk to appear, yet the themes and styles
that  he  used  were  very conventional.  The single story that might be
identified  as  cyberpunk was a finalist in the competition, but not the
winner  -  and  the  author  has definitely not been in jail.  Comparing
"Just  A  Company  Man"  (7/12/87), by Perry Morrison with, say, William
Gibson's  early  short  works,  is  rather  like  comparing  the  Wright
Brothers'  Flyer  with the Concorde:  they both fly, but the latter does
it  a  lot  better.  Morrison attempts to make use of pace, language and
technology  to  get  the reader involved, but basically he has written a
pacy,  simple  crime  story.   Some fairly archaic forms are employed in
order  to  construct  streetwise  language:  "Sorry mister, he said, but
ain't  nobody  allowed  ta have blasters in the Lizard.  So gimmie it or
else  I  gotta  bust  ya."  Not quite Ratz in the Chatsubo.  Morrison, a
computer  professional,  tries  hard  to  evoke  real  life,  futuristic
high-technology  by the use of slang yet the result comes out either too
stilted or too polite to be convincing.

Of  the  six stories in The Australian, five were comic pieces, and were
very  conventional  in  style,  structure  and  language.   The last was
Fredlein's   "A  Biassed  Symbiosis"  (21/6/93),  in  which  a  covertly
totalitarian  government  recruits a young hacker to help rig elections.
As  a  story  it seems to borrow more from Orwell than cyberpunk, and is
basically a conventional work of SF.

Many of the eighteen stories were well written, many were good SF, and a
few  even  managed  to  be  both, but stylistically they could have been
written  in  the  1950s.   Gibson's  concept of a futuristic skid row is
beyond  the  interest  of  these  authors, whose characters are, without
exception, middle class and bland.

Sean  -  Literary (.  .  .  just to prove that there's more to me than a
fast CPU and a couple of hundred Gig.  of storage):  At this point it is
necessary  to  say  a  few  words on language.  Its role in cyberpunk is
crucial,  yet  it  is  an aspect of creating futuristic ambience that is
most  often  neglected  or  misinterpreted  in Australia.  Within years,
sometimes   months,   most   new  and  trendy  terms  will  have  become
"establishment",  if  not  actually  obsolete.   Remember  that it takes
around  fourteen  months  for  a  story to reach the newsstands from the
actual  date  of  submission.  Clearly then, one needs the freshness and
excitement  of  a  new  term  without  being  dependant  on a real-world
vocabulary  that  can  become  obsolete  while the story is still at the
printers.  Authority can compensate for this unstable foundation, and an
examination of the better overseas cyberpunk supports this.

Gibson's  use  of  a  type  of latter-day Japanesquery is one example of
terminological authority.  Japan's current domination of a large section
of  the  world's  economy  and overall technological excellence are long
term,  so that companies, brands and products whose names are structured
to  produce  associations  with contemporary names are able to carry the
illusion  of  being  state-of-the-art.  The Ono-Sendai decks in Gibson's
novels  are  sufficiently  attuned to the contemporary computer industry
language to sound 'real', yet the name is sufficiently removed not to be
affected by the speed at which the industry is evolving.  It is much the
same  with  the  pop  component  of cyberpunk language, in that one must
convey a sense of the latest fashions in terms that do not age.

Going back to the early 1980s, there are a few examples of Australian SF
with more strongly defined cyberpunk characteristics.  In May 1982 Terry
Dowling  had "The Man Who Walks Away Behind The Eyes" published in Omega
Science  Digest.   The  story is surrealist in structure and content:  a
man  is  to  be  executed  within his own mind, but when his executioner
comes  stalking  him  he  flees,  hides  and fights back within himself.
While  the  story  incorporates  most of the stylistic features that one
would expect to find in cyberpunk (including virtual reality), the style
is  cerebral rather than streetwise.  The story was Dowling's first, and
it won the Ditmar Award the following year.

In  mid-1985  Russell Blackford's "Glass Reptile Breakout" was published
in the anthology Strange Attractors.  Blackford's setting is much closer
to  cyberpunk than in any of the other stories.  Blackford is an admirer
of  overseas cyberpunk authors, and both the language and setting of the
story are identifiably cyberpunk.  Set some decades into the future, the
story features fashions in punk body modifications, and discos that have
such entertainment features as self-mutilators.  Well, some contemporary
Tokyo  clubs  feature  live  enema  shows,  so  why  not?  The language,
setting,  and  technology  are  all  convincing,  and  it  is definitely
cyberpunk.   It is interesting to note that Blackford has a Doctorate in
English.

Thus  two  authors  well  grounded in the study of language, but without
strong  backgrounds  in  computing,  were  closer to getting cyberpunk's
language  right than those writing for the computer press - as one might
expect.   Cyberpunk's most important characteristic is its language, and
while  it  is  vital, even crucial, to get the technology right, without
language there is no cyberpunk.

Other  Australian  authors have also made use of the computer culture in
their  SF  writing.  Gillian Rubenstein is one of Australia's best known
children's  authors.  Two of her novels, Space Demons (1986) and Skymaze
(1989)  incorporate  the  familiar  cyberpunk  of computer games but the
style  and  prose  are  quite conventional.  Space Demons is a prototype
computer  game  imported  directly  from  Japan,  and  has the effect of
forcing  the  players to confront the darker sides of their own natures.
Hate initiates the game, quite literally, and the players participate by
generating  aggression.   Unknown to the players, one wins by conquering
hate,  and  putting  one's gun down.  Space Demons has had several print
runs,  and has won a number of awards - all of them non-genre.  Note yet
again  that  Rubenstein  has  an academic background in language, having
studied  Modern  Languages at Oxford before coming to Australia.  She is
only  one  of  several  authors  who have evoked the pace and excitement
characteristic  of  cyberpunk  without  making a commitment to the style
itself.

There   is   evidence   that  other  Australian  SF  writers  have  been
experimenting with the cyberpunk form, but have not been lucky enough to
see  their  work  reach  print.  In 1990 the local representative of the
Writers  of  the  Future competition estimated that one story in fifteen
submitted  in  Australia  was  cyberpunk  in  both  style  and  content.
Remember  that  one  story in eighteen amongst the computer press SF was
cyberpunk,  and  we  can  conclude that there was a small groundswell of
cyberpunk  writing in Australia by 1989.  Where did it go from there?  I
was  recently  a  judge for a short story competition where one entry in
six  was  cyberpunk,  and  other  works  have  made it into print.  Some
authors certainly have embraced cyberpunk as it is generally understood.
For  example Paul Collins, a prolific and stylish Australian author, has
made use of the form consistently in his short stories, particularly the
Calloway series.  Damien Broderick is another fine Australian SF author,
some  of whose works seem to come close to the sub-genre:  "Coming Back"
(Fantasy  &amp; Science Fiction, Dec 1982) and The Judas Mandala (1982), for
example.  In cases like these, one has to apply the "I'll know it when I
see  it" principle.  Broderick writes SF, and - unlike many authors - he
very sensibly keeps up with current trends.  This might give his works a
particular  flavour  from  time to time, but it does not force them into
any specific basket.

Terry - Literary:
Remember  that  the  best cyberpunk work (like the best surrealist work,
for  example)  has probably been produced independently of any movement,
often  produced  obliquely  to  it  and in spite of it.  In other words,
original, synthesising, ground-breaking work often proceeds tangentially
and is at odds with the followers, imitators, joiners and marketeers who
seek  to honour, emulate and enshrine it as a real social force.  Gibson
himself  was  pre-cyberpunk!  His own original lack of computer literacy
is  the  ultimate  irony in this regard -showing that it is a perceptual
shift,  a  streetwise  hipness  of  viewing  trends  to  which  computer
knowledge  is  incidental, merely part of the enabling decor.  Like most
movements,  cyberpunk  is  a  reactive  thing  -  a social perception, a
different  way  of  seeing and ordering reality.  Computer knowledge and
language  are its hallmarks, not its driving force:  that is why being a
computer  wizard  or  hacker,  or even a gifted linguist are not enough.
You  have to have the intuitive consciousness, the correct second-nature
intention, something quite hard to identify among all the imitators.

So what is going on in Australia today?  Is Australian cyberpunk booming
and  winning  awards, or is it just a minor style that never really took
off?   Let's  check  overseas for a benchmark.  Bruce Sterling is widely
known  as a Mister Cyberpunk by reputation, so how does his current work
look?   Islands  In  The  Net  is  said  to  be cyberpunk because of the
author's  reputation,  but  it is really something more than that.  Some
dinosaurs  might have evolved into birds, but it is stretching the point
a  bit  to  refer  to  birds  as  dinosaurs.   They  have  built on some
characteristics  of  their  ancestors,  but  they  have become something
different.   The  same  applies  to  such  problematic works as Queen Of
Angels and Islands In The Net in their relation to cyberpunk.

Cyberpunk  has  given  way to .  .  .  let's call it realtech, a type of
rigorous,  hard SF.  Realtech is not dehumanised technophilia, it is the
provision  of the firmest possible technical basis for the characters to
play  their  roles  upon.   Statements on the human condition require an
accurate  depiction  of  the  human environment, and there are plenty of
mainstream   literary  works  with  little  basis  in  fact.   Make  the
environment fanciful and the statement is weakened as well.

In  Australia  Greg  Egan  and  Sean  McMullen  are clearly two realtech
naturals.   While  Egan's SF is about as high tech as one can get, it is
marginal  as  cyberpunk.   The  story  that  many  consider to be Egan's
finest,   "The   Caress"  (Asimov's  SF  Magazine,  Jan  1990)  featured
bio-engineering, computer technology and high-tech criminals, and had it
been  published in the mid-'80s it might have been called cyberpunk.  In
the  1990s  it  is  something  else.   His  Ditmar  Award  winning novel
Quarantine  (1992) makes extensive use of cyberpunk backdrops and icons,
but  it  reads  as  very sophisticated science fiction.  Sean McMullen's
near-future story "Alone In His Chariot" (Eidolon, Mar 1991) was another
Ditmar  Award  winner,  but  while  it  dealt  with the underground drug
culture,  high  tech medical research and a type of virtual reality, the
author  admits  to writing it without consciously thinking of cyberpunk.
Its language is definitely not that of the sub-genre.

Sean &amp; Terry - Cyberpunk In Australia:
When  Cyberpunk  in  its  'classic'  form  arrived  on  the scene in the
mid-'80s, it was a bad time to get established in Australia.  Many local
authors  were  still experimenting with New Wave styles better suited to
the late '60s, those authors willing to try their hand at cyberpunk were
often  inexperienced newcomers who had a hard time selling their work at
all,  and  the  local  SF  publishing  industry  was  about to go into a
temporary   decline.    During   Neuromancer's  first  decade  of  life,
Australian  authors  did not manage to jack in to the overseas cyberpunk
market  before  it  waned,  yet  it was not for want of trying.  Perhaps
cyberpunk's  legacy  in  Australia  is  that  by  the  early  '90s  some
Australian  SF  authors  had  noted its strengths and built on them very
successfully to create a different type of leading edge.
