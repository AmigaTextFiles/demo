A Note From the director of

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Bolt-Co Merchandise Ltd</CENTER></FONT></B>



Bolt-Co  Ltd  would  like  to  warn its loyal customers about two lesser
copycat  firms  which  have recently sprung up and are trading under the
names "TF-Ripoffs" and "D!crosoft"

These companies offer products of a much lower standard, and do not care
about  you, the customer, after they have got your cash.  Bolt-Co offers
full, comprehensive, aftersales support.

Bolt-Co has been trading since 1994 when we introduced our first product
"Stick  On  Furry Fod (TM)" which was designed to combat the embarasment
caused by slap heads by covering the slap with realistic glue on hair.

Our  product  range expanded to include comic strips, ear wax cleansers,
guitars,  porno  teddy  bears, keyboard layout diagrams, right up to our
latest lines in microwaved gold cds.

For more information on Bolt-Co products, mail me at abolt5@hotmail.com,
or visit our web page at www.boltco.com
