Hacker Vows 'Terror' for Child Pornographers
By Steve Silberman


2:32pm 13.Jun.97.PDT After 17 years in the hacker underground, Christian
Valor - well known among old-school hackers and phone phreaks as "Se7en"
-  was  convinced  that  most  of  what gets written in the papers about
computers  and hacking is sensationalistic jive.  For years, Valor says,
he  sneered  at reports of the incidence of child pornography on the Net
as "exaggerated/over-hyped/fearmongered/bullshit."

Now  making  his living as a lecturer on computer security, Se7en claims
he  combed  the  Net  for  child  pornography  for eight weeks last year
without finding a single image.

That  changed  a  couple of weeks ago, he says, when a JPEG mailed by an
anonymous  prankster  sent him on an odyssey through a different kind of
underground:   IRC  chat  rooms  with  names  like  #littlegirlsex,  ftp
directories  crammed  with filenames like 6yoanal.jpg and 8&amp;dad.jpg, and
newsgroups  like  alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen.  The anonymous
file, he says, contained a "very graphic" image of a girl "no older than
4 years old."

On  8  June, Se7en vowed on a hacker's mailing list to deliver a dose of
"genuine  hacker  terror" to those who upload and distribute such images
on  the Net.  The debate over his methods has stirred up tough questions
among  his  peers about civil liberties, property rights, and the ethics
of vigilante justice.

A Declaration of War

What  Se7en  tapped  into,  he  says,  was  a "very paranoid" network of
traders of preteen erotica.  In his declaration of "public war" - posted
to a mailing list devoted to an annual hacker's convention called DefCon
-  Se7en  explains  that  the  protocol on most child-porn servers is to
upload  selections from your own stash, in exchange for credits for more
images.

What  he  saw  on those servers made him physically sick, he says.  "For
someone  who  took  a virtual tour of the kiddie-porn world for only one
day,"  he  writes,  "I  had  the  opportunity to fully max out an Iomega
100-MB Zip disc."

Se7en's   plan  to  "eradicate"  child-porn  traders  from  the  Net  is
"advocating malicious, destructive hacking against these people." He has
enlisted  the  expertise  of  two  fellow  hackers for the first wave of
attacks, which are under way.

Se7en  feels  confident  that  legal authorities will look the other way
when the victims of hacks are child pornographers - and he claims that a
Secret  Service agent told him so explicitly.  Referring to a command to
wipe  out  a  hard  drive by remote access, Se7en boasted, "Who are they
going to run to?  The police?  'They hacked my kiddie-porn server and rm
-rf'd my computer!' Right."

Se7en claims to have already "taken down" a "major player" - an employee
of  Southwestern  Bell  who  Se7en  says  was  "posting ads all over the
place."  Se7en  told  Wired  News  that  he  covertly  watched the man's
activities for days, gathering evidence that he emailed to the president
of  Southwestern  Bell.   Pseudonymous  remailers  like  hotmail.com and
juno.com, Se7en insists, provide no security blanket for traders against
hackers uncovering their true identities by cracking server logs.  Se7en
admits  the  process  of  gaining  access to the logs is time consuming,
however.  Even with three hackers on the case, it "can take two or three
days.  We don't want to hit the wrong person."

A  couple  of  days  after  submitting  message  headers and logs to the
president  and  network administrators of Southwestern Bell, Se7en says,
he got a letter saying the employee was "no longer on the payroll."

The Hacker Search For Acceptance

Se7en's  declaration  of  war  received  support on the original mailing
list.   "I  am  all for freedom of speech/expression," wrote one poster,
"but  there  are  some  things that are just wrong....  I feel a certain
moral  obligation  to  the  human  race to do my part in cleaning up the
evil."

Federal  crackdowns  targeting child pornographers are ineffective, many
argued.  In April, FBI director Louis Freeh testified to the Senate that
the  bureau operation dubbed "Innocent Images" had gathered the names of
nearly  4,000 suspected child-porn traffickers into its database.  Freeh
admitted,  however, that only 83 of those cases resulted in convictions.
(The Washington Times reports that there have also been two suicides.)

The director's plan?  Ask for more federal money to fight the "dark side
of the Internet" - US$10 million.

Pitching in to assist the Feds just isn't the hacker way.  As one poster
to  the  DefCon  list  put it, "The government can't enforce laws on the
Internet.   We  all know that.  We can enforce laws on the Internet.  We
all know that too."

The DefCon list was not a unanimous chorus of praise for Se7en's plan to
give  the  pornographers  a  taste  of hacker terror, however.  The most
vocal  dissenter has been Declan McCullagh, Washington correspondent for
the  Netly  News.   McCullagh is an outspoken champion of constitutional
rights,  and  a  former  hacker  himself.   He  says he was disturbed by
hackers  on  the  list affirming the validity of laws against child porn
that he condemns as blatantly unconstitutional.

"Few  people  seem  to realize that the long-standing federal child-porn
law  outlawed  pictures  of  dancing  girls wearing leotards," McCullagh
wrote  -  alluding to the conviction of Stephen Knox, a graduate student
sentenced  to five years in prison for possession of three videotapes of
young  girls  in  bathing  suits.   The  camera, the US attorney general
pointed  out,  lingered  on  the  girls'  genitals, though they remained
clothed.   "The  sexual implications of certain modes of dress, posture,
or  movement  may readily put the genitals on exhibition in a lascivious
manner, without revealing them in a nude display," the Feds argued - and
won.

It's  decisions  like  Knox  v.   US, and a law criminalizing completely
synthetic digital images "presented as" child porn, McCullagh says, that
are  making  the  definition of child pornography unacceptably broad:  a
"thought crime."

The   menace   of  child  porn  is  being  exploited  by  "censor-happy"
legislators  to  "rein  in this unruly cyberspace," McCullagh says.  The
rush to revile child porn on the DefCon list, McCullagh told Wired News,
reminded him of the "loyalty oaths" of the McCarthy era.

"These  are  hackers  in  need of social acceptance," he says.  "They've
been marginalized for so long, they want to be embraced for stamping out
a  social  evil." McCullagh knows his position is a difficult one to put
across  to  an audience of hackers.  In arguing that hackers respect the
property  rights  of  pornographers, and ponder the constitutionality of
the  laws  they're  affirming,  McCullagh  says, "I'm trying to convince
hackers to respect the rule of law, when hacking systems is the opposite
of that."

But  McCullagh  is  not  alone.   As the debate over Se7en's declaration
spread  to the cypherpunks mailing list and alt.cypherpunks - frequented
by  an  older  crowd  than  the  DefCon  list - others expressed similar
reservations over Se7en's plan.

"Basically,  we're  talking  about  a Dirty Harry attitude," one network
technician/cypherpunk  told Wired News.  Though he senses "real feeling"
behind  Se7en's  battle  cry,  he  feels  that the best way to deal with
pornographers is to "turn the police loose on them." Another participant
in  the  discussion says that while he condemns child porn as "terrible,
intrinsically a crime against innocence," he questions the effectiveness
of Se7en's strategy.

"Killing their computer isn't going to do anything," he says, cautioning
that  the vigilante approach could be taken up by others.  "What happens
if  you  have somebody who doesn't like abortion?  At what point are you
supposed to be enforcing your personal beliefs?"

Raising The Paranoia Level

Se7en's     loathing     for     aficionados    of    newsgroups    like
alt.sex.pedophilia.swaps runs deeper than "belief." "I myself was abused
when  I  was a kid," Se7en told Wired News.  "Luckily, I wasn't a victim
of child pornography, but I know what these kids are going through."

With  just  a  few  hackers  working independently to crack server logs,
sniff  IP  addresses,  and sound the alarm to network administrators, he
says,  "We  can  take  out  one  or  two  people a week ...  and get the
paranoia  level  up,"  so  that "casual traders" will be frightened away
from IRC rooms like "#100%preteensexfuckpics."

It's  not  JPEGs  of  clothed ballerinas that raise his ire, Se7en says.
It's  "the  4-year-olds  being raped, the 6-year-old forced to have oral
sex  with  cum  running down themselves." Such images, Se7en admits, are
very rare - even in online spaces dedicated to trading sexual imagery of
children.

"I  know  what I'm doing is wrong.  I'm trampling on the rights of these
guys,"  he  says.  "But somewhere in the chain, someone is putting these
images  on  paper  before they get uploaded.  Your freedom ends when you
start hurting other people."

'Amateur Action' update

A  full background on the Amateur Action BBS case, including its history
and  the  text  of  relevant  legal  documents,  can be found in the CuD
archives at:  http://www.soci.niu.edu/~aabbs/aabbs.html

Source - fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu

Background:   Robert  and  Carleen Thomas ran an adult-oriented bulletin
board  system from their home in California.  Prosecutors in Tennesee in
1994  downloaded  allegedly  obscene pictures of sexual acts and charged
them.   Of  course, they were applying *their* "community standards" for
obscenity  to  his  California  business.   They  were  found guilty and
sentenced to 37 months.  While that case was on trial, Federal officials
in  Utah  heard  about  and looked into it.  They downloaded pictures of
"nude   and   semi-nude  children"  and  charged  Thomas  in  Utah  with
distributing child pornography, although there is no evidence any Utahan
except  the  official  had  ever done so.  Thomas pled guilty to 1 of 16
charges and appealed alleging double jeopardy.

The  10th  Circuit  Court of Appeals has upheld the decision of the Utah
District  Court.   No  double jeopardy because the individual photos are
different  from  those  which  were tried in the other cases.  Thomas is
serving  a  26-month sentence on this count, concurrently with the other
sentence.  The opinion does not appear to be on the Emory University web
site which tracks these things.

Moral:   anyone  who  distributes  content  nationally  continues  to be
subject  to  prosecution  in  each  and  every  locale  under prevailing
community  standards.   If  your  content  is  objectionable to the most
small-minded  folk  anywhere in the US, it would be wise to refrain from
publishing  it on the internet or other comparable medium.  Prosecutions
continue  to apply local "contemporary community standards" to obscenity
prosecutions,  but  in  meeting  the  Miller test, they are permitted to
demonstrate  that  the material has prurient appeal to someone else.  In
other words, offensive to you, sexually appealing to anyone anywhere.

For  example,  if  space  aliens  landed  tomorrow and their pornography
consisted  of  pictures  that  looked  like cat vomit, prosecutors could
present  evidence  that  the  material  is prurient with regard to space
aliens,  patently offensive to you (cat vomit, you know), and lacking in
serious  literary  value  to  you  (obviously)  and  you would therefore
conclude that the material was obscene.


     [v]enue for federal obscenity prosecutions lies "in any district
     from, through, or into which" the allegedly obscene material
     moves, according to 18 U.S.C. section 3237. This may result in
     prosecutions of persons in a community to which they have sent
     materials which is obscene under that community's standards
     though the community from which it is sent would tolerate the
     same material.

     United States v. Peraino, 645 F.2d 548, 551 (6th Cir. 1981)


So  even  if you refrain from sending material to Tennesee residents, an
internet  router  can make that decision for you by sending data packets
through the state.  What a great piece of law.

Call for open world-wide conveniton on the Net

A different kind of war:  a grass-roots revolution to take policy-making
and  control  of the Net out of the hands of the few and put it into the
hands of those who use the Net

STOP THE INTERNET COUP

Assn.   for  Interactive Media demands an end to the hostile takeover of
the Internet by the International Ad Hoc Committee

Defend  your  Internet  rights  by  opposing  the gTLD-MoU, the Internet
Society, and IANA


Washington, D.C.  (July 11, 1997) The stability of the Internet is being
threatened  by an attempted takeover by a group from Geneva known as the
International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC).  Internet-based business and user
have  been  taken  unawares  by a power grab orchestrated by a technical
group  with  no  legal authority.  The Association for Interactive Media
and  the Open Internet Congress have called for everyone in the Internet
community to oppose this move.

Takeover  plans  are  detailed  in a recent memorandum by IAHC regarding
issues  related  to  assigning domain names to Internet users.  IAHC was
assigned  to meet to discuss the possibility of making more domain names
available.   When  they  released their final report, called the Generic
Top  Level  Domain  Memorandum  of Understanding (gTLD-MoU), it actually
contained  the  structure  for a world government for the Internet.  The
leaders  of  the  IAHC,  including the Internet Society and the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority, have installed themselves as leaders of this
government.

Businesses  are  being pushed to sign the gTLD-MoU in a global effort by
IAHC.   This  document  is  disguised as an innocent standards agreement
regarding  domain  names.   It  is  actually  a  treaty that it actually
assigns  permanent  control over the Internet to six tightly controlled,
non-representative   organizations.    There   are   no  provisions  for
elections,  representation,  or  input  from  consumers,  business,  and
governments.

Make  no  mistake If you sign the gTLD-MoU, you will give up all of your
rights  to  have any say on the structure and management of the internet
forever.    said  Andy  Sernovitz,  president  of  the  Association  for
Interactive  Media.   A  group of self-appointed autocrats have declared
themselves  rulers  of the Internet without regard to international law,
the  stability  of  the  Internet,  and  the  rights  of  you  and  your
organization.

 The  Open  Internet  Congress  (OIC)  was  founded to fight for an open
process  that  guarantees  that all of the Internets stakeholders have a
fair and representative voice in its management and operations.  OIC has
called   for  an  Internet  Constitutional  Convention  to  develop  the
representative  process.  An organizational meeting will be held July 9,
1997 in Washington, D.C., and is open to all.

Founded  in  1993,  the  Association  for  Interactive Media is the most
diverse coalition of organizational users of the Internet, with over 300
members.   AIMs  mission  is  to  support  the  efforts  of leaders from
for-profit  and  non-profit  organizations  seeking  to serve the public
through  interactive  media.   With the ability to form partnerships and
friendships  among a wide variety of organizations, AIM bridges the gaps
between  groups  working  in  dozens  of  different fields to ensure the
successful future of new media.


IMPORTANT FACTS

Who  is  staging this coup, and how do they plan on pulling it off?  The
gTLD-MoU  gives permanent control of the Internet to:  Internet Society,
Internet   Assigned  Numbers  Authority,  Internet  Architecture  Board,
International  Telecommunications  Union,  World  Intellectual  Property
Organization,   and  International  Trademark  Association.   They  have
already  declared  control.   They  have created an organization to take
control,  appointed  themselves  leaders  of  it, and have begun issuing
technical  orders  to  Internet  server  operators.   They have publicly
declared  that  they  do not need the support of governments, consumers,
and  businesses because "the committee says it has direct control of the
computers that run the Net's addressing system." (CNET, 5/2/97)

What happens to the Internet if they succeed?  The Internet is likely to
break apart on October 15, 1997.  That is the date that the coup leaders
intend  to  re-route  the Internet to be under their control against the
advice  of  those who keep things running smoothly today.  When they rip
the  essential root servers off the Internet backbone, the entire system
may  begin  to  fragment.  Your email will be returned and your Web site
visitors  will  be  turned  away.   These  organizations have refused to
recognize  the  validity  of  the registries that ensure that traffic is
successfully delivered to ".com", ".org", and ".net" addresses.  Serious
concern has arisen over the possibility of malicious viruses and "Trojan
Horses" being hidden in the software that runs the Internet.

What  happens  to me and my business if they succeed?  You are likely to
lose  access  to  reliable  Internet  communications.   Control  of your
trademarks  on  the  Internet  will  be given up.  You will be forced to
submit  to  binding  decisions  made  by  a  "challenge panel" in Geneva
created and run by this group.  If you lose, you will not be able to use
your  trademark  in  your domain name someone else will.  You will never
have a voice in the governance of the Internet.  You will not be able to
effectively  defend yourself, your organization, and your rights against
future moves by these aggressors.

What  should  I  do?   Do  not sign the gTLD-MOU!  Sign up with the Open
Internet  Congress  to secure your place in the decision-making process.
Contact  the  OIC  immediately  to get involved.  Help us gather support
from  governments,  consumers, and businesses.  Distribute this document
to all of your email lists as soon as possible.
