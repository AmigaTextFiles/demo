Unix gives hackers a crack at systems 
By Larry Lange, August 26, 1996
Electronic Engineering Times, p62
----

   Las Vegas: Many of the hacking elite were on the Internet
   long before the World Wide Web was a gleam in the eye of
   inventor Tim Berners Lee. And these folks know the
   best-kept secret of gaining access to-and control
   of-someone else's electronic property: Unix.

   Developed in the days of governmental and academic
   cooperation and collaboration, the Unix operating system
   began as a powerful way of remotely logging on to other
   computers. As such, it helped spawn the network that
   eventually became the Internet. The early Unix gurus
   weren't thinking about criminal activity; most were
   scientists and engineers who exploited the breakthrough
   simply to work collaboratively on projects, proud of the
   open standards they had built into the OS.

   But the advent of the Web has spawned a Gold Rush
   mentality among corporations, many of which are
   accustomed to the PC environment and are thus cobbling
   together Unix-based networks managed by overhyped and
   underwhelming security systems.

   The result: Despite the seemingly mandatory corporate use
   of such programs as firewalls, the U.S. Secret Service
   reports that "Web tampering has become more visible and
   more reported in the past 12 months." An expert
   underground Web cracker who goes by the handle +ORC noted
   with apparent glee: "With each company that connects to
   the Net, new frontiers are created for crackers to
   explore."

   Indeed, even as many old-line hackers of the sort who
   gathered here recently for the DefCon convention go
   legit, some starting cyber-security companies of their
   own, Internet-security experts look with trepidation to
   the next, more threatening wave of cybercrime.

   "Hacking as we know it is dying," DefCon founder Dark
   Tangent, a.k.a. Jeff Moss, told EE Times at the
   conference. "Everything is specialized today. There's
   wireless, IP, ISDN, NT -- it gets crazy." As he edges
   into his mid-20s, Moss said he has wearied of the
   lifestyle and concedes the technology as well. "I'm not
   going to rewrite a Unix kernel," he said.

   Moss said the next wave of hacking will be fraught with
   "industrial espionage, data manipulation and every
   conceivable type of electronic fraud, to the point where
   corporations won't be able to cope."

   Why are corporations so vulnerable, and how do hackers or
   crackers -- those doing patently illegal computer
   activity, as opposed to pranks -- get in? For starters,
   said Web cracker +ORC, the "sysops [system operators] are
   not firewall administrators, and many of them know
   nothing about the software they use."

   The firewall solution works by examining the Internet
   protocol (IP) packets that travel between the server and
   client. Packets that go through the firewall, such as
   Web-browsing requests, can reveal to a remote site
   essential information about a network's configuration --
   such as the IP address -- that, in turn, can be used to
   break into that network.

   "If a site has a firewall," said +ORC, "decisions have
   been made as to what is allowed across it. These
   decisions are always incomplete, and given the
   multiplicity of the Net, there are always loopholes a
   cracker can capitalize on."

   The screened-host-gateway firewall is a fairly easy type
   to crack, said +ORC. Since the bastion host in that kind
   of firewall is protected from the outside net by the
   screening router, the router is generally configured to
   allow only traffic from specific ports on the host. "But
   if the router allows a service such as Usenet news
   traffic to reach the bastion host," +ORC said, "this
   filtering can be easily cracked," since it relies on a
   remote machine's IP address, which can be forged.

   "Most sites configure their router such that any
   connection initiated from the inside net is allowed to
   pass, by examining the SYN and ACK bits of Transmission
   Control Protocol [TCP] packets," explained +ORC. "The
   start-of-connection packet will have both bits set, and
   if this packet's source address is internal -- or seems
   to be internal -- the packet is allowed to pass, and
   you're in."

   Sniffer approach

   Another way hackers gain access is by using so-called
   "sniffer" software to capture passwords.

   A sniffer is a network-monitoring tool that enters a
   system and detects the first 120 keystrokes of a newly
   opened Internet session -- i.e. a user's host, account
   and password information.

   Though holes in Unix programs have been probed, patched
   and plugged, crackers still find that many corporations
   allow easy access through Anonymous FTP, Telnet, rlogin,
   Mount, Finger and sendmail programs. A reading of this
   naive software company promo at DefCon brought down the
   house:"Yes! We offer the new, more secure version of
   sendmail!"

   Since by default, sendmail -- or the Simple Mail Transfer
   Protocol (SMTP) -- accepts a message from any incoming
   connection, the sender of such a message can appear to
   have originated anywhere. "Therefore, any claim of
   identity will be accepted," said +ORC. "Thus, you can
   forge a message's originator."

   As the technology gets more complex, the hackers get
   smarter. Renowned Java hacker Yobie Benjamin sums it up:
   "No matter what you do, and no matter how much you spend
   to protect your systems, if somebody wants to get in
   there bad enough, they will."

   As a typical representative of the teen hacker going
   straight, Christian Valor -- known in the hacker
   community as Se7en -- said specialization is fraying the
   once tight-knit community.

   "There's cellular, Internet, encryption -- all have
   different standards and different skills," he said. "It's
   not like it used to be when I'd get root access [to a
   system using Unix]. I was a master."

   Valor, who has had numerous run-ins with the law, said
   he's tired of that lifestyle. "I don't want to hide
   anymore. I've been doing this for 12 years."

   Outlaw skills

   As old-school hackers like Valor go straight, many are
   bringing the skills they developed as outlaws into the
   system (see Aug. 19, page 4). DefCon founder Moss, for
   example, is dipping a toe in Web-site design. "I'm going
   to give a shot at a content-creation business-even if it
   fails, I'll still be young enough to recover." Meanwhile,
   however, his DefCon T-shirts were doing a brisk business
   at the conference.

   With the look of a young corporate security consultant,
   Moss, an ex-law student, said he started DefCon four
   years ago "as a way to meet the people on the other side
   of the screen from Internet Relay Chat and Usenet
   groups." He chose Las Vegas as the ideal location because
   "even if it gets screwed up, we can still salvage a good
   time."

   But the stakes have changed for Moss and DefCon. In fact,
   this convention could only find booking at the
   ultra-lavish Monte Carlo hotel, because it had just
   opened; Moss has been banned from every other place in
   town because of his crowd's past hacking pranks and rowdy
   behavior.

   The commercialization of hacking began with a bold move a
   few years ago by onetime hacker king Erik Bloodaxe (Chris
   Goggans), who spun 180 degrees to form Computer Security
   Technologies Inc., Austin, Texas. Goggans has also worked
   on security for Dell Computer Corp. and UUNet.

   Perhaps the legendary hacker group l0pht is the best
   example of the thin line between cybercriminal and
   corporate comer. Several members spoke at DefCon, notably
   Death Vegetable, administrator of the Cult of the Dead
   Cow and media poster boy for Internet bomb postings (he
   was raked over by the national press after a juvenile
   downloaded his postings, made a bomb and accidentally
   blew off several fingers); and Mudge, the brilliant
   encryption cracker who devised the S/Key Cracker's
   Toolkit and posted it on the Net, much to the chagrin of
   Bellcore, S/Key's owners. S/Key is an Internet
   password-protection scheme.

   Even these bad boys of the Internet are going legit: l0pht
   is a fledgling Internet services provider, offering FTP,
   Unix-shell and Web-page accounts to corporations and
   consumers alike.

   But even though l0pht is quickly building a mainstream
   following, the group maintains scads of hacking and
   cracking information on their site (www.l0pht.com). In
   the same way, the world of semi-innocent hacking and
   phreaking will probably live on indefinitely.
