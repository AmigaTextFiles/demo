A reply to Bucko/¡ND¡ replying to an article by me...
<font color =#D0DCFF>
(Some new readers may not know what the hell I'm wibbling on about, just
get hold of issue #11 &amp; #12 to find out)
<font color =#FFFFFF>
I also think there MIGHT be a higher entity or entities that created the
<font color =#FFFFF4>first  single-celled  organisms  that we evolved from.  Ignoring all
the  pollution  and  wars,  etc, I think mankind (did you read that word
girls?
<font color =#FFFFE8>That  word  was  MANkind  :)  are  pretty  intelligent  blokies (and
blokettes).   Shite,  I've  totally  forgotten  what  I was gonna write,
better start 
<font color =#FFFFDC>again...

What proof has there been that there IS a God?  From what we've seen,
<font color =#FFFFD0>something  like God just wouldn't exist.  I'm guessing here, but God
would *HAVE* to be some kind of energy form, but where did this engergy
<font color =#FFFFC4>come  from?   It  obviously  couldn't  have been caused by a massive
explosion (how can something intelligent be created by a random
<font color =#FFFFB8>explosion,  according  to my personal experience, explosions are not
good  things,  as  they  hurt  and  make  yer willy shrink; also how can
something
<font color =#FFFFAC>be  created  from  a random (or was it?) explosion have the power to
create things?).

<font color =#FFFFA0>People  wibble  (I  luv  that  word!)  on  about humans being a mega
complex  organism  and  a  "masterstroke  of design" (your words Bucko).
Acccording
<font color =#FFFF94>to  *us*, yes we appear to be.  But say if there was a God (if there
were more than one God, would the other(s) interfere with anyone else's
<font color =#FFFF88>"creation"  ?   Or was it a joint project?), we could very well be a
crap  creation  and "a bit dodgy" in our design (c'mon, can someone tell
me the
<font color =#FFFF7C>point  of  earwax?).   Also, we aren't very robust are we?  If a fat
bloke  (me) gave a skinny bloke (Timmy Mallet) a good kick, he'd shatter
into a
<font color =#FFFF70>squillion pieces.

We may be a shite creation by God, and God just couldn't be BUMHOLED to
<font color =#FFFF64>nuke  us,  so  he  left us to see what would happen in a few billion
years time.  Obviously he hasn't come back to see how we're doing.

<font color =#FFFF58>Of  course  10  years  to us would be wildy different to 10 years to
God.  As we totally made up time ourselves (so I assume).  So, does time
<font color =#FFFF4C>itself  exist?   As  we  had  to make up some kind of time reference
didn't  we?   Only  because  we  created  it,  doesn't  mean  it  exists
everywhere else, does it?
<font color =#FFC44C> &gt;"Man (and before anyone thinks I am getting sexist I will use this
term
<font color =#FFC458>&gt;as a generic name for our species) is a hugeley complex organism, a
&gt;masterstroke of design (well, apart form the wars we cause, and
<font color =#FFC464>
&gt;pollution and stuff :) and something that I beleive could not have come
&gt;about  by  chance.   Sureley  evolution, the universe and everything we
know
<font color =#FFC470>&gt;was not simply a stroke of luck??"
<font color =#F4FF4C>
Why  couldn't  we  have come around by chance?  I see what you mean when
you say that, but we very well may have.
<font color =#E8FF4C>
Like for example, lets talk about random-ness.  The whole point to it is
that it's unpredictable and you don't know the outcome (or else it
<font color =#DCFF4C>wouldn't  be  random, would it (I think)?).  The Lottery numbers, do
you remember when they came out as 16, 17 and 18 (and such like) ?  It's
<font color =#D0FF4C>just because it JUST HAPPENED that way, just like the universe.  The
universe JUST HAPPENED.
<font color =#C4FF4C>
When  "The  Big-Bang"  happened (God knows how that `explosion' happened
:), everything started hurtling outwards (as it does in any kind of
<font color =#B8FF4C>explosion)  and started spreading out.  The universe (as we know it,
ie.   everything  that  was  created from the big boom) has been cooling
down,
<font color =#ACFF4C>and  when  things cool down, they sometimes change.  For example, if
you have plastic that is so hot, it's in a liquid form, and you wait for
it
<font color =#A0FF4C>to cool down, it basically changes form from liquid in to a solid.

So when the particles, etc started to cool down and mix together, they
<font color =#A0FF58>created  new particles, molicules, etc.  Just like mixing two things
together normally results in something pretty different.  So when a lot
<font color =#A0FF64>of  things  start  a  mixing  `n' mashing, you end up with some very
different sort'a stuff.  Various particles get caught up with each other
<font color =#A0FF70>and  start  getting  fused together (remember it's still pretty damn
hot)  which  starts  to form solids when they do eventually get at a low
temp
<font color =#A0FF7C>(like  that hot plastic.  Who cares if the plaggy was already solid,
if you're thinking that, then you're missing my real point).

<font color =#A0FF88>God.   Is  it  a  he,  she  or an it ?  Well, I'd say an "it".  Why?
Well, if there's only one God, why have any re-productive organs?  So if
it's
<font color =#A0FF94>haven't  got  any tits/a nob/etc then it's not a he OR a she, is it?
As we seem to class species on what parts they've got.
<font color =#FFC44C>
<font color =#FFC458>
&gt;"All the tribes of man that the world has ever known have worshipped
<font color =#FFC464>
&gt;gods.   This  is a bit of a coincidence is it not?  Surely there should
be
<font color =#FFC470>
&gt;some Aithiest tribes amongst man if there truely were no god?"
<font color =#A0FFA0>
No,  it's not a coincidence.  Whoever started spouting shite about there
being a God must have defined it the way that person(s) would want it to
<font color =#A0FFAC>be  like.   Obviously,  not everyones' ideals are the same, so other
tribes  started  to  believe in "God", but they imagined it the way they
wanted it
<font color =#A0FFB8>to  be.   Coz  if you made something up, you'd want it to be the way
YOU wanted it, wouldn't you?  Unless you were an extremely stupid/kind
<font color =#A0FFC4>person!

I don't suppose we'll ever know if the Bible is the true book of the
<font color =#A0FFD0>God(s).   I  don't  really  know  if  we'll  truly ever find out why
everything  started, but until we do, I don't think I'll be believing in
a "God" of
<font color =#A0FFDC>some/any sort.

You're probably thinking why the hell I'm so bluddy well sure that God
<font color =#A0FFE8>doesn't  exist  and  think everything "just happened" when I haven't
got  any concrete proof that God DOESN'T exist.  Well...  I don't really
know
<font color =#A0FFF4>why  I  think that, but I suppose it's just that HOW does God exist?
What is God?  Where'd God come from, and other such questions ...

<font color =#A0FFFF>Nothing  is  quite we what expect (when Pong first came out (I don't
think  I  was  even  born  at  the time (1979 was when I was born)), who
could've
<font color =#A0F4FF>thought  that we'd be playing games like Tekken 3 and Tomb Raider?).
Who  would've  thought  the  earth was infact a sphere instead if a cube
type of
<font color =#A0E8FF>shape?   I  know  that  sounds stupid, but people DID think that you
could fall off the end of the earth.  Infact, some crew members on ships
would
<font color =#A0DCFF>kill their captain if he went too far to the "edge" of the earth.

But  the very ultimate question....  who thought people would drink that
<font color =#A0D0FF>bloody horrible RED Punica !?¿?

                          &lt;a week later .....&gt;

So,  this one thing ("God") created absolutely EVERYTHING in 6 days (the
7th  day being the so-called "resting day") ?  BULLOCKS!  Soon we're all
gonna  die  because  of  the  way we've fucked up the planet, and do you
think  we'll  get any help from this so-called God?  I don't bladdy well
think so.

What's  one of the major causes of death in the world?  Religion, that's
bluddy what.  I don't give a fuck if Jesus did sacrifice himself for the
whole  of  mankind  to  wash away their sins.  I haven't read that shite
called  "The Bible", but didn't Jesus sacrifice himself to stop God (you
fuckwit!)  nuking  everyone/thing on earth?  If God/Jesus/etc did exist,
why  the fuck is everyone praising GOD, and not Jesus instead??  God was
gonna  fuckin'  kill everyone!!  God, you are a WANKER!  C'mon you arse,
I'll challenge you to a game of Mortal Kombat III (I'm the BEST!) ....

Who sez that Jesus (Christ Superstar!  Ooh ahh, who'd you think you are?
Some  kind  of  superstar?  That lives in a car?  With a 7 par?  Print a
var.   Drink  some  tar.   Eat  a  bar.  Sorry.) was born on the 25th of
December?   Other  religions  say he was born on the 2nd January, others
say the 7th.  So who's right then, eh?  $fff
             [Me! I say he was born yesterday &lt;smirk&gt; - D!]
<font color =#A0D0FF>
Time doesn't exist, we just made it up (see why above).

Lemme  get  this right, God and Satan (nice word by the way!  A bit like
satin)  have  to  try  and  get  as  many people (more like "slaves") as
possible  to  follow  them,  right?   So  everyone  that believes in God
obviously  are followers of God, and ditto for the Mr Satan.  What about
the  poeple  that  are "in-different" ?  I take it these are ignored, or
are  they  just  nuked  for  a  laff?   So  anyone  that's in Heaven are
"following" God, and anyone in Hell are "following" Satan, right?  Damn,
I've  just thought ahead of what I was gonna type, but I've just totally
destroyed this example!  Duh!  ....

How  come everything that is considered "evil" is always good (shagging,
thinking  norty  thoughts,  twatting  someone that has just twatted you,
getting a load of bubble-wrap and thing wringing it out like a flanal so
it  makes  loads of "popping" sounds, instead of popping each individual
bubble  (you  boring  farty!);  etc),  and  things  considered "good" is
boring?

Sorry,  but if shagging/etc is considered evil and you get sent to Hell,
then  Hell  sounds like a bluddy groovy place (apart from the burning in
eternal  flames poo thing)!  So if anyone follows Satan, they'll burn in
an  eternal  fire?  Then why the HELL (geddit?  Ho ho!) worship Satan if
he's gonna torch ya?  Oh well, don't take anything warm with you, you'll
get  a bit hot ....  take a flask of cold orange, a knackered comb, some
sandles and a nice book on DIY bog-roll ....


<font color =#DCDCDC>Sorry, but I've got to cut this article short.... see ya!
