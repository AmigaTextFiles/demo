I've decided to review some films seen as how I watch so many each week.
These  may  not  be the latest releases but they are ones I like and may
interest  you  just in case you have not sen them yet.  The idea of film
recommendations  has  been on the minds of many people lately and if you
have  internet  access and want to check out what films might be up your
alley then check out "www.moviecritic.com".  Untill then read on..

Title : Adventures In Babysitting
Rating: 6/10

 Starring  a  then  relatively unknown Elizabeth Shue as the babysitter.
She has to babysit a young girl and her slightly older brother who has a
crush  on  Shue.  Combined with the boys best friend, the foursome go on
an adventure through Manhatten when Shue's friend calls to say she's ran
away from home and is stuck at a bus depot without any money.
 The  journey features being chased by car thieves, scared shitless by a
pickup-truck driver with a hook for a hand and hanging out of skyscraper
windows and crashing the odd party and blues club.
 Well worth seeing just for the opening scene where Miss Shue dances all
over her bed miniming to a song.

Title : American Yakuza
Rating: 5/10

 First  of  3  films  based around the relationship between the east and
west today (other two being Blue Tiger and White Tiger).
 In  it,  the main character saves the life of a Japanese Yakuza (mafia)
boss  and  is  rewarded  with  membership  into the organisation.  He is
however  an undercover cop but he falls in love with a Japanese lady and
becomes  friends with the Yakuza boss.  Lots of martial arts scenes make
up  for  some crap twists in the storyline but the overall film is a lot
better than most John Woo films I've seen to date.

Title : Army Of Darkness (aka: Evil Dead III)
Rating: 7/10

 I've  never  seen Evil Dead I, but I did see Evil Dead II and I thought
it was pretty gruesome but then I was never into Horror.  I saw a review
of Army Of Darkness and figured I'd give it a try.  I was quite suprised
to  discover  it was a Horror/Comedy.  The first of it's type I had come
across.   It  completly takes the piss out of horror in my opinion.  The
main  character  is  transported  to  a time and place where everyone is
dressed  as knights of the round table sorta-thing and there are witches
and  evil  monsters  etc.  However he has a pump action shotgun which he
calls  his "fire stick" which he uses to blow the top of a knights sword
who  swings  it in his direction.  His other hand is missing (cut-off in
Evil  Dead II by himself when it became possesed) and in it's place is a
chainsaw  which  sometimes refuses to start and when it does it is ideal
for cutting witches heads off.

You'll laugh your head off at this!

Title : Assassins
Rating: 8/10

 The  constant  use  of  laptops, mobile phones and hacker techniques in
this  film  made  it a winner in my opinion instantly.  Stallone plays a
hitman who wishes to retire but has to do one last job before hand.  The
second  best  assassin  has  other  ideas  though because he wants to be
number one and wishes to permanently retire Stallone.
 In  comes Electra (Julliane Moore) an attractive information hacker who
Stallone  spares  and  uses  to  help  him get rid of the other assassin
(Banderas) and to deliver an encrypted disk to some Dutch buyers for the
payment he needs to retire on.

Well worth seeing just for the hotel scenes.

Title : Bladerunner
Rating: 9/10

 A  classic.   Where  "War  Games"  is regarded as the film that spawned
great  interest  in the hacker culture, "Bladerunner" is said to of done
the same with the cyberpuk culture.  Pre-Gibsonian, this film shows us a
popular  culture  where  there  is  a  great oriental infulence (also as
Gibson   predicted   in   Neuromancer).    Robots  are  brought  to  the
sophistication  of  the Nexus models which look human.  Several of these
"replicants"  escape  from  their  mining  colony  as their life time is
almost  up  and  they  want  to  live  longer.   Harrison Ford plays the
bladerunner, a cop who hunts down replicants.
 This  film  set  the  level  at  which  all  other cyberpunk films must
compete.   Stylish  backgrounds  featuring a product-orientated lanscape
with  huge  billboards  on  the side of billboards and good-year blimps.
Bladerunner  has  become  a  cult film with a huge gathering on the net.
You cannot call yourself a cyberpunk unless you have seen this film.

Title : The Chase
Rating: 6/10

 Charlie  Sheen plays a guy who was mistaken as a bank robber dressed as
a  clown.   He  escapes from jail to end up facing 2 dumb policemen in a
petrol  station  shop.   Kidnapping  a young girl and taking her red BMW
they  proceed  to mexico with a load of cop cars and news helicopters in
tow.
 An  extremly  funny  chase  movie where the main set is the inside of a
car.  The best scenes are where he sticks a gun out of a window to scare
off  an  approaching  cop  car  but he hit's a stone in the road causing
himself to accidentally fire the gun blowing out the cop cars front tyre
so  it  somersaults  across  the road.  The reporters then report him as
being  "an  expert  marksman".   Or  where a truck carrying corpses to a
medical  centre  spills  them  across  the  road and over the front of a
trailing cop car.

I guarantee you'll find this film very funny.

Title : Cherry 2000
Rating: 8/10

 A  B-movie that is actually pretty good.  Set in the future where there
is  a  shortage  of  women.  Several companies have been specialising in
female  models  that  do  everything  a  real  woman  does  (without the
nagging).   Their  memory is stored on a small compact disk which can be
removed.   While making love to his model one night it accidentally gets
water past it's outer skin layer resulting in a short circuit.  Removing
the  memory chip (personality of the model) our main character must find
a replacement model.  A local dealer offers him several models but tells
him  that  his  current  model is beyond repair and they do not make the
"Cherry  2000"  model  any  more.   Asking  if  there are any in storage
anywhere  he  is  told  there  maybe  one  but  it's in an old warehouse
situated in the badlands which is now ruled by bandits.
 He then hire's a tracker (Melanie Griffith) to get him to the warehouse
situated  in  what  was  Las  Vegas.   The  two travel the badlands in a
cutomised red Ford Mustang through desert and underground pipelines.
 The  story  is a pretty good sci-fi featuring well known sci-fi actors.
The main point the film gets across is if you had the choice of the real
thing or a robot, which would you choose?

One of my long time favourites.

Title : Concierge
Rating: 8/10

 Little Michael.J.Fox grows on you after a while.  Ever watch Spin City?
In  this he play's the concierge of a large hotel.  In a way the film is
a  sort  of  comedy  even  though it tries to be romantic at times.  The
party  gate  crashing  scene  reminds me of "A weekend At Bernies" and I
kinda  like  the way his character can smooth talk anyone and palm money
at the same time.

Well worth seeing!

Title : Crash
Rating: 6/10

 At  the time this was released I had read a review saying a film called
CRASH was really horny and another saying it was Cyberpunk.  This turned
out  to  be  neither.   I was confused and later discovered 3 films were
released  around the same time with the same name!  A japanese cyberpunk
film  was  released,  a  film  about  getting  off  on car accidents was
released and so was this one.
 Starring  Michael  Biehn  (terminator).   This  is  one hell of a fast,
action  paced  movie  centred  around  the fact that mobsters want their
compact  disk back and the guy that has it doesn't want to give it back.
Biehn  teams  up  with  a  female  undercover cop through this explosive
action  movie  with non stop firefights with bullets and bodies spraying
everywhere.

Sort  of  an  american  John  Woo  style film with some hard core action
styles I ain't seen before thrown in.

Title : The Crow
Rating: 9/10

 Another  one of my favourite films.  The whole film is shot in a gothic
landscape  where it never appears to have a day.  A guy and his girl are
killed  by  a local gang.  A year later he comes back with the help of a
crow to exact revenge.  Technically however he is not alive and therefoe
shooting/stabbing him doesn't seem to do anything.
 My  favourite  scenes  are  at  the  pawnbrokers  where the owner keeps
shooting  him  and  the  bullets  keep going through him and as he walks
closer  the  guy  keeps  pulling the trigger saying "shit on me, shit on
me!!!".  Also where he is on top of the buildings playing his guitar!

Worth seeing no matter what you are into!

Title : Cyborg 2 : Glass Shadow
Rating: 6/10

 This  has  nothing to do with the origonal Cyborg film starring our man
Claude.   In  fact it's a seperate film altogether in my opinion.  A man
at  a  cyborg teaching facility falls for a female cyborg due to be sent
on  a  suicide mission.  He frees her but the company send people out to
get  him.   This  feels  like  Bladerunner  but not quite.  The woman is
gorgeous  (Angeline Jolie from hackers) and so are the sets.  The ending
gives food for thought.

A film for any cyberpunk who hasn't seen it yet.

Title : Dunston Checks In
Rating: 7/10

 This  is  a  comedy aimed at anybody.  Based in a hotel ran by a father
who has 2 sons who enjoy using the hotel as their private game room.  An
english  guest  brings  a  monkey  (Dunston)  with him in order to steal
jewelery  from  various  guests  rooms  and  escape  via the side of the
building.
 This will appeal to anyone who wants to spend an hour or so laughing at
the slightest stupid thing (like I do).

Title : Fair Game
Rating: 8/10

 Supposed  to  be  crap  because Cindy Crawford is in it (non of you lot
should be saying "who?") but it's actually quite good.  Crawford plays a
lawyer who is defending the wife of a criminal.  She gets custody of the
guys  boat  which  he needs for his illegal tapping of the undersea bank
lines so he can commit wire fraud.  He is in partnership with a bunch of
ex-special  force russians who send out teams to illimate Miss Crawford.
She  is  protected  by  William  Baldwin, a cop whose CV should prove an
interesting  read  if the skills he uses in this film are anything to go
by.
 The  film  is action packed with chases, shoot outs and enough intrigue
and  use of computers that it should interest you lot reading this.  The
scene where the russian's use thermal imaging cameras to track body heat
in  a  hotel  is pretty cool because they can't see the cop because he's
having a cold shower (after taking a long look at Miss Crawfords legs no
doubt).

If you want a Die Hard type action movie then watch this!

Title : Ferris Beullers Day Off
Rating: 7/10

 I  used  to watch this a lot when it first came out.  It's a manual for
anyone  wishing  to  skip  school and have some fun!  All the stars have
gone  on  to become major stars these days but this film never gets old!
It's a comedy exploring what school/college kids have to look forward to
when  they have to leave school.  Get's deep at times but the soundtrack
and  stupid headmaster make up for any lack of relevance to anything but
truancy that may creep in.
