                                By D!ck

First, kill two mice and cut off their tails, there should be four wires
in  each  tail  (we're  talking  PC  mice here), Orange, Green, Blue and
White.   Strip  and tin both sets of four wires and solder them together
as follows...

                       Orange ------------  Green

                       Green  ------------ Orange

                       Blue   ------------   Blue

                       White  ------------  White


Make  sure  that  all  individual  wires are insulated so that spikes of
solder do not short on other lines, and there you have it, a perfect COM
cable,  which will work with Quake and quite probably a few other games,
as well as Hyperterminal for file transfer.

With  Hyperterminal you can run quite happily at speeds of 115200, which
will  give you a serial transfer rate of just over 11k a second, not bad
for a cable made of a couple of pieces of scrap!

[Cool  idea!   It would save me buying a proper serial cable adaptor for
my laptop as well.  Only probably is I only have one PC mouse and it's a
new 6900dpi one!  Anyone got any dead PC mice they don't want?  Kei]
