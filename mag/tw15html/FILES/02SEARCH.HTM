                                by D!ck

There  are  ways  and  means  to  do  everything, one of the most useful
aspects  of  the  internet  is the ability to use search engines to hunt
down  a  specific  topic,  and  it would enhance your page no end if you
could  give  people  the  option  to search from it for pages of similar
interest.

Take,  for  example,  Jenny  Powell  (oh shut up you lot, just because I
*like*  Jenny  Powell okay?), I have an Jenny Powell section on my page,
so  it  would  be  cool  if  I  could add a gadget that would search the
internet for other occurrences of our Jen, right?

OK, bad example, there isn't an awful lot of Jenny Powell out there, but
this IS only an example after all!

First  of  all,  decide which search engine you're going to use, for the
purposes of the example we'll use Yahoo UK, many people will be familiar
with it so it's a good place to start.

Create the link for your search engine, you can make it a fancy gfx link
if you want, but for now we'll stick to a text link:

     Search on &lt;A HREF=""&gt;Yahoo&lt;?A&gt; For Jenny Powell

This  won't  do  anything,  obviously, because there's no URL to link to
just yet, we'll get that now.

Go  to  Yahoo, that's www.yahoo.co.uk for us, and do a search for "Jenny
Powell"  (include  the quotes).  You'll notice a few answers come up but
that's not what you're interested in.

Look  at  the  top  of the page where the URL is, instead of what you've
just typed in you should see...

 http://av.yahoo.co.uk/bin/query_uk?p=%22Jenny+Powell%22&amp;hc=0&amp;hs=0

This is a call to Yahoo with loads of parameters, you can drop this into
any browser at any time and it will perform a search on Yahoo for "Jenny
Powell"  (in  quotes, so you won't get Jenny Agutter and Enoch Powell by
mistake).

All  you  have to do no, is chop that entire line out of the URL box and
paste it between the quotes in your Text Link (in HREF="") and save your
document.   Upload  your  HTML  onto  the net and try it out online, you
should jump to a Yahoo page that has just conducted a search for you.

The  handy  bit  here  is that you do not have to keep updating a set of
links,  just  point  your  user  in  the direction of Yahoo or any other
search engine (repeat the above process for any you want to include) and
they  will  be  presented  with a list of sites mathching the query, and
Yahoo will have kept it updated, not you.

If  you  use this idea, please credit me by inserting the following line
of  text  into your site document (I've split it up to fit on the screen
but you can stick it all on one line) somewhere:

   Search idea by
   &lt;A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/2020/"&gt;

Feel  free  to visit my site - always under construction - and ask about
anything that interests you there.

[Most  users  of  the internet that consider themselves more experienced
with  searching  will  recommend  AltaVista  (www.altavista.digital.com)
because  it  searches 90% of the internet (Web and USENET).  It's run by
DEC  (Digital  Electronics  Corporation)  and powered by their DEC Alpha
machines  which  are supplied to Yahoo as well.  If you want to get more
out of searching the net then I recommend this book:

The AltaVista Search Revolution : How to find anything on the internet
