I`ve  just  used  the  cheat mode on readysofts game "dragons lair 3" to
view  the  full game as it is far too hard to complete by natural means.
I have no problem with the game just that it was made for non aga amigas
in  1992  and  has  the best graphics I have ever seen on a game,they`re
bright and colorfull and look just like a cartoon.

Now  the  thing  I  am  so  disgusted  with  is why doesn`t someone from
readysoft  or some other software company (maybe even you) make some gfx
like these,add some well animated characters and challenging puzzles and
make it the best adventure on the amiga ever?

Just  look  at  the  gfx  on  this game and they should make you believe
enough that the amiga can do us proud.

Sure  the  game was on 8 disks but wait a moment,there were about 50 odd
locations  in the game with many characters plus speech.  So add 50 more
rooms,make  it  aga  only (2mb min) and hd installable only (because the
game loads slowly) archive the files and you ahould have a award winning
game on about 20 disks,so come on somebody please do it now!!!!!!!!!


Thanks.

Bye  the  way if you were wondering why I cant do it,it`s because I cant
code,write music or anything to do with programming.Soz!
