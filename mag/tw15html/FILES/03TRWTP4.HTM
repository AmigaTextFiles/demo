Level 13 Natla's Mines - Items: 26 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 3

Lara begins this level underwater and stripped of all weapons.  Swim for
the  waterfall  and  surface  behind it.  Go down the tunnel and use the
switch on the left to open a door.  Go back to the falls and dive in and
swim  to the other side.  Climb out and enter the tunnel to the right of
the  crate.   Find the block and pull it out of the mound then enter the
passage  it  was  blocking.   Use  the switch to open a second door then
return to the water and the boat.

Swim  back  to  the  falls and go down that passage again.  Climb to the
sloped  passage  and  follow  it  until  you  can jump to a ledge with a
barricade it.  Follow the tunnel to a room with a large glass structure.
Get  the  medkit then enter the next room with the two condemned houses.
Find  and pull the block out twice towards some tires then hop ontop and
jump  to  the  roof of the house.  You'll fall through and end up inside
where  you can go down a tunnel and use a switch to make the boat return
to the dock.

Go  to the end of the tunnel and slide down grabbing the right ledge and
dropping  to the ground.  Follow the tracks to the wood door which opens
for you.  Now comes the TRICKY PART!  Do this exactly!

- Walk towards the first barricade until the boulder begins to roll.
- Jump the first barricade then do a series of running jumps to get over
  the other 3.
- As you jump the 3rd barricade turn to the right in mid-air to land on
  a hill and enter the passage before the boulder flattens you.

If  you were successful then Indiana Jones would be proud, otherwise you
will need to return to the first barricade and try again.

Inside  the  tunnel  get the fuse.  Head up until another boulder starts
rollings  then  run back and to the left.  Go up the hill on the left as
another  boulder rolls by.  Drop into the hole at the top to reenter the
room  with  2  boulders.  Climb the hill to get back to those two houses
and  make your way back to the water with the boat.  Swim over and climb
into the boat then leap over to the crates.  Climb up the left crate and
find  the  tunnel  behind it.  Inside are lots of NATLA boxes and one of
them  is  a  "movable block".  Pull it once then push it left.  Now pull
the  box  behind  it  out  twice  and  pull it right to gain access to a
passage  with  another  switch.   Use  it  to  activate  the giant drill
machine.

Return  to the docs and go to tunnel to the right of the crates that the
drill  machine  HAD  been blocking.  Find and push a block forward until
you can enter the next room.  Get on the block and then climb up through
a  hole  to find another switch that opens another door.  Grab some ammo
for  your Uzi (in case you get it back) then drop back down.  Go forward
and into the next room and get another fuse then return to the docks and
make  your  way  back  to  those two houses.  Go inside the left one and
follow  the  tunnel inside to the fork where you can go left and use the
switch to start the conveyor belt.  Go back to the fork and find the 3rd
fuse  then return to the room with the glass structure and enter it from
the right.

Get  some  magnum  ammo  and  then  use the 3 fuses in the slots to gain
access  to  a  new  house.   Enter  the house and get the pistols before
climbing to the roof and jumping into the tunnel.  Just inside is a hole
which  you  can  jump  to  and  climb up.  A gate will open leading to a
deadly  trap.  The obvious trap door below will plunge you into hot lava
if  you stand on it so instead - slide down the slope backwards and grab
the  edge  as  you  fall.  Climb back up and the door will shut and stay
shut  from  now on.  Cross and get SECRET #1 - shells and Uzi clips then
use the switch to open the gate and return to the first tunnel.

Go to the end of the tunnel and do a safety drop then swim to the docks.
Exit  the  water and enter the tunnel with the drill machine.  Go around
the NATLA box and into the next tunnel where you find your magnums.  Too
bad  some  guy  is  using  them  to  blast  you.  Kill him as quickly as
possible  and  try not to fall in the lava tubes.  If he runs then chase
him.   Once  he  is  dead  take  your  hard earned magnums back and heal
yourself.

Leap  towards  the  switch on the far wall.  You just miss the ledge but
you can grab the ledge below taking a good amount of damage.  Slide down
the  hill  and  grab the bottom edge.  Let go and grab again to grip the
crevice  just  below  and  shimmy to the ledge on your right.  Enter the
lava  room  on the right and jump to the ledge on the left.  Now begin a
series  of tricky (and deadly) jumps from pillar to pillar until you can
jump into the tunnel on the right wall.

Go  forward  and  push  the  block quickly to avoid the boulder rumbling
towards you.  Once that's over you can pull the block back and get on it
to  access  SECRET  #2 - Uzi clips and a medkit.  Run down the tunnel in
the  corner  and  drop to some more tracks.  Take the medkit and the Uzi
clips  and  grab  the  Shotgun (if you really think you'll need it).  Go
back to the previous room and drop down the hole behind the boulder then
leap  to  the  pillar in the lava tunnel.  Turn right and do a series of
jumps  across three pillars then drop and enter the tunnel below.  Slide
to  the  bottom of the slope then jump to the ledge.  Climb up and enter
the  room  with the TNT.  Fine the one that's not like the others.  Pull
it  into  the  next room - out once - right once - then 3 pulls into the
next  room.   Now  jump (or climb) over it and push it 3 times until you
can get on it and jump into the tunnel.

Go  to the top and climb to the ledge then do a leap to the ledge on the
right.   Wait  for the tunnel to spit out another boulder then leap into
it and follow it to the switch.  Get the magnum clips and use the switch
to  create  a  cave-in in the TNT room.  Now return to the room with the
TNT  box.   Go  to the new hole on the left and enter the passage.  This
next  room has your Uzi's but once again - they are being used for EVIL.
Some  punk-ass  kid  on a skateboard is taking cheap shots at you.  He's
fast but he doesn't attack often so waste him with your magnums and take
back your Uzi's.  You should now have ALL your weapons back!!  Scattered
about this room are 3 Uzi clips so retrieve them then start checking out
the holes

One  of  the  holes has water instead of lava.  Dive in and swim through
the gate to get SECRET #3 - variety of medkits and Uzi clips.  Make your
way back to the skateboard park then go all the way up the hill.  Follow
the  tunnel  into  the  next  room  and start up the slope.  Of course 3
boulders  make  this  harder than it needed to be.  Each boulder has its
own  section  of  the  slope  so stay in the middle.  When the first one
comes  at  ya jump left.  When #2 starts rolling jump right then back to
the middle when #3 starts to roll.  Stop at the top and wait for a forth
boulder to spit out the door.

Enter  the  passage  and  go up the slope and climb up to the next room.
Get on the low pillar and jump to the higher one then jump to the ledge.
Do  another  jump  to  the left then another jump to the left then climb
into  the  room  on  the right.  Push the block twice and enter the next
room  then push the block twice and drop down into the lower room.  Pull
the  block then go back up and drop down on the other side of the block.
Push  it  forward to reveal a switch.  Use it to open a yet unseen door.
Turn  left  at  the switch and enter the alcove straight ahead.  Go left
and  climb  then  move forward to the block and enter the passage at the
left.   Push  the  block at the bottom of the stairs once then turn left
and make a mad dash for the door which closes before you get there!

Use  the  switch next to the door then head back upstairs, past the gold
door  and  drop  through the hole.  Run through the doors and ready your
favorite  weapon  for  another shootout.  He's packing a shotgun so keep
your  distance.   I  recommend magnums at 30 paces and dance like crazy!
When  he's  just  a red spot on the floor relieve him of his shotgun and
then proceed to climb to the ledge above the door into the pyramid.

Jump from ledge to ledge all the way up this sucker.  At the top jump to
the left wall and slide down the pyramid and find the tunnel.  Enter and
use  the  switch to open the door then exit and slide to the bottom.  Go
back to the maze and enter the Gold Door to get a medkit and the keys to
the Pyramid.  Now go to the Pyramid and use the Pyarmid key to enter the
pyramid and EXIT this level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 14 Atlantis - Items: 43 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 26

Wait  for  the lights to come on then advance into this room.  A monster
explodes from a sphere so kill it with your magnums then go to the right
and kill the monster in the second sphere.  Follow the trench and kill a
third  creature  that  blasts from a sphere and get the Uzi ammo.  Enter
the  door  to the left of the center door and enter a room with a webbed
floor.

Get the medkit from the corner then cross the center bridge to the left.
Get  the  shotgun  shells  and  prepare  to  kill  a demon that was just
released.   Kill  him  from  up  here  if  possible.   If you drop a dog
explodes  from  a sphere and just adds to the confusion.  Use the switch
in  the  far right corner of the webbed room then turn around and run to
another  switch  in the opposite wall and use it.  Run back to the other
side and go through the door and down the stairs and trip another switch
to open that center door back at the entrance room.

Return to the center door killing any leftover creatures running around.
Enter  and  kill  the  flying monster while staying in the safety of the
tunnel.   Exit  to  the  ledge  and reverse and drop off and down to the
block  below  grabbing  onto it.  Climb up and get SECRET #1 - clips for
the Uzi and magnum and a medkit.  Go through the tunnel and climb up the
ledge  and drop down the hole.  Turn and go down the passage to a webbed
ledge  then  turn  and  jump  and  grab  the crevice at its lowest part.
Shimmy  and  drop to the tunnel below grabbing the entrance and climb up
into  it.  Flip the switch in this tunnel and get the Uzi ammo then jump
to the webbed ledge.

Leap  from  the  end  of  this ledge to the next and grab on as a sphere
blows  up  below  you.  Climb up to the tunnel.  Leap to the pillar then
leap  to  the darker ledge to the left on the pyramid.  Jump to the next
ledge  avoiding  the  rumbling  boulder coming at you.  Jump to the next
ledge  on your right...just missed it!  After your slide is over you can
now  climb  the  next  set of ledges all the way to the top right corner
using a series of standing jumps.

Enter  the  tunnel  and  get  SECRET  #2  - clips for Uzi and Magnum and
medkit.   Exit and slide down to the red door and turn right and jump to
the  ledge  and grab and climb up.  Jump to the second ledge and get the
medkit  then  jump  to  the next ledge and pull yourself up and into the
tunnel.   Load  up  on  Uzi clips and use the switch then go back to the
water and dive in.

Find  and  use  the switch underwater to open the red door then exit the
water  by  climbing  onto  the small ledge on the left side of the slope
then  climb  to  the  pillar and jump back to the pyramid.  Retrace your
path  back  to the red door and get inside before it shuts.  Jump to the
ledge and go up some stairs jumping into the door.  Climb up the passage
saving  your game and jumping some spikes on the way.  Dive in the water
and go down into the underwater chamber and get some shells then use the
switch  and  swim  through the door and back up to the surface.  Get the
Uzi  clips after you dash through the veg-o-matic then go right and leap
to the next ledge.

Ignore  those  clips for now as a demon is ready to pounce.  Dart inside
the  tunnel and kill him from a safer place then get the Uzi clips after
he  is  dead.  Turn back and dive into the water at the other end of the
tunnel.  Swim between the two spheres and climb to the ledge and use the
switch  in  the  right  corner  to open a door.  Now go left and use the
switch around the corner to open another door.

As you near the sphere in the right corner a monster explodes from it so
kill  it then go use the switch in the remaining corner to open the last
underwater  door.   Dive  in and go through the long corridor with the 3
open  doors.   Exit  into a dark tunnel and go up the ramp on your left.
Turn  right  at the red passage and flip the switch to open the door and
get the Uzi ammo.

Find  the  block  across  from  the boulder and pull it out then push it
against  the  left  wall.  Return to the red door and switch and use the
switch  again  and enter the door.  Your strategically placed block stop
the  boulder and you can now enter the tunnel it was blocking.  Kill the
demon  as  you  walk  onto  the ledge then jump to the right ledge.  The
tunnel  leads to a room with with 2 demons in spheres.  Release only one
at a time and back into the tunnel to kill them from safety.  Go back to
where there were demons a minute ago.

Now  slide  down the slope and jump as you near the bottom.  Try to land
on a red ledge as anything else will dump you into some spikes.  Get the
shells  and  the  medkit  and all that Uzi ammo then enter the next room
through  the  tunnel.   Go  right and go to the ledge to wake up another
demon  then  run back to the tunnel to kill it.  Now go back and jump to
the  left  ledge  and then jump to the small ledge after that.  Get into
the tunnel on the right quickly to attack another demon.  You can now go
back out and jump to the glowing yellow slop in the center of this room.

Leap  to  the rock ledge then get the Uzi clips and use the switch up on
the slope.  Turn and go until the ledge tilts.  Jump over it and pull on
the  block  to  open  a tunnel.  Run past the veg-o-matic and kill the 2
demons  on the other side.  Jump over to the dead demons and head up the
tunnel  and  climb some stairs to get Uzi clips and a medkit.  Go to the
ledge  on  the  right and kill the monster flying around in here then go
left and jump to the ledge on the left.  Enter the tunnel.

Leap  to  the  ledge  in the corner and enter another tunnel and use the
switch before going back to the lava room.  Jump over to the first ledge
then  jump  to the pillar on the left.  Do another jump to the next left
pillar  and  then  a  flying  leap  into the door.  Climb up and use the
switch  at  the end of the passage.  Return to the ledge and do a series
of  jumps  to  cross  the  pillars and reach the tunnel.  Proceed up the
passage  and  go  into the corner of the room to activate a secret door.
Run  up the hill on the left with Uzi's blazing and kill the 3 attacking
creatures.

Enter  the  alcove  on  the right for SECRET #3 - shells, medkit and Uzi
clips.   Go  back  to the main passage and turn right to go into the red
tunnel.   After  the door shuts climb to the passage above and go to the
end and jump to the ledge on the right.  Grab the Uzi ammo and enter the
passage.   Kill  the  alien that suddenly appears then get more Uzi ammo
and continue on to the ramp that leads up to the veg-o-matic.

Run  up  the  ramp  and  stop  just before it.  A boulder begins to roll
towards  you  so jump left then continue when all is safe.  Now push the
block on your left 2 times and go down the tunnel on the right to find 2
switches.   Use the right switch and jump back quickly to avoid the trap
door.  Do a safety drop through the trap door then move forward to start
another  boulder rolling then jump back and over the hole.  Move forward
again  and go up the tunnel and climb the ledge on the left to reach the
switch.   Use  it then, then make your way back to the 2 switches and go
through  the  now  open door.  Kill the alien in the passage and use the
switch  in  the  corner to open a door.  Get some Uzi ammo in two of the
corners.

Enter  the  door and then slide into the next room.  Kill the 2 monsters
at  the  bottom but DO NOT attack the next creature that appears.  IT IS
YOU!  Anything you do - it does.

Climb  the  ledge to the right and jump to the stone pillar then leap to
the  ledge  by  the door and use the switch to open the trap door.  Turn
and  jump to the sandy ledge then climb and jump to the sandy pillar and
finally  leap to the sandy ledge.  Go to the middle of the ledge quickly
and  your double will fall into the pit.  If the door shuts you were too
slow and you have to try again.

Go  back  to  the rocky ledge with the pit and get some Uzi ammo then go
up.   Kill  the  Centaur  and  load up on more Uzi ammo and kill another
alien.   Go right at the end of the tunnel to find a switch that opens a
door.   Run  along the left ledge and use the next switch.  You are on a
TIME  LIMIT  so ignore the clips and run back to the entrance and across
the bridge.

Grab  the Uzi clips lying here then approach the alien device and USE it
to EXIT this level and start a cool movie

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 15 The Great Pyramid - Items: 30 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 3

This is it!!  The FINAL LEVEL!!  And it starts with the hardest enemy in
this game - one big ALIEN!  After a couple hundred rounds of Uzi fire or
20-30  well  placed  shotgun  blasts  he  will  die.   There are several
strategies  for  killing this guy - I'll let you find yours.  Just DON'T
FALL IN THE PIT or you may as well load that last save game.

Find and pick-up all 6 Uzi clips from the corners of the room below then
enter  and slide down the red tunnel.  Push the block 3 times then go up
the  ramp  and  push the next block once then climb to the tunnel above.
Now  dash through the veg-o-matic and don't fall through the fake floor.
Go  right  at  the  intersection  until you reach a block which you push
forward.   Return to the intersection and turn right going past the door
and  drop into a room with a block.  Pull the block then climb up to the
tunnel and go left and back down and push the block forward then go back
to the red door.

Get  on  the  block and use the switch then turn and enter the next room
and go right and jump to the ledge on the slope.  Jump to the next ledge
and  a  third  jump  to  the  long ledge that cross the entire slope.  A
bridge  appears  behind  your  so jump back and cross the bridge to find
SECRET  #1 - medkit, shells, and magnum clips.  Use the switch 2 times -
down  then  back up to secure a portion of the bridge then return to the
ledges and go left to the tunnel entrance.

Proceed  up the tunnel and reverse when the boulder comes at you.  Avoid
the  boulder  then  go  back  up the tunnel to repeat this with a second
boulder.  At the end of the tunnel is a collapsible ledge which you need
to  roll  onto  then run off before you fall.  Hang and drop down taking
severe damage then recharge your health.

Shoot  the  Scion  until it explodes starting a major earthquake for the
rest  of  the  game.  Go through the door and kill the 3 monsters in the
room then drop down to the rocks below on the right of the bridge.  Do a
safety drop through the hole by the wall then turn and leap and grab the
crevice.   Shimmy  to the right ignoring the darts which only do minimal
damage.   At  the far right drop and slide backwards toward the lava but
jump backwards before you fall in.

Enter  the  next  room and go to the right side of the hill and continue
down  to  trigger  a  boulder.  It will roll by and fall into the crack.
Now  go  to the swinging blade and do a timed jump across to some spikes
that  you  need to WALK through.  The next bridge is made of collapsible
panels  so  you  need  to  cross it in a double jump with the first jump
putting you in the center of the bridge and the second in the doorway.

On the left wall is a crevice you can jump to.  Grab on and shimmy right
until  you  can  drop  to  the ledge and get SECRET #2 - medkits and Uzi
clips.   Jump  backwards  off this ledge to the slanted pillar then jump
forward  to  the next pillar.  Jump into the tunnel on the right and run
through  it  as the floor falls away behind you.  Time your jump through
the  cleaver  then go right down the slope and try to outrun the boulder
chasing  you.   When  the chase is over you can jump over the boulder to
get a medkit then jump back and turn right to slide down a second slope.
Time  your  jump  past  the  blade  to get to the ledge then drop to the
tunnel and run past the lava that enters the tunnel.

Get the medkit and continue past more lava then use the switch and enter
the  door.   Get the Uzi clips in the passage to your right then go back
to the lava hole.  A boulder rolls above you so when it passes jump over
the  hole  and hang as a second boulder rolls by overhead.  Climb up and
enter  the  next room with a series of ledges with flames on them.  Stay
close  to  the  wall and make the jumps.  You will take some heat damage
but  not  nearly  as much as if you catch on fire.  If you do burst into
flames  drop  down to the water below to put out the fire then swim back
to the beginning and try again.

You  should  now  be  in  a room with a pool and a cleaver.  Jump to the
panel  in  front  of  the  blade  which falls out from under you so pull
yourself  up  and leap into the cave entrance through the swing blade to
find  SECRET #3 - Uzi ammo and a medkit.  When you are ready to leave to
to  the edge of the entrance - take one step back then jump to that tiny
pool  below.   Grab  the Uzi clips then swim through the tunnel and into
the  next  room.   Now  get  some more Uzi ammo and proceed to the large
room.

Natla is back and is flying around shooting fireballs at you!  Blast her
with Uzi fire and dodge as much as you can.  Heal yourself often.  After
shoot  her down she will get up and you must continue to blast her until
she  STAYS  down.  Enter the tunnel and get some Uzi ammo.  Note:  Natla
was  the  last  enemy  in  this  game  so  any more ammo is strictly for
obtaining a PERFECT ITEM score.

Head  up  the ramp in the corner and jump into the passage that leads to
some  pillars.   Jump to the nearest then turn and jump to the pillar on
the  left.   Jump to the pillar below the door then climb up to the top.
Turn  and drop through the hole landing on the pillar then turn and jump
across  the  next 2 pillars.  Jump to the pillar below the door and grab
on  and  climb  into the tunnel.  Run down the hall and do a safety drop
from the hole onto another pillar.

Turn  right  and  leap to the ledge below the tunnel then climb into the
tunnel and run forward.  Slide down the long slope to EXIT the level and
the game.

CONGRATULATIONS!!!  You just finished TOMB RAIDER!

Enjoy  the  closing  movie  and don't forget...  You can now go back and
replay  any  level with all weapons and infinite ammo.  Mr.  T-Rex falls
much quicker under UZI FIRE!!!  Have Fun!!
