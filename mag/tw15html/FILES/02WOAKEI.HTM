 After  several emails about the upcoming WOA show from Amida I took the
hint  and decided to come down to London for a short visit and to take a
gander  at the WOA while I was there.  I justified the cost to myself in
the  hope  that  it  would  shed  some  light on the future of the Amiga
because  with  all  this talk of it dying and every scener considering a
move to the PC, I needed cheering up.
 As  it happened, Middlesbrough would be playing at Wembley that weekend
and  the  National  Express  coach was full of Boro supporters.  I got a
back  seat  so I had enough leg room and enough space to rest the laptop
on  my  knee.   I  ended  up having a family of 3 sitting next to me who
insisted  on  talking  about  football all the way there.  I had had the
foresight  to bring a copy of FHM with me so I delved into that, usually
I  just  read Kenco's copy as it is a hell of a lot cheaper!  The bugger
won't let me keep the pull-outs though.  ;)
 I looked out of the window occasionally but the only things that caught
my  eye was an over-turned lorry and pretty polly covered legs every 5th
car. ;)
 On  arrival  to  London I finally got to see Buckingham Palace, did the
tourist  thing  with  the  camera  (as  you  do) then went for a walk to
downing  street,  Westminster  then  back  to Amida's via the tube.  Not
being  from  London  I  kinda  like  the tube but I guess I haven't seen
whatever it is everyone moans about yet.
 The  next  day  we  set  off  for Hammersmith.  Upon exiting the London
Underground  we  encountered  a  guy carring a carrier bag full of Amiga
boxed  software.   On  a hunch, I asked him if he knew where the WOA was
and  he  gave us directions which we later ignored when we realised that
it wasn't being held in a multistory car park.
 We  found  the  hotel where the show was being held and Amida noticed a
bus load of oriental ladies exiting a bus so trailing behind we followed
them  in,  up several levels of escalators untill we came to a reception
area  that was way to posh for us students.  After asking for directions
we  started  to  head back down out of the hotel and into an entranceway
further down the side.
 The  entrance  led  to  a few tables where people were checking/selling
tickets.   the  place looked small as you looked into it but as I had no
idea what to expect anyway, we ventured in.
 We  started  looking around first to find out where everything was.  It
was layed out like white market stalls with a small bar and seating area
to the left of the entrance.  After wondering around and checking things
out  we  decided  to  got  talk  to  people to get some of our questions
answered.   We  had also brought the Word with us so we can distribute a
few copies.  We had finished it the night before and we normally require
a  week  between  finishing  it  and  releasing it so it gets out to our
distributors asap.  However, for that issue there was a pre-release date
(PRD)  and  the  official  release  date  (ORD) as listed in the loading
ascii.

 I can't exactly remember the order we went in to see the exhibitors but
here's what I can remember.

 We  had  to  wait a while to get someones attention.  They seemed to be
concentrating on promoting their special WOA subscription offers of free
CD's.   I  guess  with  the Amiga's future unsure, magazines are worried
about  their  readership  and money.  We did finally get to speak to one
guy but his interest in PD software wasn't too great but he had heard of
The  Word  so I guess we can't complain!  I have to admit that I haven't
bought  Amiga  format  in a while because I'm a net junkie and I can get
the info, news and software a lot faster than they can.  However the guy
was ok and he gave me his email id so I could mail him The Word.

 This  was  one  of  the  best  stands  for  computers.   Micronik  were
exhibiting  some neat hardware and I had a play on the Infinitiv towers.
They had these cool keyboards with those laptop type mice built-in where
you  move  your  finger  around  a  square  to move the mouse pointer on
screen.   There were 4 computers laid out with a monitor and keyboard in
the middle.  It was a circular table so if you were facing a monitor and
keyboard there would be two towers either side.  I was playing with a CD
eject/close  program  but it didn't seem to work.  I looked at the tower
but nothing happened!  Amida then tapped me on the shoulder to inform me
that  I was looking at the wrong computer!  The one on the right where a
german  guy  from  Amiga  Tech  was  demonstating  another  machine to a
customer,  was just opening and closing the CDROM drive!  He didn't look
to happy so we quickly walked away. ;)
 Micronik  also  had  the  prototype  genlock on display where you could
watch  TV/satellite  on  your  Workbench backdrop while you worked away.
Well  smart!   Amida  noticed  a guy giving a mouse mat to a woman so he
went  up and asked if they were free which they were.  I got one as well
then  we  sorta went around to find anyone else giving them away.  Amida
got  another two and I ran into a guy who gave me another and a mouse as
well.   Of  course Amida couldn't be out done so he had to go get one as
well.   They  were  those  black Amiga technology 2-button mice with the
Amiga logo on them and the mouse mats were those white and red ones with
"AM" on them.  About 13quids worth of gear for nothing..  not bad.
 From  then  on  Amida went around everywhere saying "is this free?" and
about  2  seconds  after the guy had managed to say "No.  Would you like
to..."  he was talking to thin air.  Amida was by then at the next stand
asking  the same question.  If the answer was yes however, the guy would
have a few less of the items than he started with.  Amida was carrying a
big bag at the end of the day.

 At  University  I  was  introduced to UNIX and I took it upon myself to
familiarise myself with it completly.  It's a great operating system and
I  have a copy of Red Hat Linux for my PC but Linux for the Amiga caught
my  eye  at the end of the Blittersoft stand.  It was running on a A3000
with  128mbs  of RAM and a very large hard drive.  The guy said it would
work  with  6mbs  so  I  guess I'll be on the look out for this piece of
software to add to my collection.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>CU AMIGA</CENTER></FONT></B>


 I  haven't  read  CU  Amiga lately either.  Actually rephrase that to I
haven't  bought  a copy lately as I do tend to go into W.H.Smith's a lot
and  read  it  there.  My primary interest was in getting them to review
The Word because since NFA stopped producing it, people tend to think it
isn't  around  anymore and I wanted them to see that it was.  I spoke to
Mat  B?   but  he  seemed more interested in getting his Mac emulator to
work  than  in talking to anyone.  I got him to take a copy anyway and I
checked  out  TFX  which  they  had  on  an  overhead  TV.  I wasn't too
impressed  with  it  to be honest but then I haven't played flight simms
since  F18  Interceptor  on  my  A500  some  years ago.  They just don't
compare to DESCENT on the PC. ;)

 They had Cloanto's Personal Paint v7.1 on display and I figured I'd ask
about  it.   The  salesman knew virtually nothing about it.  My question
was  if  Cloanto  had  payed  the license fee to save GIFs using the LZW
compression  algorithm as my v6.x loads GIFs but will not save them.  He
went on to gave me loads of info on GIF formats and PNG to show off what
he  knows about it , so I got really technical with my questions so he'd
um  and  ah  then go ask his mate.  He also tried to sell us a mouse mat
for a quid that was as thin as a McDonalds burger.

 Me and Amida got talking to the guy that seemed to be in charge at this
stand.   We  chatted  about  graphic  adventure  games (the only games I
really  love  to  play)  and  games for the Amiga in general.  He seemed
interested  in  promoting game development on the Amiga and as Amida was
coding  a  game  at present, details were swapped.  I had played all the
graphic  adventure  games  I  could  see  on  display  so I asked him to
recommend  another  I hadn't heard of .  He recommended Speris Legacy so
I'll  let  you know if it was any good.  (We should have some more games
reviews in The Word, come on guys!)

Note:   At the time he said that Vulcan Software Ltd would not be making
anymore of their "Valhalla" series of games after the 3rd one but if you
check elsewhere in this issue you will see that isn't true!

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>EPIC</CENTER></FONT></B>


 Epic  took  the piss out of the PC on their stand.  They had a PC tower
tilted  at  an  angle  with fake burn marks on it's sides and the RESET,
TURBO  and  HD  lights  doing  traffic  light simulations with the speed
indicator  saying  "PC".   The  point was you had to write your name and
address  on  a piece of paper with whatever you thought PC stood for and
you  posted  it  through  the  empty  5.25 drive bay.  I wrote "Probably
Compatible"  and  I  got  mail from Epic later (advertising their goods)
with  the  reply  that  I  was  unsuccessful  and the winner was "Public
Convienence".   They  did however have these cool warning signs for your
bedroom/office  doors which were for AREA 51 and said "Tresspassers will
be abducted!".

 I  spent  some  time at this stand talking to the guy about the Siamese
System he was demonstrating.  Amida told me it was a PC and Amiga in one
so  I just had to look.  It turned out to be a PC and an Amiga connected
via  serial  ports  and  a hardware device.  This device interpreted the
signals  coming from each machine so it could send signals to the other.
Sort  of  an  interpreter  buffering device.  It wasn't that far from my
Amiga  to PC via parallel cable connection I have at home except it does
slightly more than just copy files.  I wasn't that impressed because you
still  need  a  PC  and  an Amiga (or at least the PC card) to get it to
work.   If  they  ever  get  both  architectures in one box then I'll be
impressed and not as two separate linked machines.

I  went  to  this  stand  to  check out The Big Red Adventure because it
looked  like the sort of game I'll miss Xena:  Warrior Princess for (I'd
still  tape it!).  Amida started talking to someone about something when
I  realised  he  was talking to David Pleasance ex-Chairman of Commodore
UK.   I  nudged  him  and told him so to which he asked the guy "Are you
that  guy that ran Commodore?".  Luckily David found this funny.  I took
this opportunity to ask him about the Amiga and how he sees it's future.
He told me that the Amiga was ahead of the rest in it's time but because
no  new  architecture  has been created for several years, it has become
old  technology.   He  went on to tell me about the hardware that he had
seen being developed for the Amiga which would make the PC look like the
office  toy that it is but they all got scrapped.  He said there is only
so  much that can be done with the existing technology and if Gateway do
not  bring  out  some  new  Amiga's  he  can't see them lasting for much
longer.   He  had brought along a piece of nostalgia as well in the form
of  the  1  millionth  Amiga  off  the  production  line  complete  with
certificate of authenticity.  The Amiga was a gold coloured A500.

Sadeness  brougt out NFA's AGA Experience some time ago so I figured I'd
chat  to  these  guys about the possibility of supporting Carnage.  They
liked the idea and I have their email id to contact them with the latest
Carnage  releases  and info.  My exams finished yesterday so they should
be hearing from me pretty soon!

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>17-BIT PD</CENTER></FONT></B>


This  was  at the Weird Science stand and consisted of one young guy who
said  he had bought out 17-Bit.  I didn't believe it at first but I gave
him a copy of The Word.  Are large PD companies selling out as well?


 Those  are  the  stands  I  recall off the top of my head.  The overall
feeling  of  the  place was that the Amiga's near future seemed safe.  I
was  well  impressed with the 603e at the Phase 5 stand.  The guy loaded
up  a rendered MPEG which he played at full speed as a backdrop while he
rendered  in  the  foreground  as  well  as  doing other tasks.  He then
clicked  on  a  workbench window and dragged it across the screen...  it
was  extremely  smooth  with no refreshing that I could see!  I want one
now!
 Also  met  the  creator  of  Worms.   Ended  up  with a signed "Keep On
Worming"  poster of WORMS DC from him.  It was a pair of a french ladies
breasts  with a superimposed tattoo of WORMS DC on it.  He tried to give
away  the  english  version  saying "We can't give awawy english breasts
these  days!".  In case you are reading this Andy, I'm the one who ended
up  with  it after saing "I'll take any breasts I can get my hands on!".
;)
 Half  way  through  the  day  I got so nackered I paid the extortionate
price  for  a coke which was 90% ice, and got my monies worth by sucking
the ice.  It was so hot!  ;)
 After  walking  around  once  more  to make sure we had seen everything
there  was  to  see  and to make sure that Amida had not missed anything
else that was free or not nailed down, we set off for the tube station.
