Level 9 Tomb of Tihocan - Items: 26 - Secrets: 2 - Kills: 16

SPLASH!!   Swim  down  the  passage until you reach tunnels going up and
down.   Go down and through the tunnel until you reach the switch.  This
lowers  the  water  so  you  can now go to the other tunnel and exit the
water.   Use the switch here to open the door down the hall.  Go through
the  door  and  shoot the croc then climb the stairs.  Go up and over to
the  furthest step then jump across to the ledge next to you.  Climb the
ledge to your left then run to the corner to avoid the darts shooting at
you.

Do  a  running  leap to the ledge in the opposite corner then climb into
the  alcove and use the switch to flood the room.  Take a swim and go to
the  new tunnel which used to be covered by the now-floating white block
and  get  the  medkit.   Swim up and climb onto the white block then run
into  the tunnel and take another swim.  Go down and forward and use the
switch  to  activate a strong current.  Go up for air and swim forward -
the  current will sweep you away allowing you to travel further than you
ever could by just swimming.  Exit the water when you reach the end then
climb  out, shoot the rat then pull the block out of the wall toward the
water.

Get  on  the block and jump up to the ledge then turn around and jump to
the  wide  ledge then jump into the darkness to your right.  Climb up to
your  right  then  turn  right and climb some more.  From the top of the
pillar  jump to the ledge.  Mr.  Sniper will be shooting at you again so
fire at him until he flees then walk to the swinging axe and jump behind
it.   Get  the shells then jump back to end up back ontop of the pillar.
Face the door and jump up to it

Enter  the  tunnel  and have a short gunfight with the sniper guy again.
Go down the hall and jump/run through the veg-o-matic until you get to a
pit  with  a  big  croc at the bottom.  Kill him from the safety of your
perch  then  drop  down  when  its safe.  Go down the stairs and get the
shells  and  the  magnum  clips.   Using  your 3D Look-around find the 3
concealed  floor  panels  and  step  on each of them to open the door to
SECRET  #1.   Enter  and  turn to face the door.  Jump left and hold the
button to make multiple leaps to shells and a medkit.

Exit  back  to the stairs and jump back out to the pillar.  Jump back to
the ledge with the swing axe and do a jump to the door behind the blade.
Run  down  the  stairs  and either roll or jump backwards off the end to
hang  on the edge.  Shimmy to the right and climb up into a tunnel where
you  can use the switch to flood the room.  Dive in and swim to the step
along  the  wall.  Kill the giant rat then dive in the water behind him.
Swim to the next room and exit the water shooting the cougar.  Enter the
tunnel and use the switch to open the gate.

Kill  the 2 gorillas lurking above.  If you can't see them then jump and
fire at the peak of your jump.  Jump and pull yourself up after they are
both  dead.   Jump to the crevice on your left and grab on and shimmy to
the  right and climb up to the gate.  Enter and get the Gold Key and the
medkit  then  go  back to the dead cougar.  Enter the tunnel and use the
Gold  Key.   This  causes  several blocks to float to the surface.  Do a
series of jumps to cross these blocks and get the medkit before entering
the door.

Enter  the  room  on the left with the writing on the floor and pull the
block  out  of  the  wall and place it on the writing.  Kill the gorilla
that  appears  from behind the block then get the shells and magnum clip
he  was  guarding.   Go back and pull the block until its on the writing
next  to  the  door.  Shoot the gorilla that comes out of a newly opened
door  then  go  get  the shotgun shells.  Go back and climb ontop of the
block  and  jump to the door above.  Run through the veg-o-matic and get
the  medkit  and Rusty Key then return to the main room.  Push the block
away  from  the  ledge  then circle around and pull it onto the writing.
Rats  attack  so  climb/jump  onto the block and shoot them from safety.
Enter  the  new  room and get the medkit then go back and push the block
onto the final writing tile.  Go to the door and IGNORE the medkit - its
a  trap.  Run straight through and climb and get the Rusty Key.  Get the
medkit on your way back out.

Go  back  to the main room with the door with locks on each side and use
your  Rusty  Keys.   Enter and then jump to the right of the ramp.  Do a
series  of  jumps  up  to  a secret passage then jump across a series of
collapsible panels to SECRET #2.  Here is the jump combo that worked for
me:   Turn so Lara's right side is facing the first tile then jump RIGHT
- FORWARD - RIGHT - RIGHT - RIGHT - BACK - RIGHT ending up in the secret
room.  Get the uzi and magnum clips then return to the ramp.

Slide down and into the water and swim through the tunnel exiting onto a
ledge  where  you  can shoot a croc.  Enter the tunnel and climb all the
ledges to reach the top then slide down to the ledge in the sand.  Slide
down  the  ramp on your right and jump to the ledge then climb up to the
switch and open the underwater gate.

Take  a dive and swim into the next room and exit before a large temple.
Swim  under the temple and find the hidden tunnel in the rear.  You will
surface inside where you can use the switch to open the main door.  Swim
back outside and exit to the left of the temple on the sand.  LOOK OUT!!

A  statue  comes  to  life  and  starts throwing fireballs at you.  Jump
around  and dodge his attacks while pumping lead into him until he dies.
Enter  the  temple.  Its finally time to take care of your sniper friend
(his  name  is  Pierre) so ready your magnums and take care of business!
When  he hits the floor remove the magnums, Gold Key and the Scion piece
from  him.   Climb  to the ledge above and get the medkit and the magnum
clips.  Use the Gold Key to open the door below and you are free to EXIT
this level.  You can wander back outside and take on the other statue if
you are feeling daring today!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 10 City of Khamoon - Items: 24 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 14

We  start  a new chapter and a new level by jumping into a pit.  Use the
block along the right as a step.  Turn left and enter the tunnel and use
the  switch  to open the door in the previous room.  Enter this door and
pull  the block 3 times then enter the passage behind it to get a medkit
and  magnum  clips.   Go  back and climb up on the block then behind the
second  block.   Pull  the block once then go to the side and pull it as
far as you can then go to the opposite side and push it into the wall.

Go  to  the block in the corner and jump to the crevice and shimmy right
until  you  can  climb  into the cave.  Shoot the panther (finally a new
enemy) from the entrance then enter and turn left and climb the ledge to
the medkit and magnum clips.  Back at the floor slide down to the Sphinx
and  kill  the  panther-mummy  creature  then jump into the water on the
right and get the magnum clips on the bottom.  You should be able to use
your  Magnums  for  the  rest of the game if you've been getting all the
clips up to this point.

Exit  the  water between the palm trees and climb to the ledge above and
go  about halfway across and jump to the pillar to your left and get the
shotgun  shells.   Dive  into  the  pool and exit on the left paw of the
sphinx.  Climb to the chin and go around to the left where you will find
a tunnel with shells and a Sapphire Key.

Go  to the block between the sphinx's legs and pull it out until you can
enter  the  tunnel  behind it where you can use the Sapphire Key to open
the  door.   Go down the passage to the next room and go right and up to
the ledge with the medkit.  Jump forward to the next ledge and shoot the
panther  below  then  jump to the ledge along the far wall.  Go down the
right  passage  and kill the panther as he charges at you.  You may have
to  jump  back  or  just  use  the  Shotgun for immediate gratification.
Follow  the  passage underneath the bridge.  Keep on going and shoot the
croc then hang and drop off the ledge by the phoenix.  Drop down and get
the  medkit  then  enter  the  room  and  trigger  another Indiana Jones
Boulder.   Avoid  it  then go to where it stops and turn right and go up
the hill to a dark passage.  Climb the ledges and jump into the room for
SECRET #1 - magnum clips and a medkit.

Take a swim in the corner and flip the switch below to open the door and
continue forward and up out of the water before the croc eats you.  Kill
him from the safety of the ledge then go to the ledge below the gate and
climb up.  Push the block fowards 2 times then get on it and jump to the
ledge  below  the  door.  Pull yourself up and go up the steps.  Jump up
into  the  tunnel and use the wall switch to extend a gold bridge in the
previous room.

Return to the room and jump back to the block and push the block back to
its  original position then pull it once toward the water then go to the
other  side  and push it once.  Go stand on the block and jump across to
the  ledge  with the block on it.  Ready your magnums and push the block
to open a hidden door.  Enter and kill the cat-mummy then use the switch
to  open  a  door in the ceiling above the golden bridge.  Return to the
ledge  and  pull  the  block twice so you can jump to the golden bridge.
Now jump up and climb into the door in the ceiling and use the switch up
there to open the door by the cat statue.

Head  for  the  silver  gong and jump to the left ledge.  Turn right and
jump  to  the  rock  ledge  and  go to the end to get some magnum clips.
Slide down the slope to the left and get the medkit then jump to the paw
on  your  right.   From the paw jump to the green ledge on your left and
get  the  magnum clips.  Get on the slope then jump to a ledge above the
ramp  to  get SECRET #2 - Uzi clips.  Shoot the croc below then hang and
drop to the ramp below and go to the cat statue.

Do  a  safety  drop  to  the  green ledge and then another to the floor.
Enter  the  door (without stairs) and get the magnum clips then turn and
drop  down  the hole.  Shoot the barely visible panthers in the darkness
below.   Walk  around  and get the magnum clips in the corners but don't
use  the  light switch yet!  Drop to the darkness below and shoot 2 more
panthers then head for the lit passage and get the medkit.

Go to the back of the room and look up at the ledge just to the right of
the bridge.  Its very hard to see in the dark but it is there.  Climb up
to it then turn and jump to the left onto the bridge.  Cross over to the
middle  ledge  and go to the left and shoot the panthers below.  Jump to
the alcove in the corner to get SECRET #3 - shotgun shells.

Jump  back  on the bridge and make your way back down to the floor.  Get
the  medkit in the other lighted tunnel then climb back up to the bridge
and enter the lighted passage next to it.  At the end of the tunnel is a
cat-mummy  so keep those magnums ready.  Enter the next room and jump to
the  tunnel on your right and follow to the next room.  Climb the pillar
and  take  the Sapphire Key from the top.  Proceed up the hill and enter
the door then do 3 jumps across some ledges and get the magnum clips.

Jump  to  the ledge on your left then climb up to the switch and use it.
Make  your way back to the entrance and do a safety drop to a long slope
below.   You'll slide down for quite a distance then you can walk up the
slope  on the right to a room with a lock where you can use the Sapphire
Key to open the final door and EXIT this level.

Level 11 Obelisk of Khamoon - Items: 24 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 14

This  level  begins with a door followed by an uphill climb on the right
and then a tunnel on the left you can climb into.  The tunnel leads to a
room  with  4 pillars - each with a block.  Go to the pillar next to the
Gold  Door  on the right and pull the block 3 times then push it beneath
the  door.  Enter the newly revealed tunnel and take care of the panther
before getting the medkit at the end of this passage.

Return  to  the pillars and go to the left one and push the block to the
left  to permit access to the alcove and water beyond.  Swim through the
tunnels  making sure to get out and kill the croc.  Along the bottom you
will find a medkit and magnum clips and a Sapphire Key is stashed in one
of  the  corners.   Return  to the pillar room and go to the door in the
corner to the right of elevated door in the wall.

Use  the  Sapphire Key to open the next door then climb up and enter the
Gold  Door.   Proceed up the stairs and shoot the panther-mummy then use

vision  is over drop off the bridge and get some shells then dive in the
water  and  get the magnum clips.  Surface and enter the tunnel opposite
the Gold Door.

Slide  down the slope and kill the 2 panthers waiting for you then go up
the  stairs and use the top step to jump to the ledge.  Reverse and jump
to  the  corner ledge then reverse and do a jump/grab to the ledge above
the  first.   Go  to  the  edge  and  jump across to the next ledge then
reverse  and  jump back to the longer ledge.  Go to the corner and climb
then  do  a  reverse  and climb some more then jump across to the square
ledge.   Jump  again  to the ledge in the corner.  Turn left and jump to
the  highest  ledge  in  the  room  then  go up the stairs and shoot the
panther-mummy.

Continue  down  the stairs and use the switch by the pillars to access a
new bridge.  Drop down to the left of the switch to get a medkit and two
magnum  clips  then return to the top of the stairs and do a safety drop
into  the  pit on the left.  Surf to the bottom of a very tall room then
run  to  the  alcove  on the right to kill another panther then flip the
switch.

Proceed  to  either door opposite the alcove and get the magnum clips on
your  way  there.  Back at the main room go up the new stairs jumping to
some  shotgun shells on the ledge to your left.  Jump back to the stairs
and  go up a few more until you can drop to a ledge.  Now turn and enter
the  door  then  jump over to the ledge and follow it across a bridge to
the Ankh which displays another watery vision.

Back at the ledge, go past the door and get the medkit at the steps then
use  the  switch before going down.  At the bottom enter the new chamber
to your left and proceed up the stairs.  At the top turn and jump to the
crevice  on  your  right and shimmy to the ledge on your right and drop.
Go  around  and  do  a  safety  drop  to  another  ledge  and  enter the
hyroglyhics chamber and use the switch.  Go back outside and continue up
the stairs which were previously buried under sand.

Kill  the  panther-mummy  at  the  top then use the switch to activate a
third  bridge and finally get the medkit on the ledge.  Turn and use the
other  switch  to  open  a  door  then run through the door and down the
steps.   Walk through some pillars to the ledge then do a flying leap to
the  column  with  a  medkit  and  some Uzi Clips - SECRET #1.  Find the
silver  gong  below  and do another leap to reach it and SECRET #2 - Uzi
Clips and medkit.

Drop  to  the ledge on your right and enter the door with a green ledge.
Climb  the  stairs  and cling to the wall and shimmy right until you can
pull  yourself  up.   Turn and jump to the ledge on your right and enter
the  tunnel  and  get SECRET #3 - magnum clips and medkit.  Drop down to
the  next  ledge  and  continue  into the chamber with 2 mummies waiting
below.

Climb  down  to  the ledge below then do a safety drop to the next ledge
but  don't  fall  -  instead shimmy to your right before dropping to the
next ledge.  Turn and fall back off the ledge and grab on then shimmy to
the  right  and  drop again.  Kill those mummies.  Follow the passage on
your left and use the switch to access the last bridge in this level.

Return  to  the  mummy  room and jump over to the ledge then drop to the
ground  and  go  between  the  2  chairs.   Climb  the ledge and keep on
climbing  unti  you reach the green ledge.  Enter the door and cross the
bridge  to  get  the Scarab.  Hop to the bridge on your left and get the
Seal of Anibus to open an underwater door.  Drop into the water and swim
for the tunnel.  Its a long one so fill your lungs before entering.

Go  to  the bottom and then forward to the second set of alcoves and get
the  magnum clips on the left.  Proceed the next set of alcoves and take
a  medkit and shotgun shells on your right.  Continue down until you can
surface.   Recharge that air meter and then get the medkit, magnum clips
and  shotgun  shells  from the bottom.  Exit the pool and kill the mummy
then get the magnum clips from the ledge.

Climb  the  stairs  in the left corner and follow the passage.  Kill the
mummy from the safety of the large mound then get the medkit on the left
side of the mound.  Jump to and climb the steps on the right side of the
mound.   At  the  top  you  can  drop into the Sphinx room from the last
level.  Go to the palm trees and find the pillar that you can use your 4
new  artifacts  on.   A door opens to the left of the Sphinx and you can
EXIT!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 12 Sanctuary of Scion - Items: 28 - Secrets: 1 - Kills: 15

Start this level by getting some ammo for your magnums (which you should
be  using full time now).  Dash up the stairs and waste the 2 mummies up
top  and load up on magnum ammo.  Jump to the room above then go forward
and  right  and  slide  down the slope and kill the mummy at the bottom.
Hop  up  on  the slanted block next to the lit pillar then climb to your
left and jump backwards onto the pillar above.

With  the  wall  on your left leap to the next pillar then advance until
you  can reach the crevice in the wall.  Grab it and shimmy to the right
and  drop  down.   Go  up the steps to the right and jump across several
pillars  ending  on  a  ledge  with  some more magnum clips.  Do 3 jumps
forward  from  this ledge to end at some stairs.  Go down the stairs and
flip the switch to open a door below.

The  flapping you should be hearing is a demon.  Shoot him as soon as he
is  in  range and do not let up until one of you is dead.  If he reaches
the platform he could knock you off.  Get next to the edge by the switch
and leap forward to a tiny ledge.  Get some shells then jump to the left
grabbing  and pulling yourself up to some more shells.  Jump to the next
ledge  then  jump off and do a safety drop to the ledge below.  Turn and
jump  to the sandy ledge then drop off backwards and slide down grabbing
on  to  the  end  of the slide and dropping safely down.  Get the magnum
clips from between the Sphinx paws then find the 2 slanted spires in the
corner.

Climb  on  the  right block then jump to the left then jump to the ledge
and one more jump to the pillar and pull yourself up.  Now turn left and
jump  to the next pillar and another jump to a curving ledge above.  Run
past  the veg-o-matic to your right and get the medkit.  Follow the path
to  the  next switch and use it to open a door and summon another demon.
Kill  him quickly then return to the switch and jump to the ledge on the
right  and  get  the  medkit.   Turn and jump and grab the ledge pulling
yourself  back up to the switch then return to the curved ledge with the
pillar below.

Do  a  safety  drop to the pillar then face the corner and jump over the
pillar  to  a  slope  where you can slide back to the Sphinx.  Enter the
passage  to the left of the Sphinx and get some ammo for the magnum then
enter  the  passage to the left.  When you get to the ramp turn and jump
back  to  begin  the  slide.   Grab the end of the ramp as you fall then
shimmy to the ledge on the left and get the magnum clips.  Climb all the
stairs  on  the  right then go down the slope and dive for the Gold Key.
Exit the water next to the stairs in the corner and return to the top of
the stairs.

This  time  jump  instead of sliding down the slope and grab the bridge.
Use  the  Gold  Key  in the right lock to open the door.  Enter this new
room  and  start  blasting the Centaur.  Get the Ankh and the medkit and
then jump off the bridge.  Climb down all those stairs and dive into the
water climbing out at the stairs in the corner and return to the Sphinx.
Climb  on  that tilted ledge in front of the Sphinx then climb up to the
next  one  and  jump backwards to a third ledge.  Climb up to the magnum
clips then jump to and follow the sandy ledge.

When  you reach a wall turn left and jump to the next ledge and continue
forward  jumping  to  another ledge at the end.  Climb the ledge to your
left  and  jump  to  a  rock  ledge and continue all the way.  Enter the
tunnel  and  push the block on your right so you can get around it.  Get
on  the block and climb to the ledge above it and kill the Centaur.  Get
his Ankh and the medkit and return to the ledge above the Sphinx.  Slide
down  the  long  ramp  to  your right and get the medkit.  Drop onto the
Sphinx  and  kill the panther-mummy then climb onto the tilted ledge and
jump to the small space at the rear of the Sphinx's head.

Go  forward  and  climb to the top of the Sphinx and use the Ankh.  Drop
down  to  the  front  and use the other Ankh.  Climb back to the top and
walk  along  the  left  side of the head until you can't go any further.
Look  down  to  a magical clip floating in the air.  Jump over to it and
land  on an invisible ledge.  You just got the ONLY SECRET in this level
but since its the long awaited UZI that's okay!  Get the ammo to go with
your new toy then jump across to the ledge on the cliff.

Two demons appear so ready your new toy and let the lead fly.  When they
are  dead  you  can  return to the ground and enter the door between the
Sphinx's  legs.   Take a swim going deep and to the left for some shells
then  go between the statues and get the Uzi Ammo.  Surface and recharge
that  air meter then dive down to the right statue and enter the passage
between  its  feet.   Use the switch and let the current take you to the
surface.   Climb onto the low pillar and jump to the other one then jump
to  the steps on the right.  Go up the stairs and slide down into a dark
cave.

There is a demon so quickly take care of the it.  Facing the head on the
left do a safety drop to the ledge below then turn and jump to the ledge
by  the  head.  Walk to the right facing the head and drop down.  Facing
left, jump back and slide down the ramp.  Dive in the water and climb to
the  right  statue and use the switch on his chest to open a door.  Dive
back  in and this time swim into the tunnel between the feet of the left
statue.

When you surface, run up the long slope and get the magnum clips on your
way and get the Scarab at the top.  Now go into the room where you began
this level and fight 2 panther-mummies and a Centaur.  Use the Scarab in
the  lock  after the bloodbath is over and enter through the gate taking
the medkit and magnum clips.  (who leaves all this ammo lying around?)

Go  down  the  slope  and climb up through the hole into the Scion room.
Larson  is back and just begging for you to kill him.  Help him out with
a  few  rounds of gunfire then go up the stairs to the Scion.  EXIT this
level and prepare to enter the Lost Continent of Atlantis.
