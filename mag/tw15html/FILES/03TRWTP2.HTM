Level 6 - Colosseum - Items: 14 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 25

Start  this  level  by  taking  a swim.  Once the crocodile has seen you
climb  to  the bank and shoot the croc.  Swim past the croc and exit the
water.  Shoot the 2 lions guarding the area.  Enter the temple and start
up  the  stairs.   Jump  back  and  kill a third lion that surprises you
(unless you read this first).

Exit  the  temple  and  proceed  down the left side.  Climb up the rocky
ledge and jump over to the temple.  Follow the ledge to the right to get
a  med- kit.  Return the way you came and climb onto the block.  Jump up
onto  the  next ledge and follow it around the temple.  You will have to
jump  along the way.  At the end of the ledge jump diagnally to a hidden
door.

Before  going  in  walk forward and slide down the slope.  Jump when you
reach  the  bottom to land on a small ledge then look to the left of the
water  for a hidden passage.  Do a running jump into the passage and get
SECRET #1 - shotgun shells.  Make your way back to the door and go in.

At  the  edge  of  the  pit  kill  the 2 crocs and get the medkit in the
corner.   Use  the ramp to climb out of the pit then face the wall, jump
and grab the crack in the wall.  Shimmy to the right until you can climb
up  then  go forward to SECRET #2 - more shotgun shells.  Go back to the
crevice  and do a safety drop and shimmy right until you can drop to the
ledge.   Walk  up  the ramp and start down the tunnel until you can drop
down a hole and enter the temple.

Enter the Colosseum to your right and shoot the Lion, Cougar and Gorilla
from your safe vantage point.  During your target practice that guy from
the  last  level starts shooting again.  Fire at him until he runs away.
Jump  into the pit on the left and save your game.  Climb out of the pit
and  use the door at the back corner.  Slide down the ramp and shoot the
2  lions waiting for you.  Go to the far wall and use the switch to open
the  Colosseum  gate.   Turn around and pull the switch to open the door
next to it.  Head down this corridor and into a pit.

Four  cougars  patrol the top of this pit.  You can kill them by jumping
and  shooting  them  at the top of your jumps.  It's dirty but it works.
Climb  out  of the pit when you've killed 1 or 2 of them.  That way they
can't gang up on you.  Head to the rocks and slide down the ramp.  Go to
the back of the room and turn right and stand on the gray floor panel.

Turn  back  and  head to the right gate to get the medkit.  Run back and
when  the  gate  closes  stand on the floor panel again to open the left
gate  which  you can then enter and use the switch.  Then run around the
corner and enter the right gate then through the second gate which is on
a timer (so hurry)!

Pull  the switch in here to open the white door in the chamber.  Go back
outside  and enter the white door.  Go down the slope to the spikes.  Go
through  the  door and climb all the ledges to the top of the Colosseum.
Turn  left  and  head  up the slope then climb the ledge and go right to
find some shells.

Go  back  down  the  rocks to the ledge and stand as far from the pit as
possible facing the rocky slide to the left of the Colosseum door.  Do a
long  jump  to  the  slope and climb up the rocks.  When you reach level
ground  turn  left and jump to the ledge.  Go forward then turn right to
kill the 2 gorillas in the bedroom.

Go  into  the  next  room with the stairs and the block.  Pull the block
until you can enter the tunnel behind it.  Its dark in here but there is
a  medkit  and  a switch - you know what to do with both.  Return to the
rock slide and slide down backwards.

Go  to  your  right  around  the rocks then turn left and proceed to the
ledge  at  the  corner of the Colosseum.  Climb the ledge and go up some
stairs and turn right.  Enter the door and shoot the 2 bats and head for
the  light.   The gate shuts behind you.  Roll into the pit as a boulder
crashes  into  the  gate.   WHEW!   Climb out of the pit and jump to the
other  side.   Follow  the passage to the next switch and use it to open
the door around the corner.  Go through this door and exit the dark room
to your left.

Proceed across the Colosseum floor shooting the cougar that awaits.  You
will  soon  come across that guy again so pump him full of lead until he
runs  away  again.   Keep  advancing  and go up the stairs and enter the
door.   Go  forward  into  the  lit room.  The exit to this room is on a
short timer and only opens when you walk past a certain pillar.

Position  yourself  to  the right of the left pillar and get against the
wall.   The door should be on your right.  Run forward and jump onto the
block  trying  to  land on the right side.  Immediately side-jump to the
right  then  do a backflip then side-jump left and one more jump forward
and through the door (Takes as long to perfect as it did to figure out).

SECRET  #3  has 2 medkits, Uzi clips and the long awaited Magnums - hope
it was worth the effort!  Back at the ledge turn left and jump across to
the  switch  which  opens a door.  Proceed to the bottom and exit out to
the Colosseum and enter the next door.

Climb up to the door you just opened and take a swim into the next room.
There you can push the block forward into the next room.  Enter and save
your  game.   Get  the medkit and use the switch to open the door at the
bottom of those stairs earlier in the game (above the rock slide).  Pull
the  block until you can get behind it and get the Rusty Key.  Swim back
through  the  tunnel  and drop into the dark room and use the right door
along the Colosseum wall.  Watch out for that guy - he may or may not be
back to take a few cheap shots at you.

Drop  to the Colosseum floor and head back to the block ledge in the far
corner.   Kill the lurking gorilla along the way.  Go to the edge of the
pit  and  drop  off  backwards  and  hang.   Shimmy until your shadow is
between spike then drop.  Enter the door with the rocks and climb to the
top  so  you can do that long jump to the rock slide all over again.  Go
back  to  the  bedchamber  (where you killed the 2 gorillas) and use the
Rusty Key to open the gate.

Enter the gate and go swimming and enter the first hole which leads to a
room with a switch.  After pulling the switch go swimming again and keep
swimming down the tunnel until the level is over.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 7 - Palace Midas - Items: 21 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 42

You're  already  swimming  when you start this level so climb out of the
pool  and  head for the tunnel between the pillars.  Kill the 2 gorillas
then  run  ahead  and  through the left door.  Three more gorillas await
your  gunfire in this room.  Pick up the medkit and enter the door.  Use
the  switch  to  open a an unseen gate then run back down the tunnel and
shoot  2 more gorilla near the left door.  Return back to the pool where
you started and shoot the crocodile to your left.

Go  down  the corridor and turn right and keep off the stairs.  Continue
until you reach an intersection then go right to a small gap between the
wall  and  the  cliff.   Kill the gorilla around the corner then get the
magnum clips from inside this small space.

Turn  right  and  move  forward  until  2  lions  attack.  Kill them and
continue until you reach a wall then turn right and shoot 3 bats and get
the  medkit  which  is  almost invisible in the darkness.  Return to the
inter-  section  and  turn right and head back to the stairs you avoided
earlier.

Go  up  and turn left and enter the next room where you can shoot 3 more
gorillas.   Go to the end of the room and climb the orange column.  Turn
and  jump to the next column then turn left and jump to the ledge.  Turn
right  and  jump to the next ledge - grab and pull yourself up.  Get the
medkit  and the magnum clips then jump back to the first ledge then back
to the pillar.

Use  running jumps to cross the series of pillars.  At the last one turn
right  and  jump to the ledge with 5 switches.  Activate the left switch
then turn and drop into a pit and use the switch there to open the gate.
Enter  and  turn left then left again entering a brightly lit door and a
dead gorilla.  Enter the torch room.  Step on the lowered section of the
floor  and  watch  the  torches  go out.  Quickly make a series of jumps
across  the  torches.   If  you  take to long they light themselves (AND
YOU)!   Jump into the water below to put yourself out if you do catch on
fire.  Kill the water rats before coming up to try again.  Grab the last
pillar and pull yourself up as the flame ignites.  You can beat the fire
if you are fast enough.  Get the lead bar.

Swim  to  the stairs and climb up and shoot the gorilla.  Go through the
gate  and  around  to  the  wall  of switches.  Climb up and use the 2nd
switch from the right, the middle switch and return the left switch back
to  the  UP  position.   Drop  down  and enter the gate turning left and
through  a new door between some pillars.  Go through this room and into
a  tunnel  then go down some stairs on the right.  Pull the block out of
the  wall  to  shake  things  up  a bit then head back up the stairs and
continue  up  the  next set of stairs.  The door at the top opens into a
room  with  large  pillars.  Jump over to the right to a dark patch then
jump again to the center column then jump again to the left of the sandy
ledge.  Jump left again and enter the door.

Continue  to  the next room and kill everything that moves.  Jump across
and  into  the  pool  and head down the trench shooting the 2 crocs that
will  eventualy  show  themselves.   When you reach the end of the water
climb  out  and  climb  on  the rocks to your right.  Advance until Lara
cannot go any further then jump forward twice.  You will slide back down
if  you  don't jump twice in a row.  SECRET #1 - medkit and magnum clips
wait for you to the left.

Jump  in  the  water and swim to the left and climb out.  Climb onto the
rail  and  go  to the corner with the small medkit below.  Do the safety
drop  below  to  get  SECRET  #2 - shotgun shells, uzi clips and medkit.
Jump  out  of  the  pit  and  kill the gorilla then move ahead and begin
searching  the small niches in the wall until you find the medkit.  Head
back  to  the  main  alcove that leads to the ledge and jump over to it.
Run  along  the  ledge and kill 2 more gorillas then move to the next to
the last alcove.  Face the wall and jump to the crevice grabbing on then
shimmy  to the left and drop onto the ledge.  Kill the bat then turn and
jump  over  to the door.  Proceed up the long tunnel until you reach the
hex shaped passage.  Run down this collapsible tunnel and get the medkit
then  turn  and  climb  out of the tunnel.  Skid down the long slope and
climb  back  down until you reach the room where you started.  You'll be
on  a ledge and a cougar will be coming at you.  Kill him before he even
gets close then run along the ledge and into the door on the other side.

Follow  the  tunnel  then jump into the left window and out onto a ledge
where you can turn right and make a running jump across.  Turn right and
go  up  to  the pool and take a swim into the next room avoiding the big
crocodile swimming in here with you.

Exit the water and climb onto the rock avoiding the almost invisible gap
and shoot the bat.  Jump over the gap - if you fall in you get to repeat
about  10  minutes as you make your way around to this point again - and
pick  up the lead bar.  Jump to the ledge below and shoot the lions.  Go
down  the  stairs  and  into  the  tunnel  then  turn left and go to the
entrance  room.   Go  left  and  make  your  way back to the room with 5
switches.   Use  the  right  switch  and  return the second to the right
switch to its UP position.  Drop down and left and find the new door and
the floor full of spikes.

WALK  through  the spikes and around the ramp where you can pull another
block a couple times to reveal a tunnel and another switch to use.  Head
back  up  the  ramp and the stair.  At the top go to the corner and do a
standing  jump over the spikes to the column.  Make a series of jumps to
cross  this room starting with the column on your right.  When you reach
the last column jump into the door then jump right back to the column.

You can now safely shoot the gorilla who just woke up in the room beyond
that  door.   When  he's dead enter the room and get the lead bar.  Jump
back  to the pillar then down to the door below taking a small amount of
damage.  Return the the 5 switches and move the middle switch UP and the
far  left switch DOWN then return to the start room with the pool.  Head
down the stairs and into the garden.

Kill  the 2 gorillas and get the medkit off the roof near the back.  You
can get to the roof by climbing the wall on the right.  On the roof turn
and head down the passage to the MIDAS Chamber.  Stand next to the stone
hand  and use the lead bars to turn them to GOLD!.  Return to the garden
and  go  to the right corner next to the gate.  Walk sideways behind the
tree  to  find the concealed lever to open the gate and the final SECRET
#3.   Enter  the  gate and up to the first pair of blades.  Wait for the
blades  to  shut  then  jump through them as they open.  Get the shotgun
shells,  magnum clips and medkit then repeat the process to get past the
blades.

Make  your way back to the orange pillar room then turn left and enter a
new  door.   Continue  forward and kill the lion then head up the stairs
and out onto the ledge.  Get the shotgun shells.  Go down the stairs and
through  the  right door.  Use your new gold bars in each of the 3 slots
then enter the open door and slide down the ramp and finish the level.
