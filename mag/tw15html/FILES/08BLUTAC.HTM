<font color =#4C4CE8>Anyone will tell you that Blu-Tack just isn't safe when I'm around, here
are the best things you can possible do with this wonderful stuff, in no
order whatsoever...

    Roll it into a ball and use it as a Stress-X (tm).

    Feed it to the budgie/mouse/cat and watch them turn blue.

    Make little cones of it and stick them to the joints on your
    hand - 3 on each finger - hey presto, a Speedball glove!

    Press it onto newspaper and lift of the ink.

    Use it to hold two wires together until you find/buy/nick a bit
    or solder.

    Stick speaker wires into awkward corners (yo Wayne!).

    Stick pictures to the wall, although I call this a frivolous
    waste of this marvellous substance.

    Stop your Kelloggs Cornflakes Wallace &amp; Gromit figures falling
    over everytime someone knocks the desk.

    Take a mould of someone's key and then go and get one cut out
    at your friendly neighbourhood locksmith's.

    Drop it in someone's cup of tea, grrrr-oss!

    Stick a huge lump of it on your forehead and say "Hey look, I'm
    the Elephant Man!"

    Stick a layer of compact disks plain side up on the roof of your
    car and pretend it runs on solar power.

    Use it to hold down the switch in your Playstation so that you
    can play all those luvverly gold CD's without forking out £20
    for a chip (eh Bootblock?)

    When someone lets you into a place where the door has a Yale lock,
    stuff a wad of 'Tack into the lock where the tongue is so that it
    holds the lock open.

Chortle, such mirth!  Join with me in praise of the wonderful stuff that
is Blu-Tack (tm), sing!  "Tra-la-la, Blu-Tack is the sav-i-our, phwee!",
White-Tack is for girls!
