<font color =#4C4C58>                        One of Boltys ramblings
<font color =#4C4CE8>
I  swore blind I would NEVER get a peecee.  I hated them.  I argued with
my  flatmates how superior my A1200 was.  Then all of a sudden I decided
to get one.  You go from a peecee hater to a peecee buyer overnight.

Why?   Money!   That's  the key.  If you handed a miggy owner a stlg1500
cheque,  I reckon most would suddenly start reading computer shopper and
they'd have a spanking new wintel box within the week.  Of course they'd
carry  on  using  their Amiga.  But then they get more and more software
and  games  on the peecee until the miggy is as redundant as that Speccy
48K up in the loft.

Well, thats what happened to me anyway.  You see these people called the
students loan company wanted to give me stlg1500.  Of course I made sure
I read the contract properly.  Here is what it said...

1: We will charge sod all interest.
2: Pay us back when you feel like it, or not at all if you're skint.
3: If your skint for ages, we'll forget all about the dosh you owe us.

Hmmm.   Tough choice.  So I got the loan, got the peecee, and have never
looked back since.

Yeah, but why not spend yer cash on a crApple/BeBox/Power Amiga/A-Box?

crApples are crap.  They take 10 years to boot.  They crash.  They don't
multitask.   They  are designed to be used by spastics with the computer
literacy  of  a  badger.   And you can't get any decent games.  And even
then they're hard to come by.

BeBox doesn't exist propely yet.  And even then who wants a poxy twin 60
Mhz  thing.   You could probably get a twin Pentium Pro 200 for the same
dosh (about stlg2500)

Power  Amiga.   Might  solve the mips problem.  But the OS is tired, and
the  custom chips are crumbling.  If the Amiga is to survive, it needs a
radical redesign.

A-Box. Sounds good. Should be released by 2004?

The  only  thing  I  realy miss about the Amiga now is the integral disk
shelf on the back of the keyboard.
