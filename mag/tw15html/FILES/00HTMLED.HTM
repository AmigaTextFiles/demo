If you are new to the word, then read further on in the editorial to see what we are about. This article just sums up the differences between this new HTML version and the Amiga disk version of The Word.
<p>
This is the only article I have added/edited over and above the original disk version, so some articles in the editorial describing use of the mag may not be relevant to this version. 
<p>
The mag should be fairly easy to use, just like any other html document. Hopefully it should run on most browsers which support tables such as Netscape, I-Browse, A-Web etc. Next issue there should be an enhanced version for Micro$oft Internet Explorer 3 or better, featuring continuous music throughout the mag, thanks to some cool html by D!ck.
<p>
The HTML version of the word should be available as a zip archive from the Word Download Site, an lha archive from Aminet, or online at geocities. It has been designed to be perfectly usable with the images switched off, though if you're paying the phone bill, best to download the full thing and view it in all it's glory.
<p>
Please continue to send your articles to the usual places. You can continue to submit your articles in Word format, hopefully the article converter will have been enhanced some more by next issue. If you want to do your own html version though, you can submit a .txt file name in Word format, and a .htm file too. Use the same file name for both and the right extensions! Please make sure your creations work in Netscape 2 or similar, and don't use any frames, which will spag up the whole mag. You can however include links and pictures (up to 30K per article).
