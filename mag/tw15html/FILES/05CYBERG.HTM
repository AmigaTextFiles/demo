 Times  are  changing  and science fiction is fast becoming science fact
and  those  that  call  themselves  cyberpunks  love  it!  Computers are
becoming faster, more powerful and can fit into the palm of your hand or
the  pocket  of  your  windbreaker.  Phones are also smaller and you can
call someone located on the other side of the world while sitting in the
middle  of a park.  You can surf the matrix (net) and hack your way into
corporate  computers  bypassing  their ice (firewalls) and uploading ice
breakers  (crackers)  and  destroying  any  trace  of  your  being there
(viruses).   Yes,  science  fiction has become science fact and whatever
the  next  generation  of  cyberpunk  writers  invent will soon become a
reality.   Just  look  at  the book "Snow Crash".  The matrix is already
here  in  the  form  of  the  internet  and  users can create avatars to
represent themselves on the net.
 There  is  one aspect of cyberpunk culture that also looks like it will
come true.  I'm talking about the future environment.  Where you have to
wear  a  face  mask  when  out  on the street because the environment is
completly fucked up with chemicals, toxins and smog.  The ozone layer is
history and you sleep by day, live by night.
 Although  everyone  knows  we  are  damaging  the  environment with our
current  lifestyles,  there  are people who wish to save the environment
and  some  of  them  are  doing  a good job.  The question I'm asking is
whether true cyberpunks or those of you who at least consider yourselves
to be cyberpunks, should care about your environment?  Most believe that
with  current  technology  we can create an antedote to whatever mess we
make  and  if  this means enviromental suits, face masks and towns being
contained  within  large bubbles then fine, it's the future of cyberpunk
as predicted by the authors of this genre.

 Can a cyberpunk be green?
