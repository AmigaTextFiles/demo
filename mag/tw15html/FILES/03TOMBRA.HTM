 First  off  I  don't  own  a  Playstation  but this is the version I am
reviewing.   I first played the demo of Tomb Raider on Kenco's PSX and I
was hooked!  However I had just got my PC so buying a PSX was out of the
question.   On  a recent trip to London I ended up playing the full game
Tomb  Raider  on  Amida's PSX using his memory card to save my progress.
Recently  Amida  paid me a visit and thoughtfully brought his PSX, along
with  the memory card holding my last saved position.  Although I didn't
complete  the  game  before  he left (he has now erased my position so I
have  to  start  again)  I did however get more addicted to the game.  I
still cannot afford a PSX yet so untill I can, here's my review...

 Some  of you die hard gamers out there may already own a PSX or console
of  some  description  as  well as your trusty Amiga so you are probably
familiar  with  3D games of this kind.  However I generally play graphic
adventure  games like Simon The Sorcerer (Amiga) and Discworld (PC) so I
am not.
 Tomb  Raider  is based around a character who seems to enjoy exploring,
doing athletics and generally killing anything that moves which includes
a wide range of animals so this might not appeal to most people.
 The  object  is  to  solve  puzzles and generally reach the end of each
level  or  the  next save point (represented by a rotating blue diamond)
without dying.

<font color =#887058> The  character  has a whole range of moves which are so smooth that you
can't  help messing around to get the hang of them all.  She can jump up
in  the  air  and get a grip of a ledge so she can pull herself up, roll
across  the  ground, pull out the current weapon or do body flips in any
direction you wish.  There is one level where you have to run up a ramp,
body  flip  backwards then sideways, get a grip and do it again to climb
to  the  top  of  a  building.  These moves alone will make Mel C of the
Spice Girls jealous!
 The  guns  range  from twin pistols to a shotgun or uzi's.  The pistols
hang  in a gun belt around her waist where they can be easily retrieved.
With  the  PSX  joypad  you have the ability to do multiple moves at the
same  time.  For instance, you can start running, pull out your guns and
fire  and  aim  while still running.  The shotgun is slung over her back
and is very useful for getting rid of nosey dinosaurs, permanently.

<font color =#887058> This  sets  the  atmosphere  in  Tomb  Raider.  The music is so good it
should  be sampled to tape!  When it suddenly gets pacy you should start
to get worried!  Or if there is no music for a while then some starts up
it  generally  means  you've reached a point where something is about to
happen.


<font color =#4C4C4C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Playability</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#887058> This  game  is  really  addictive.   I  was  playing  it  on a 28" SONY
Trinitron with sound stereo and the volume whacked up because it was the
only  TV  in  the  house  with  a SCART socket.  If you get stuck at any
point, you don't get bored because you can check out your environment by
testing  your  skills at manipulating your character.  Pulling your guns
out  and  firing at targets while body flipping is a favourite past time
of  mine.   If really bored, fall over waterfalls, drawing your guns mid
leap to see how many shots you can get off before you hit the surface.
 This game is extremely playable and unlike most games, you are actually
rewarded  when you complete a level by being treated to amazing rendered
animtions.   The  last anim I saw was her riding the elelevator so maybe
most  of you are all past me now?  Those that are not and haven't played
this game yet, do so!


<font color =#4C4C4C>OVERALL: 90%

<font color =#887058>The  sample  of  cracking bones when she falls from a great hight has an
effect  like  somebody  dragging chalk across the blackboard, it gets on
your nerves!
