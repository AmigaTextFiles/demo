<font color =#D0D0FF>
I  have just finished watching Vanessa (sad, I know.  Anyway the date is
19/03/97) and they were talking about kidnapping.
<font color =#D0C4FF>
A  bloke  (Shaun,  and  his wife) were being terrorised by a teenager on
their estate (throwing bricks at their car/window/etc, cutting the brake
line on the car, and other stuff like that).
<font color =#D0B8FF>
They  told  the  police countless times, but they didn't do anything (as
per fuckin' usual).
<font color =#DCACFF>
So,  the  Shaun  geeza and a couple of his mates were driving in his car
when  suddenly 2 bricks hit the car.  Shaun looked out to see that, that
tosser had thrown them.
<font color =#E8ACFF>
Then  before  Shaun knew it, the teenager was in his car (one of Shaun's
mates must have bundled him into the car - so that's what he thinks) and
they were driving away.
<font color =#F4ACFF>
They kept asking the tosser why he kept terrorising his family.

Anyway,  there  were  two more people talking about their experiences of
being kidnapped.
<font color =#FFACFF>
Currently,  Shaun  and  his wife are living apart, because this teenager
cunt  is going around the estate with a big gang, and making their lives
hell.
<font color =#FFACF4>
The  audience  (in Vanessa) were ripping the shit out of the Shaun bloke
saying  stuff like "he'll (the teenager) be emotionally scard, etc" (and
other GOBSHITE) and saying that it's digusting, etc.
<font color =#FFACE8>
                             What a load of

How  can  people  be  so fuckin' thick!?  The other two people that were
talking about being kidnapped say they were held at knife-point and were
<font color =#FFB8B8>abused.   Incase  the  audience didn't know, that Shaun thing WASN'T
violent and the teenager was making their (Shaun, his wife &amp; 3 children)
life total HELL.  The teenager fuckin' DERSERVED IT.
<font color =#FFC4B8>
What  gives  the little fucker the right to make someones' life hell for
no reason what-so-ever??
<font color =#FFD0B8>
He  wasn't  "emotionally  scard"  (can't  spell  that),  the bastard was
probably  laughing  about  it  and  telling  all  his  mates that he was
<font color =#FFDCB8>"kidnapped"  (which he really wasn't, as none of it was planned, and
he was only in the car for 10 mins).

What  gets  me is that, how can the audience be so god damn well fuckin'
<font color =#FFE8B8>STUPID!?   The  Shaun  situation  was TOTALLY DIFFERENT to the other
fuckin' two.

Some  stupid  old  bitch  in  the  audience  says that if he (Shaun) had
<font color =#FFF4B8>kidnapped her son, she'd have "killed him".  The teenage twat nearly
fucking  KILLED  Shaun's 3 fuckin' children and was tampering with their
car (which resulted in three crashes, which could've also killed
<font color =#FFFFB8>innocent  people)  and  lobbing  bricks  at them and things.  WHAT A
FUCKIN'
<font color =#FFFFD0>THICK OLD BIDDY.
<font color =#F4FFC4>
I  can't  take  this,  better stop typing before I fuckin' well combust,
<font color =#E8FFC4>outta' here .....
