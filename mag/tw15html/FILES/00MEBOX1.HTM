 Remember  when  you  used to ask me "Where do you find the time?".  Now
I'm  asking you the same question!  You ALWAYS seem to be on-line when I
login.   Your  web  page(s) are updated each time I check them out.  You
write  articles  for  The Word 5 minutes after I've asked for some more.
As  well as this you manage to send me jiffies, come up with the time to
think  of  ways  of  improving The Word and it's distribution and to get
other  people  involved  in helping you out.  I tell ya, you gotta be on
pills or just not sleeping at all!  Keep it up!  ;)

 The  clock  looks cool.  I was thinking of maybe adding another code to
each  article like Ruiner does with Phreaking Only's articles.  This one
will  tell  the engine that the article has a name and it should display
that  name  on the header bar at the top of the screen (left hand side).
This  title  should  be restricted in length so as not to over-write the
clock  or dissappear off the end of the screen.  What do you think?  The
code could be "|T" for title followed by a maximum of 60 characters.  So
if it was "|TAmida sez hi" it would look something like:

 Amida sez hi                                                  00:07:23

 Sorry to hear that the law finally caught up with you mate.  I said you
should lie low especially after the postal service warned you about that
little  bit  of fraud you were carrying out.  Let me know when your time
is  up.   If you post anything to my old address it should get forwarded
at  some  point so I'll get to hear from you no problem.  Keep your back
to the wall in jail and don't bend over for the soap!  ;)

 If  you  EVER do get that video back then let me know as so far I can't
replace  one  of the 3 films on it (2nd one) because you just cannot get
it inside the UK!  and I want another copy.  Also, let Koony know of any
change  of  address so he can update THEGUYS so we all know how to reach
you.

 Hey  Mike.   Have  you  moved  into your new house yet?  You seem to be
lying  low  at  present.  I know the Laluna BBS went down hence no email
for  you.   Someone  kept telling me to remove the email for you from my
mailing  list!   Very  annoying.  I have to remove the software daemon I
wrote for my university UNIX account as well so they don't find it after
I've  left.   Very  faithfull that patch.  It gave me unlimited incoming
email and patched the account user name so I could be anyone I wanted to
be.  I'll miss it.  Sniff.  ;)


To: Any H/P/A/C/V dude reading this
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 Phreaking  Only  is permanently on hold due to legal reasons at present
but  we  are considering incorporating any H/P/A/C/V scene news into The
Word  in the near future so if you want to send greets/news/general info
to  your contacts as well as articles from this scene then they would be
very  much  welcomed.   Although  The  Word is written on an Amiga it is
converted  on  a  PC to HTML for the on-line version so there is a wider
audience  out  there  for  you  to  reach.  Besides, one of our many new
moto's is "Bridging the gap between the scenes".


To: Andy Bolt
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 PC's  are not that bad.  However they are not as "user friendly" as the
Amiga I can tell you.  Cheers for all your help and pledge of support so
far.   Sorry  I'm  going  off-line  for  a short while but Amida will be
around to help ya out or answer any questions.

 What  happened  to you matey?  You did a disappearing act on me.  I was
hoping  for  that  info  on  Ipswich  but  I'll  be there by the time it
arrives.  Hopefully I'll still get to meet you when I finally move in?


To: Chris Ainsley
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 Cheers  for  the  info  on Ipswich and for the floor space (hopefully).
The laptops bulging with goodies for ya.


To: Carp/Loadsa groups..
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 Thanks  for  your  pledge  of  support and tell your contacts that we'd
appreciate  any support they are willing to give.  Any news files, group
infos or articles are appreciated.  The Word Charts is an idea I suppose
but  every  other  e-zine  has  one  already  so it would basically be a
re-iteration  unless  you  can come up with a new twist on an old theme?
Just how many groups are you in now?  ;)


To: Dave Diamond
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 You  do  write about touchy subjects don't you?  Every time I've edited
an  article  I  flick  the screen page to D-OPUS to move the file into a
directory  that  it  best  suits.   For some reason your's all end up in
"08-" the Adult directory!  Weird that..  ;)


To: Iceman/Carnage
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 Hey  Rich!  I'm gonna miss those large sends of yours while I'm getting
settled  into my new place.  I bet your phone bill is pretty big.  Funny
that  as  my phone bills were always a fiver when I used to modem.  Must
of been a fault on the line.  ;)


To: Stelf/Vortex &amp; Case/Vortex
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 Good  luck  with  the new group.  We need more UK groups.  I think your
news  file  got  here ok but that LZX file that Case emailed me came out
this  end  as a messy octet stream that LZX recognised as an LZX archive
with no contents.  Please use LHA next time!

 PC's  and  Amiga's  are different with regards to architecture not just
CPU's.   I  can  write  in Mandarin (Chinese) so I could do the task you
mentioned!  (see part 2 of messages).

 Here's Kei in Mandarin (ascii):

                                __|_|_
                                  |_|
                                  |_|
                                __|_|_  
                                 / . \
                                / -+- \
                               / __|__ \ 

Please don't anyone start sending me any Mandarin texts for translation!
However, if you want Chinese porno mags, I'm yer man!  ;)

 I  was going to do an article on Kate Russell from the computer channel
but  I'm  nackered after typing so many articles and editing the rest as
it  is  so I'll just mention here (quickly) that, how come she makes you
watch  the  computer channel when you already know what they are talking
about  anyway?   It's  either that voice, those eyes or that interesting
ruby red lipstick she wears.  Your thoughts are appreciated!
