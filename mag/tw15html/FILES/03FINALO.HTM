Greek  Mythology  informs  us  that  the King of Minos imposed an annual
tribute  for  7  girls  to be shipped to Crete and thrown as food to the
hideous  creature  called  the  Minotuar  who  resides in a vast magical
labyrinth in Athens.

In  this  elaborate  adventure  game you play the part of Theseus who is
responsible  for  taking the poor girls to their death, however you have
another plan in mind.

To break this revolting tradition and to ensure no more innocent victims
need  to  face this destiny it is up to you to solve the complex puzzles
and  mysteries  of  the Labyrinth and eventually destroy the Minotaur as
well  as  locating  all  the girls that have been imprisoned and getting
them out safely.

The  Final  Odyssey  combines logic puzzle solving with plenty of action
and strategy, you will be armed with the most sophisticated weaponry and
be  thrown  into a mind melting logical world of traps, enemies, puzzles
and mini quests.

The   unique  dungeon  designs  create  constantly  changing  levels  in
gloriously  animated  splendour coupled with true 3d sound effects which
all help to create a world that is very hard to leave.
