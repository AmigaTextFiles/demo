 For  those  who  do  not have access to SKY on the ASTRA satellites you
will  not  know  what  I  am talking about but this is a review of the 2
programs   "Xena:    Warrior   Princess"  and  "Hercules  The  Legendary
Journeys".  I believe Hercules may of started showing on Channel 5.

 SKY viewers had this dropped in their laps starting with episode one of
season  1.   However  we  were  not  informed  till  later  that we were
suppossed  to  of seen the 5 pilot films for this series which of course
SKY showed later on it's movie channels.
 The  basic  storyline  is set in ancient Greece where the gods rule and
are  complete  bastards when they feel like it.  Zeus is the king of the
gods  and  he is married to Hera, the queen of the gods.  Zeus got horny
one  day  and screwed with a mortal who produced an offspring, Hercules.
An  early question at the start of the series and in the pilot films was
whether Hercules was imortal or not being the son of a god and a mortal.
The  question was answered recently as yes but he is more vunerable than
a god.  The difference is that imortals cannot be killed by conventional
weapons  but  can  be  killed  by  a god.  A god is also imortal but has
powers which they can use to travel between the earth, underworld (Hades
domain) and the valley of the gods.  A mortal can become a god by eating
the  food  of  the  gods,  ambrosia (not the Devon cream!) which kind of
looks  like those squishy sweets kids eat (shaped like bottles) and when
there's  a  lot  of  it,  it looks like a jelly.  Ambrosia is located in
various  places  on the earth but you usually have to complete a task to
get at it proving you a worthy to be a god.
 With  that  in  mind,  a  few mortals do become gods and end up as real
bastards.   Take Callisto for instance, a very beautiful bitch that will
kill you as soon as look at you.
 So here we have Hercules then and his friend Iolaus who travel all over
helping people out because he got pissed at Hera for killing his family.
Hera  only  ever  appears  in  Hercules as a pair of eyes represented by
peacock  feathers.   Her  presence  is usually acknowledged by a falling
peacock feather.  Strange I know but hey...
 So  the  basic  story  each  episode is Hercules has to complete a task
which  is  usually delivered to him in the form of someone running up to
him  saying  "Hercules  we  need your help..." and the gods interfere to
prevent  him  from  saving the day or because today (like any other day)
they want him dead.
 Ares  is  the  god of war and Hercules half brother and tends to be the
current  main openent to Hercules along with his nephew Strife.  This is
where  the two series, Hercules and Xena overlap.  Xena was a prodigy of
Ares  because  she  killed everyone in great battles and Hercules turned
her  around.   Xena was spawned from the Hercules series and luckily SKY
shows  them  in  sync so when something happens in Hercules (ie Callisto
being  imprisoned  in  the  tomb  of  the  imortal giving apple tree) it
happened  in  the  current  Xena  time  line  so  she can comment or use
whatever occured in Hercules (she released Callisto in order to help her
complete  her  task)  so  when you watch either program on SKY it's like
watching  the  same  place  through  the  eyes  of  different people and
occasionally characters cross over into the other series.

<font color =#7C644C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>XENA</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#FFFFB8>
 Xena  is  a  beautiful  brunette (Lucy Lawless) with sidekick Gabrielle
(Rene  O'Conner) who basically helps people out like Hercules but people
don't tend to run up to her and say "Xena you gotta help me..".  If they
do  run  up to her they usually stop and stare and receive a twak on the
head.
 Xena's  reputation  still  preceeds  her.   She's  still  regarded as a
murderer  whether  she's  trying  to  make  up  for it or not and so she
generally  gets  attacked.   This  seems  to happen a lot by bandits and
soldiers  who  recieve  a good kicking for their trouble.  This is where
reality  takes  a back seat.  The fights usually feature gravity defying
stunts  which  ok,  might  be  realistic  with Hercules and his god-like
strength  but  Xena?   There's  lots of flying and body flips that would
make world famous gymnasts jealous!
 The  character  Callisto  was  created in this series.  Xena (when bad)
killed  her  parents and burned her village to the ground.  She became a
psychopath  determined  to destroy Xena but enjoying the process.  She's
very sadistic but she's so good looking that you can't help cheering her
on  when she's fighting Xena.  The producers thought that the characters
were  so  good  when  together  that  instead  of  spawning a new series
featuring  Callisto  they  never  completly kill her off so she can come
back  in  either  Xena  or Hercules.  They even did a few episodes where
Xena  and  Callisto  swapped  bodies  for a few episodes so Lucy Lawless
wasn't in it.  Instead Hudson Leick (Callisto) played Xena in Callisto's
body  which was a bitch for Gabrielle as Callisto had killed her husband
about 5 minutes after they were married!
 Callisto  was  killed by Xena and sent to the underworld where the dead
go.   In  these  series you never truley die.  You either go to Tardaris
(Hell)  or the Alysian Fields (Heaven).  You can come back only if a god
allows  it.  Ares brought Callisto back to kill Xena and replace her but
she failed and got sent back to hell in Xena's body.  Hera then gave her
another  chance  but she had to kill Hercules.  She failed again but was
left  trapped  in  a  tomb  after  eating  a golden apple which made her
imortal  so  she  could  not  commit  suicide and had to live on rats or
starve.   Xena freed her to help her complete a task which was to kill a
female  amazon  warrior  who  recently  became a god by eating ambrosia.
Callisto  agrees  as  long  as she gets ambrosia in return.  A memorable
scene  is where the amazon throws Callisto at a rock face, Callisto gets
back  up  and walks over to her saying "You don't just kill me then walk
away!".   Callisto double crosses Xena and gets the ambrosia herself and
becomes  a  god.   A mortal becoming a god is represented by small black
pupils  in  the eyes whereas normal gods have normal eyes (except Hera).
Xena  sends Callisto and the amazon into a pit of molten lava where they
are currently solidified as rocks statues in a fighting stance.

<font color =#FFFFB8>If you want to watch something that you don't really need to think about
that  presents you with loads of beautiful women in tightly clad leather
and  lace swinging swords then these 2 series are for you!  There's even
a rumour that Gabrielle and Xena have a lesbian scene towards the end of
the current season.  Not that I'm looking forward to it or anything...
