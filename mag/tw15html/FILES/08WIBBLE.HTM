Okay  me  ickle (TFI Friday is a bit poo!) children, here are some of my
thorts  (gimme  `em back when you're finished, okay?) that don't exactly
<font color =#B8F4E8>warrant a seperate article each .....

Well,  what  can  I  say  about the best programme in the whole god-damn
world?
<font color =#FFB84C>
Is  there  gonna  be  a  7th  series?   Or has it finished for good, all
because  Chris Barrie wanted to "develope" that fooking `Gorden Brittas'
<font color =#FFC44C>character tosser in The Brittas Empire?  Stupid gitty-git.

Hey,  what  about  the  O  sexy red gurl?  Kochanski?  PWOAR!  I `fink I
<font color =#FFD04C>might  be  in  lURVE!  Chloë Annett, I even know her name, so I must be!
It's  that  smile!   And  when she laffs, OOOH!  (damn, I've just had an
<font color =#FFD04C>accident in me pants ....)

Anyway,  why  did the bloody BBC keep us all waiting for at least over a
<font color =#FFDC4C>year  before putting series 6 (the last one, as far as I know anyway) on
the  telly?   When  do  the  rest of the world get to see it?  And guess
<font color =#FFE84C>what?   Red  Dwarf  had a budget just big enough to by a packet of salty
peanuts!  A messie to Grant &amp; Naylor...  KEEP THE BLADDY SERIES GOING!
<font color =#FFFFFF>
         [The BBC, fickle as ever, were waiting for the result
         of Craig's Raspe trial, as soon as it was over he got a
         part in The Bill (as a teacher) and the new series
         started filming - D!]
<font color =#FFDC4C>
Crime Traveller is pretty good (only coz Chloë is in it!) ....

I really hate these people.  People that get into summat just because of
<font color =#A0C4FF>all  the  hype.  These include the people who join the InterNET (look, I
<font color =#ACC4FF>like  typing it like that, OKAY?) and have NO IDEA what the hell they're
<font color =#B8C4FF>doing.

<font color =#C4C4FF>If it was up to me (which of course it isn't), everyone has to pass some
<font color =#D0C4FF>kind  of test (a rite of passage, as it were).  For example knowing some
<font color =#DCC4FF>HTML  tags  and  explaining what addresses (pooter wise) are.  Of course
<font color =#E8C4FF>people who use Amigas and know how to do simple-ish things (manipulating
<font color =#F4C4FF>files via the Shell, etc) don't have to "pass the test".

<font color =#FFC4FF>Apparently,  raytracing  peeps  need  to do a raytrace of a train-set as
<font color =#FFD0FF>some  sort  of  rite of passage (that's what D!ck sez anyway).  But why?
<font color =#FFDCFF>People  that  can  raytrace  surely  must  know what they're doing.  But
<font color =#FFE8FF>people  on  the  InterNET  don't.   I  can't do a train-set, as creating
<font color =#FFF4FF>objects  is  WEIRD.   Using  4  different  view-points  (top,  sides and
<font color =#FFFFFF>perspective)  to  create  the  object,  it  looks  good.   But once I've
<font color =#FFF4FF>rendered/raytraced  it,  is  looks shagged!  Anyway, me processor (020 @
<font color =#FFE8FF>28Mhz)  isn't  fast  enough for me to experiment as much as I'd like to.
<font color =#FFDCFF>I'm just getting into using fog effects now.  I'm using Cinema4D II (the
<font color =#FFD0FF>Imagine  programs  are  SHITE!),  hopefully  I'll  have  v3 so I can use
<font color =#FFC4FF>visible  light  effects (fireballs, lasers, etc).  Real3D V2 looks good,
<font color =#FFB8FF>but  I  keep  getting a bloody Guru (8000000B) whenever I try to run it.
<font color =#FFACFF>It was given away on a AmigaFormat coverdisc (as was Cinema4D II).

<font color =#FFACF4>I  also  H8  (hate)  people  that use massively hyped words (Information
<font color =#FFACF4>SuperHighway,  Surfing  the  `NET,  and  other  such  gobshite) and they
<font color =#FFACDC>haven't got a CLUE what they're talking `bout.

<font color =#FFB8AC>
<font color =#FFC4AC>Look,  I know what I'm talking `bout here.  The sun IS the other side of
<font color =#FFD0AC>the  moon!   Why  doesn't anyone believe me?  (hey, this is exactly what
<font color =#FFDCAC>Kryten  said  when  he  was talking about how heavy Kochanski's lingerie
<font color =#FFDCA0>was!)  Ahh,  "What about when you can see the sun &amp; the moon at the same
<font color =#FFDC94>time  and  they're  at  the opposite ends of the sky?".  Easy, there's a
<font color =#FFDC88>great  big glass dome around the earth and it's just a dodgy reflection.
<font color =#FFDC7C>Where'd  you think the blue in the sky comes from?  If it wasn't for the
<font color =#FFDC70>dome, the sky wouldn't be *any* colour.

<font color =#ACFFB8>
<font color =#ACFFC4>
<font color =#ACFFD0>
Ahhh...  it's the ye ol' tracing paper/bog roll peanut (chestnuts always
<font color =#ACFFDC>get  the  credit).  If you've ever had the mis-fortune of using a public
<font color =#ACFFE8>bog  for  a  dump, you'll no doubt have tried wiping yer botty with this
<font color =#ACFFF4>stuff.  Before you know it, you've got poo spread all over yer back like
<font color =#ACFFFF>a  chocolate spread sarnie.  I haven't been to any public bogs for years
<font color =#ACFFFF>(thank  gord!),  so the goverment might have replaced that tracing paper
<font color =#ACF4FF>with something a bit more absorbant than a varnished wooden floor.
<font color =#FFFFFF>
[Yeah, they have, but people keep nicking it - D!]

<font color =#ACE8FF>If  you  want  to create the effect of spreading poo all over your back,
<font color =#ACDCFF>just  subsitute  your  super  absorbant  poo  roll for a floppy (ploppy,
<font color =#ACD0FF>geddit?)  disk  and you'll see how far a lump of plop can go (try adding
<font color =#ACC4FF>some  raw  mashed  spuds to it, it goes MUCH further).  If you're lucky,
<font color =#ACB8FF>you may have enough to paint your dog with whats left.

<font color =#B8B8FF>Do  you  want  to  see what seaweed looks like after you've digested it,
<font color =#C4B8FF>WITHOUT  actually  eating  any?  Just eat lots of lettuce, and then when
<font color =#D0B8FF>you  have  a  plop,  you'll  see  it  floating mid-way in the bog water!
<font color =#DCB8FF>Magic!

"C'mon, dance wiv me, move your body, dance wiv me", etc...

<font color =#DCFF7C>That's  enough of that.  It appears EN-GAR-LUND (yeeee!) is becoming the
<font color =#D0FF7C>MUSIC CAPITAL of the world.  Good!  Okay, here are the official (um....)
<font color =#C4FF7C>"capitals" of the world ....
<font color =#A0FFFF>
    MUSIC          - England.
<font color =#ACFFFF>    GENERAL TELLY  - England (see later).
<font color =#B8FFFF>    TELLY SOAPS    - England/Austrailia (Aussie is VERY debateable!).
<font color =#C4FFFF>    FILMS          - America (bollockin' wankers!).
<font color =#D0FFFF>    FEMALES        - England.
<font color =#DCFFFF>    HEALTH SERVICE - England. (this is a FACT!)
<font color =#DCFFF4>    SWEETS         - England. (best chocky ever!)
<font color =#DCFFE8>    SHEEPS         - New Zealand. (where's the old one go, then?)
<font color =#DCFFDC>    VIOLATORS      - Spain.
<font color =#DCFFD0>    MOOSES         - Canada.
<font color =#DCFFC4>    PLAIN SCARY    - Russia.
<font color =#DCFFB8>    SPAZ CENTRAL   - Brussels, Germany.

<font color =#DCFFC4>See  my  other  article  "American  GiTS!"  to see what exactly I've got
<font color =#DCFFD0>against  the  Americans,  and why I chose England as the "General Telly"
<font color =#DCFFDC>capital (coz America sure ain't).

<font color =#DCF4DC>Did  you know the Spice Girls are the supposed to be the most successful
<font color =#DCE8DC>band  of  ALL TIME at this very moment in time?  Well, ya do now!  Mel-C
<font color =#DCDCDC>is  still  me  fave!   She  looks very cute when she's got her hair down
<font color =#DCD0DC>and lookin' sexy, but Chloë Annett IS THE BABETTE OF ALL TIME!

<font color =#DCD0E8>Has  anyone  seen  the  lead  singer  gal of Jam &amp; Spoon?  She has a gr8

<font color =#FFACA0>WARNING:   We,  TrF-RipOffs,  have  discovered that the Spegetthi (god I
<font color =#FFACAC>hate  trying  to spell that word) from the No Frills label tastes like a
<font color =#FFACB8>Dentist's  sterile  glove.   Very  synthetic, makes yer mouth tingle and
<font color =#FFACC4>dries  rock hard on contact.  Be careful, without any warning, you might
<font color =#FFACD0>get  a big needle shoved into yer gums and you might hear a voice saying

<font color =#ACD0DC>he  gets  ??  I thought I just had to go for a check-up, but guess what?
<font color =#ACD0D0>Before I knew it, I had a sand-blaster in me gob spurting blood all over
<font color =#ACD0C4>the fookin' place.  He said it was just a jet of water.  Me pooh hole it
<font color =#ACD0B8>was!   It  felt like a bit of hot metal.  While he was "jetting away", I
<font color =#ACD0AC>thought  I  was gonna drown (the scariest way to go methinks)!  After he
<font color =#ACD0A0>had finished, there was blood on my jacket (yup D!ck, THAT blue one!), I
<font color =#ACD094>had a gob full of blood and I was in immense pain.
<font color =#FFD094>
The tosser wants me to go back soon for a checkup, ha ha...  right.

<font color =#DCA0FF>
A  slightly  more serious subject here.  I have always hated school, and
<font color =#E8A0FF>twagged  ("bunked  off")  all  the time.  I absolutely hated, coz it was
<font color =#F4A0FF>SHITE!  What did I learn?  The most useful (and painful!) thing I learnt
<font color =#FFA0FF>was, how to get beaten up.  Yeh, very useful I'm sure.

<font color =#FFA0F4>Thinking about it, I don't `fink I've "suffered" at all.  Me spelling is
<font color =#FFA0E8>pretty good (well I think it is) and I'm not totally stupid (erm....).

<font color =#FFA0DC>But  the  thing  is,  the people that I know that went to school all the
<font color =#FFA0D0>time  and  they're  now  at college, can't spell properly at all.  But I
<font color =#FFA0C4>can.

<font color =#FFA0B8>Me  sister's  video  recorder shagged itself about a week ago, we phoned
<font color =#FFA0AC>the  Radio  Rentals  bloke  (we  bought it from Radio Rentals and it was
<font color =#FFA0A0>under  3 months warranty (I can't spell that word that begins with "Gua"
<font color =#FFA094>properly!)  and  he came to have a gander at it.  Am I the only that has
<font color =#FFAC94>noticed  this,  that whatever you tell them, they totally ignore you?  I
<font color =#FFB894>told  him that there's fuzz when playing a tape, he tried it but it just
<font color =#FFC494>HAPPENED  to  work  properly when he tried it (donch'a just HATE it when
<font color =#FFD094>that  happens??).   So I told him to try another tape (the Turtles film)
<font color =#FFDC94>to show him what normally happens when it goes all fuzzy.  He said there
<font color =#FFE894>was  a crack on the plastic.  But I just wanted him to play it so he can
<font color =#FFF494>see  what HAPPENS when it DOES go fuzzy, as the Turtles tape creates the
<font color =#FFFF94>same  effect.   He  just  wouldn't  have any of it.  Any-bloody-way, the
<font color =#F4FF94>crack  on  the tape was TINY and on the outside, so it had NOTHING to do
<font color =#E8FF94>with the quality of playback.  The stupid twat.

<font color =#E8F494>Anyway,  back  to  the point.  When I told him everything that was wrong
<font color =#E8E894>with  it, he wrote it all down.  I later had a look at the bit of paper,
<font color =#E8DC94>he  can't even spell !  He spelt "Quality" as "Qualitee" and summat else
<font color =#E8D094>I've forgotten.  Doh!
<font color =#A0A0A0>
                                  ---
<font color =#FFF4FF>
Anyway,  that's  all I can be BUMHOLED to type (and the filesize of this
<font color =#FFE8FF>article  is over 9k now), AND I've got to insert a load of colour codes!
<font color =#FFDCFF>Argh!
<font color =#FFD0FF>
So I'll leave you with ......
