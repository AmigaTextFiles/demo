To get your copy of THE WORD from issue 12 onwards follow the following
steps...

<font color =#4C4C88><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>What do I do then?</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#FFFFB8>
    1.  Format 2 disks, make sure there are no errors on them...

    2.  Select a jiffy of sufficient volume to hold 2 disks and
        perhaps a piece of paper.

    3.  Write the following on said jiffy:  The Word - DiskBack
                                            41 Lambourne Drive
                                            Marton-In-Cleveland
                                            Middlesbrough
                                            TS7 8QF

         ** This address is only valid untill 15th July 1997 **

From  then  on I'll be living in Ipswich and I'll update Word 16 with my
new  address.   If  you  send  anything to the above address it will get
forwarded  but  there  will  be a slight delay.  There is an alternative
address which you can use between July and August which is Amida's:

                                 Koony
                            59 Waldeck Road
                             Turnpike Lane
                                 London
                                 N15 3EL

You can send articles to his email address as well: Koony@pito.org



<font color =#FFFFB8>
    4.  Stick a 1st class stamp on it.

    5.  Drop two 1st class stamps into it, along with your disks.

    6.  Write your name and address on either a piece of paper or a
        sticky label that's big enough to cover the address on the
        front of the jiffy.

    7.  Seal it, and if you feel like it, write your address on the
        back as well, just in case like...

<font color =#4C4C88><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>When should I post it?</CENTER></FONT></B>



<font color =#FFFFB8>
If  you're sending articles on your disks (write:  arts included on disk
label)  then obviously it's better if you post them as soon as possible,
if  not  (and WHY not?) then wait about four weeks from the release date
of the LAST issue (which would be this one, presumably) before posting.
Although lately The Word has been a monthly release.

<font color =#4C4C88><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>What do we do?</CENTER></FONT></B>



<font color =#FFFFB8>
    First  I  check  your  disks for articles or letters (you can send a
covering  letter on the disk if you prefer not to annoy your neighbours/
parents  with  your  rattly  old 9-pin), and if I find any then they are
copied  to  a  drawer  on  my  harddrive,  but left on the disks JUST IN
CASE...

The  disks can be Amiga OFS/FFS disks or PC 720/1.44 disks.  If PC disks
I  can  probably fit The Word disks in DMS format on one 1.44 floppy but
it's  safer  to  send two!  Sometimes I do an ad-hoc version of the Word
for  PC  users  who  may  wish  to  read it on their PC.  Please specify
whether you want the Word back in DMS/Full/HD format.  If you included a
covering  letter  that is written in a way that expects a reply then you
may  get  one but it will be on one of your disks with the Word also but
in  DMS  format.   DMS format is better for traders as you don't have to
DMS  it  yourself  as it has already been virus checked and DMS verified
beforehand.

Then I prepare your jiffy for posting, by removing the stamp and putting
one of the loose ones on, removing/covering my address with your address
and then putting your disks back in.  The ready jiffy is then put into a
SPAR carrier bag ready for me to head to the post box upon Word release.
I  get these weird looks from the post office staff sometimes as I stand
there posting all those jiffies of yours!  They all know me you see from
the times I had to pay my fines there.  ;)

Note:   Please  do  NOT  attach  the  stamps to an SAE.  If you do, only
attach one!

<font color =#FFFFB8>
Then when the mag is finished and DMS'd onto my harddrive, I spend a few
minutes/hours making copies on all the disks in that drawer and drop 'em
in the post to you, generally on a Friday morning.  The Word is released
5  days before the official release date listed on the loading ascii but
only to members of Carnage, traders for Carnage and Diskback peeps so it
arrives on your doormat on time!

The  Word can be downloaded from Remote Kontrol BBS (01642 650120) 24hrs
7  days  at 28.8k or via...

<font color =#FFFFB8>
 When  I took over The Word it was mainly a UK based disk magazine hence
it's non-appearance in the international scene charts (vote for us!) and
I  wanted  it  to  be  read  further  afield than the UK because today's
computing  scene  has  no  borders.   With  the  internet  we can travel
anywhere our imagination takes us so why not with The Word?
 However there was one aspect I did not take into consideration, readers
abroad  cannot send me UK stamps!  I therefore had to use all the stamps
I got from the diskback service to send these jiffies back overseas!
 During  recent  talks  with  contacts  we have decided to set up a Word
distribution   network   abroad   and   along  with  the  Word  on-line,
distribution problems will soon disappear.  However, untill it does.  as
well as the above, the overseas readers have to:

 * Send a postcard from their home town/area with the jiffy
   (postcardware) instead of a stamp.

 * Distribute The Word to at least 2 people outside of the UK.

 * Write a minimum of 2 articles. (Adverts accepted but not counted as
   an article)

ThanX
