D!crosoft,  champions  of the Public Domain and seemingly all-round good
guys,  second  only  in  terms of popularity to Richard Branson's Virgin
empire,  appeared  at  the  Old Bailey today charged with three specimen
counts  of  supplying  false goods under the terms and conditions of the
goods and services act, 1970.

It is alleged that:

[  i] On or about the 5th January 1997, D!crosoft did supply or cause to
      be supplied one (1) Amiga Keyboard Reference Diagram by Terraform
      ASCII productions in The Word under the pretence that it was in fact
      created by D!crosoft.

[ ii] On or about the 5th January 1997, D!crosoft did supply or cause to
      be supplied one (1) PC Mouse Diagram (with installation disk
      diagram) in The Word under the pretence that it was in fact a new
      Amiga 3-Button Mouse diagram (with installation disk diagram).

[iii] On or about the 14th October 1994, D!crosoft did supply or cause
      to be supplied one (1) "Vapourware" Disk-Box diagram under the
      pretence that is was in fact manufactures by D!crosoft, in direct
      breach of "Vapourware's" copyright.

Presiding  over  this case is Judge Jonathon Gerkin, Mr.  Dick Sknom has
chosen to stand for D!crosoft himself, witnesses for the prosecution are
Mr.   B.Block  of  Terraform  ASCII  Productions,  Mr.A.Bolt  of  BoltCo
merchandising, and Ms.V.Ware of Vapourware.

    === Witness Called:  Mr. B.Block, of Terraform ASCII Prods. ===

JG: "Mr.Block, would you please tell the court of your discovery as
    regards to this case, exhibiting all evidence when necessary?"
BB: "Yes, Guv.  We wuz down the car boot sale in Cleggy an' we saw
    this diagram fer sale &lt;holds up Exhibit A - Printout of Amiga
    Keyboard Reference Diagram, published by D!crosoft&gt;, Derek, thats
    me mate, he sez he wants it so we buys it and takes it 'ome like.
    Later we wuz in his attic an' we farnd his knackered one &lt;holds up
    Exhibit B - Old Keyboard Diagram, published by Terraform&gt;, well
    we could see easy that they wuz the same, it we'd wanted a cheapo
    one we'd 'ave got the doc file on how to convert it and bought
    the PC version, cos it's cheaper like."
JG: "Thank you Mr. Block, you may step down."
BB: "Cheers Boss, nail the git will ya?"
JG: "Yes, yes, just sit down, there's a good chap."

    === Witness Called:  Mr. A.Bolt, of Boltco Merchandising. ===

JG: "Mr.Bolt, you have heard the testimony of Mr.B.Block earlier today,
    would you please tell the court of YOUR experiences with regards to
    this case, exhibiting evidence when necessary?"
AB: "Too right, boss!  We wus over in Cleethorpes, like Bootblock was,
    and I saw this ace mag called The Word, we got it like cos I likes
    Amigas and The Word wuz always tops, like.  Anyway we loads it up
    and there, staring us in the face, bold as bloody brass like, it's
    a PeeCee Mouse Diagram, only it's been labelled Amiga cuz it were
    a flop like, most people already had one on the PC already.  I
    remembered cos I'm in the same line, and like you get to know this
    stuff, I knew I'd seen it before."
JG: "You are the expert in your company, are you not, on ASCII design
    and build?  Can you show us the similarities between the two?"
AB: "Sure can, &lt;holds up print-outs of the PC Mouse Diagram and the
    Amiga Mouse Diagram, side by side - Exhibit C&gt; you can see here
    &lt;indicates label on disk diagram&gt; that the ASCII is exactly the
    same, it's just different writing like."

&lt;murmers from public gallery&gt;
JG: ORDER!  ORDER!

AB: "If you look close at the bottom you can see some more writing wot
    'as been added to disguise it."
JG: "Could you read out what it says for us please, the print out is
    rather small and difficult to see from here."
AB: "Er..."
JG: "Is there a problem, Mr.Bolt?"
AB: "I've, er... forgotten me glasses like."

&lt;Mr.Sknom of D!crosoft is seen to hurriedly scribble a note&gt;

JG: "Very well, please step down."

    === Witness Called:  Ms.V.Ware, Vapourware. ===

JG: "Ms.Ware, you also have a grievence against D!crosoft do you not?"
VW: "Indeed your honour, I believe D!crosoft copied a diagram of ours
    in an attempt to pass it off as their own."
JG: "Would you please tell the court how you came to this conclusion?"
FC: "Their diagram wasn't published in any mags, it's obvious to see
    why, because it's hardly any different from ours.  I only went to
    buy one to see what the competition was like, our disk-box diagram
    wasn't selling too well and we though it was due to extra comp-
    etition from D!crosoft."
JG: "Please, outline the similarities between the two diagrams."
VW: "Well, both of them are the same size for one thing, I cou..."

    &lt;Mr.Sknom interjects at this point&gt;
D!: "Objection your honour, all disk boxes are pretty much the same
    size, especially when they are made to carry a round figure like
    100 3½in disks, as these two examples are."

JG: "Objection sustained, please point out highlighting features only
    Ms.Ware."
VW: &lt;under breath&gt; "shit..." &lt;more normally&gt; "Yes Your honour, we also
    noticed that the locking mechanism was similar, and the only
    difference between the two was the D!crosoft logo, which could have
    been added at any time."

JG: === DEFENCE CALLED: Mr. D.Sknom of D!crosoft ===

D!: "I'd like to ask Ms.Ware to stay on the stand if I may..."
    &lt;Ms.Ware sits again.&gt;
D!: "Ms.Ware, may I draw your attention to the locking mechanism of the
    two boxes which you are here about today, in your earlier testimony
    you said, and I quote: `the locking mechanism was similar', is that
    correct?
VW: "Um, yes that's correct."
D!: "You say they are similar, but not exactly the same, yet you are here
    today alledging that D!crosoft copied your design?"
VW: "Well, I guess they could have made a few adjustments."
D!: "Indeed, would you agree that `making a few adjustments' as you put
    it, requires some knowledge of locking mechanism design?  Would you
    say that it requires a lot of knowledge?"
VW: "Yes I'd say that, D!crosoft must have been rather clever to make
    the changes that they did and still use some of the original
    features."
D!: "If then, D!crosoft are this skilled, why should they copy a simple
    locking mechanism, then waste time changing it, when it would no
    doubt be just as easy to make another from scratch?"
VW: "Er..."
D!: "Ms.Ware?  Answer the question please."
JG: "Do you have an answer Ms.Ware?"
VW: "No, not really your honour."
D!: "No Further Questions your honour."
VW: "You may step down Ms.Ware."

JG: === Call the next Witness ===

D!: "Mr. Bolt of BoltCo, please take the stand."
    &lt;A.Bolt takes the stand&gt;
D!: "Mr.Bolt, you alleged earlier that you had left your glasses at home
    and therefore could not read what was written on either the disk or
    the Amiga Mouse Diagram?  Is that correct?"
AB: "Er... yeah, that's right."
D!: "Mr.Bolt, I am handing you a piece of paper &lt;hands Exhibit D to Mr.
    Bolt&gt;, could you tell the court what it says please?
AB: "Er, I ain't got me glasses, I can't see it proper like."
D!: "It's in extra-large-mega-jumbo-print Mr. Bolt."
    &lt;Mr.Bolt makes no reply&gt;
D!: "Can you actually read Mr.Bolt?"
AB: "... ... er.... no, no I can't."

    &lt;exclamations from the public gallery, jury members look
    suprised, Mr.Bolt blushes&gt;
JG: ORDER! ORDER!  I WILL CLEAR THE GALLERY IF I DO NOT HAVE
    SOME SENSE OF ORDER UP THERE!
    &lt;gallery quietens down&gt;

D!: "No Further Questions Your honour."

JG: === Call the Next Witness ===

D!: "Mr.B.Block of Terraform ASCII Productions, please take the stand"
    &lt;Mr.Block wobbles to the stand&gt;
D!: "Mr.Block, would you please tell the court how you would go about
    creating an Keyboard Diagram from scratch?"
BB: "Wot, on me own like?"
D!: "Indeed."
BB: "Er... dunno like, we gets an agency in to do 'em."
D!: "An agency you say?  Would you please tell the court the name of
    this agency, and the name of your contact there?"
BB: "Sure, no prob dude, it's Sacrosoft, my contact's name is Miss.J.
    Powell, she's a reet babe too."
D!: "Your honour, I would like to draw your attention to Exhibit E
    &lt;Mr.Sknom hands a sheet of paper to the Judge&gt;, it is a list of
    Employees at D!crosoft for the last 15 years."
JG: "Indeed, I see."
D!: "Your honour, would you be so kind as to read the name that appears
    seventh in that list, and also the company name that appears second
    in the table under the heading `also trading as:'?"
JG: "The employees name is `J.Powell (miss)', and the company name is
    `Sacrosoft'."

    &lt;uproar in the public gallery, many citizens jeer Mr.Block and
    chant "Bloaters Out!  Bloaters Out!"  Judge Gerkin orders the
    bailiffs to empty the gallery, this takes about 10 minutes as they
    have to talk one member of the public down from the railing&gt;

D!: "I should also like to show the court this advertisement from the
    Times &lt;hands Exhibit F to the jury&gt;, publicly announcing my
    engagement to Ms.Powell.  You will notice that the date of the
    advertisement preceeds Mr.Block's issuing or a writ by just one
    day, and I put it to you, Mr.Block, that your fanciful accusation
    is nothing more than a fit of jealousy!"
BB: "Aargh!  Yer bastard!  I'll fecking have you!"

    &lt;Mr.Block vaults the rail of the dock and attempts to assault
     Mr.Sknom, he is restrained by the bailiffs who handcuff him
     and lead him from the courts&gt;

JG: "Mr.Sknom, it is obvious to all present that you have been the
    victim of a campaign of utter hatred and jealousy.  The court
    apologises profusely.  We fine Mr.Block £1,000 and order him to pay
    £1,000,000 in compensation to D!crosoft, we fine Mr.Bolt £1,000
    and order him to pay £200,000 in compensation to D!crosoft, and
    we also fine Ms.Ware £1,000 and order her to pay £200,000 in com-
    pensation to D!crosoft.  The court hopes that you find this a fair
    and just ruling, case dismissed."

The case against D!crosoft and against Mr.Sknom in particular was in the
end  thrown  out, the judges decision is final and all fines and damages
are to be paid within one month from the date of trial.

Mr.Block  was  subsequently  jailed  for  his attack on Mr.Sknom and was
incarcerated  in  Wormwood Scrubs, he has since escaped by eating a hole
in one of the main walls and is now a fugitive from justice.

Mr.   Bolt  was  ordered to attend reading classes, he found it easy and
painless  and  now reads five books a day minimum.  His company has gone
from  strength  to  strength and now makes monitor, motherboard and even
SIMM diagrams for customers all over the world.  In late May 1997 he was
contracted  to supply diagrams for military spy satellites and now lives
with  his  wife  and  two  children  in  their multi-million pound villa
surrounded by lush tropical forest in Hawaii.

Ms.Ware  married a plumber and now lives in squalour on a run-down inner
city housing estate in London.
