"Like what?"

"Er,Er???"

But come on,are big breasts everything?  Plastic Pamela Anderson started
it all off at the same time as Anna Nicole Smith and now we have Melinda
Messenger,now  Melinda  is nice but the others aren`t but that`s not the
point  here,are we so low as to judge a women on her breasts rather than
her iq?

Yes  it  sounds  a  stupid  article  but  i can`t see the fuss over over
inflated  breasts,yeah  i  love  breasts too but it seems this nation is
obsessed with any girl with a massive pair of hooters.

Just  you  wait  in  another  years  time there will be another model or
ordinary  woman  with  large breasts making headlines and all of us saps
(except me) will fall for the big sell (no pun intended).

Just  as  a  final  note - i prefered Pamela Anderson BEFORE she ahd the
implands  (you know when she was in her teens) and have you also noticed
that the three examples given here are all blondes.

         SHE's got a chest like two peas on an ironing board!
         Obviously Boobs ain't everything! - D!ck]

[Now  either, somehow Dick got hold of this article on it's way to me or
you  typed  this  yourself impersonating D!ck.  However, breasts ARE NOT
everything coz you need a body to go with them!  It's true they do catch
the  eye  (could  ave  yer eye out if not carefull!) but being a leg man
myself,  they  are not everything.  Is there such a thing as the perfect
woman?   I  thought not but then Caprice came along.  I'm practicing how
not to pronounce my "R'rs" right now.  Kei]
