                   By Turd Correspondant, Wayne King.

After a fairly lengthy break from the Amiga scene, everybodies favourite
word  article  type  writing  dude, Andrew Bolt, is back, after recently
discovering that the Word still existed.

In  a  recent interview with Playboy Magazine, Bolt said "I've just been
too  busy  shagging  babes  to  keep  up with events in the Amiga scene.
Sorry"

But  we here at "The Turd" have uncovered the deep, dark secrets beneath
this  improbable  and  rather  pathetic cover story.  We can exclusively
reveal  that  Bolt's  absence  was  caused  by  moving  to Plymouth (AKA
Pasty-land),  doing  excessive  amounts of coursework, and worst of all,
buying a peecee.

But,  Bolt  is now making his long awaited return, after reading TW14 on
an  Amiga Emulator, and masterminding the Word HTML project, in which we
hear he will play the role of Art Editor.

So  watch  out  for  TW16  also  available  in HTML!  From the exclusive
previews we as "Turd" journalists have seen, it should be pretty funky.
