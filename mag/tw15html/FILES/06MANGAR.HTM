 Any  of  you  that  know  me  know  that  I'm  a manga/anime nut with a
collection  fast  approaching 300 titles.  Anyway, here's a quick review
of my fabourite titles.

Title : Ghost In The Shell
Rating: 9/10

 A  cyberpunk  manga  based in the near future.  Large corporations rule
and several companies provide cyborg bodies to everyone and anyone.  The
main  character  is  a female cyborg attached to a special police force.
Her  partner  even  sports  some  special  cyborg lenses as described in
Gibsons Neuromancer!
 A  criminal  known  as  the  Puppet  Master  is erasing both humans and
cyborgs  memories  and replacing them with generated ones so they do not
know who they are only what he wants them to do.  The humans are given a
fake  memory  so  they  live normal lives and are hard to detect.  These
people are known as ghosts, hence ghosts in their shells.
 This  anime  style  is very modern and I look forward to seeing more of
it's  type.   While in London recently I noticed a store had a full size
model  cyborg  of  the  main character in naked form on display in their
window  with  bits  of  flesh  stripped  back  revealing  her servos and
mechanisms and wires protroduing from everywhere.

At present there is no cyberpunk manga that can beat this film.

Title : Megazone 23
Rating: 8/10

 An  area  of land contained within an artificial environment to prevent
outside  contaminants  from  getting  in,  and containg large citties is
known as a megazone.  The story centres around a group of hackers turned
proffesionals  that  are  used  against  other  hackers  known  as  "net
jackers".   They  steal electricity and information by re-routing it and
can  gain  control to most of the cities equipment much to the annoyance
of  the  policing  body.   However  this police force is corrupt and the
newly  recruited  hackers  and  net  jackers  eventually  join forces to
release Eve in order to correct the problem by giving her control of the
central mainframe.

It  gets more complicated than this but to sum it up, it is a modern day
Akira  featuring  hackers  who  want  to  return power to the people and
restore our original way of living.

Title : M.D.Geist
Rating: 7/10

 M.D  meaning  Most  Dangerous,  is  a  Geist.  Geist's are artificially
created  humans  used  in  war.  M.D.Geist however became so violent and
dangerous  that  he  was confined to a geostationary orbitting satellite
prison.   Suspended  in  cryogenics  for  years and forgotten about, his
satellite  accidentally  crashes back down to the plannets surface where
he  is  released.  Challenged by a gang of bandits he kills their leader
by cutting off his arms.  Now with the most powerfull gang behind him he
takes on his former creators and joins his former enemies but he becomes
insane.
 Further  on in the desert another Geist plays god to a colony of humans
protecting him from the human eating robots now plaguing the surrounding
cities.   M.D.Geist  wonders  into  camp and the ruling Geist challenges
him.
 This  is  where  I  started  loosing  the  thread  of the story because
M.D.Geist is portrayed as evil and the other Geist as good but M.D.Geist
is invincible.

Title : Cyber City ODEO 808 File 1 : Virtual Death
Rating: 8/10

 The  sound  track  to  this is great!  Three criminals are sentenced to
life  sentences in prison but are offered a deal.  For every job they do
for  the  company  they  get time taken off their sentences.  However it
will  take  an  enormos amount of tasks to erase the sentences completly
and if they die in the process, the company looses nothing.
 There  are  3  files  to  this  series  each  based around one of the 3
characters.  The first one is my favourite as it is more cyberpunk.  The
second is about hacking and the third, vampyres.

Title : AD Police Episodes 1-3
Rating: 8/10

 I'm  a  big  fan  of  Bubblegum  Crisis and when I heard this was based
around this I had to check it out.  However it is based on the character
Leon in BGC and is set before BGC which is weird because in BGC, Leon is
a bit of a wanker but in this he's a tough bastard.
 It's  a  bit  like  Dominion  Tank  Police  in  style but it has a more
cyberpunk  edge  to  it  especially  if  you used to read the old 2000AD
comics  like  I  did.   BTW, does anyone know what will happen to 2000AD
comics in the year 2000 which is getting nearer?

Rating: 7/10

 There  are so many Ranma titles out there.  It's popular in Japan.  The
basic  storyline is a father and son are cursed by an old hag.  Whenever
the  father gets wet he turns into a giant panda.  Whenever the son gets

Title : Riding Bean
Rating: 7/10

 Bean  and team are for hire to anyone requiring their services.  Framed
for  a  crime  they  did  not commit they must clear their names.  I had
never  seen  this  title  before but from what I can gather, Bean is not
human seen as how bullets don't seem to hurt him.  Just a guess.

Title : Silent Mobius
Rating: 7/10

 A very weird set of films based around the concept that ESP exists.  In
the  future  a  cop department known as AMD recruits girls with high ESP
levels  to  help  protect the world from the demon dimension.  It's very
cutesy and romantic at times and you can't help but get the feeling that
it  was  created by people with no life and girlfriends but it's graphic
style  outways any fears of it being too crap.  Plus the storyline is so
entwined  and  deep  that you'd probably spend most of your time working
out who is who.

Title : Tenchi Muyo
Rating: 9/10

 One  of  my  favourite comedy mangas.  There are 2 storylines to Tenchi
depending  on  whether  you are watching the films or series.  The films
are  available  in  the  UK  as  tapes with 2 titles on each and in them
Tenchi  accidentally  frees  a demon who falls in love with him.  In the
series however he does not free the demon, she comes to see him.
 Tenchi  is hilarious and a most for any manga enthusiast.  Tenchi is in
the middle of a love triangle where the girls want his body and he wants
out.   The  cute  graphics and humour will make you laugh unless you get
the subtitled versions, read fast and you should still laugh though!

Title : Uresei Yatsura (aka: Lum)
Rating: 6/10

 The  main  character is girl crazy except when it comes to Lum.  Lum is
crazy  about  settling  down  with  her  "darling"  but he's crazy about
anything  that  goes  by in a skirt.  This is a weird long winded comedy
with   weird  characters.   For  instance  the  postman  looks  like  an
over-weight penguin on a push bike!
