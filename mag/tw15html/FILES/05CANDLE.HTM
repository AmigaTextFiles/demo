                              By Fireball


Ok  guys - these are made by me for Medieval Re-Enactment purposes, they
cost  slightly  more than parafin wax, but it's a choice of tallow which
is  for  the lower classes, doesn't smell nice, is very smoky, burns too
quick  and  melts in the sun.  The other choice is beeswax candles which
are for the richer classes, such as merchants, captains and the clergy..
They  burn slowly, drip less, smell much better, don't melt in the sun..
I make 4 sizes:-

Small :         1.5cm  ø by 14 cm High            Lanterns
Medium:         2.0cm  ø by 22 cm High            Tables
Large :         3.5cm  ø by 29 cm High            Clergy
Extra Large:    10.0cm ø by 10 cm High            Floor burning

There  is  some variation on these, depending on the heat of the wax, my
patience, etc...


Utensils:

Old chip pan:        To melt the wax in.
Dipping tube:        To dip the candles into.
Dipping jigs:        Optional - lets you dip upto 8 candles at once
                     instead of just 2.
Hemp Thread :        For a wick which is authentic for most periods and
                     burns straight, if you want it to flop over - buy
                     some wick from a candle shop.
Burco Boiler:        Keeps the wax in the dipping tube molten at the
                     correct temperature.
Silicon Spray:       If you want to use any sort of moulds, then use
                     the spray to allow easy release of the mould!
Sharp Knife/Scalpel: To cut the ends of the candle flat for putting
                     into a candle holder or for burning on a flat
                     surface.
Gas Burner:          To heat the knife to allow it to melt thru the
                     wax, if you try to use a cold knife you will
                     shatter the base of the caandle.

Some people like to roll their candles to make them look nice and smooth
it's  a  waste  of  time, don't use paper to pack them with as the paper
sticks.
