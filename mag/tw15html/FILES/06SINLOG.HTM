<font color =#4C4CC4>
Every  week  I  visit  the local pre recorded compact disc music vending
establishments  (Virgin  and  HMV)  to  scab as many stlg1.99 singles as
possible.   I  don't  care  to  much  what's on them.  I just seem to be
collecting them.

Here is my log from the past few weeks:

<font color =#4C5858>Reverence/Faithless
===================
<font color =#4C4CC4>Dreary  hip hoppy thing.  Nice bass though.  But of course I bought this
for the remixes of Insomnia.  Cool!

<font color =#4C5858>Block Rockin' Beats/Chemical Brothers
=====================================
<font color =#4C4CC4>Only 3 tracks :( Tight arsed cunts. But they are good!

<font color =#4C5858>Spybreak!/Propellerheads
========================
<font color =#4C4CC4>Not  bad,  didn't  have the track I wanted on it though (from the adidas
trainer advert) The second track is weird.

<font color =#4C5858>You're Not Alone/Olive
======================
<font color =#4C4CC4>Had to get this one I'm afraid.  6 tracks lasting over 40 minutes of the
same  song.  If you aren't already sick of this song, this should do the
job.  Some nice jungly mixes though.

<font color =#4C5858>The Prophet/CJ Bolland
======================
<font color =#4C4CC4>Another tight arser with just 3 tracks.  Okay tune but the bass distorts
on just about any hifi.

<font color =#4C5858>Asylum/Orb
==========
<font color =#4C4CC4>Cacky dreary ambientish thing. Yawn.

<font color =#4C5858>Amour (c'mon)/Porn Kings
========================
<font color =#4C4CC4>7 tracks! But they're all identical and not a patch on "Up To No Good"
