                    Oh Jenny Powell, our Jen,             .        
          .    .  Oh when will I see you again?              .  
         .                                                        
                    You passed me in the street today,     .  *    
       .   |    .   And took my baited breath away,                
          -*-       You looked so fine that winter morn,    .   .  
           |    .   My arm I wish you would adorn,                 
        .                                                 *    .   
             .   .  My love for thee I do declare,                 
        .           To run my fingers through your hair,       |   
           .   *    To hold you close throughout the night,   -*-  
                 .  and kiss you, t'would be my delight,       |  .
       .    .                                                      
                .   Your skin like chocolate, so smooth,      *   
         *  .       Sends shivers through me when you move,       .
              .  .  Your smile like sunshine after rain,       .   
                    Will you not light my life again?       .     .
