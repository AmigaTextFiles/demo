An   entry   into   the  World-Wide  Wibble'97  competition.   An  Email
conversation  between  two  guys  who, out of concern for their right to
walk freely among the sane, we'll call "D" and "P"...

The Adventure begins....

D&gt;  I've  been receiving blank E-Mail from Blank@Blank.blank.uk, and the
time/date  on them is:  31/12/69 16:00.  Mucho Bizarro!  Is someone lost
in  time and trying to contact me across the years by means of a cunning
method  of  electrical communication called - gasp - E-Mail!  Maybe it's
me?   Maybe I go back in time and try to communicate with myself but the
paradox means that the actual content of the mail doesn't reach me, as I
never typed it, because I never went back in time, er...  oh blimey.

P&gt;  I  have the answer, Its obviously the work of Terry Wogan.  Way back
in  1969,  on  the eve of decimalization, before the Floral Dance killed
millions,  he  hatched  a  plan  to  inflict  Blankety-Blank  on  the UK
populace.   Using some kind of time-space bathtub-disintigrator he tried
to  send  his idea into the past so he'd reap the rewards in the future.
His  evil  mind rays must have took a deflection off a hippy commune and
hit your Email box...

D&gt;  The  emerald  one  is  it?  By crimminy I *knew* there was something
fishy  about  the  way  he was so popular despite being so crap!  I have
since  realised  that the Eurovision Song Contest is in fact a front for
his  mind-  manipulation  experiments, the sole objective is to turn the
minds of the nation into cream cheese from the inside out...

P&gt;  Its  him  for sure, just look at that implausible wig straddling his
expanded  cranium,  its  as  phoney  as Johnny Morris's supposed love of
animals.   Animal  Magic:   My arse..  Under that unfeasible thatch lies
the  key  to  his  power.   For  what  poses as flesh and bone is really
high-octane  alien  glop, with perhaps a few supermarket trollies thrown
in.  The Song Contest?  A cheesier production I cant imagine.

D&gt;  Case  solved!   Crack  this  one:   Someone  called me at 03:37 this
morning, know anything about it?  Maybe it's aliens checking to see if I
was  in  before  they  come  to  kidnap  me?   It's  save on petr...  on
dueterium wouldn't it?  Maybe they were calling from America which would
explain  the  weird  time?   Your  views  on  this  theory would be much
appreciated...

P&gt;  Hmm..   This  would  appear  to  be the work of our old enemies, the
Gangly-dragons.  These spectral manifestations of corrupted java-scripts
have  been  known  to send their electrical tendrils down phone lines in
order  to  suck  intelligence  directly out of the minds of unsuspecting
people-using-the-phone-type-situation.  Victims can be easily identified
by  their  tendancy  to  buy  Spice  Girls records.  A narrow escape for
sure..

D&gt;  Crivens!  I rushed into town on receiving this message and purchased
an anti-spectral-manifestation kit from Argos, it cost me just 29.99 and
comprises  one  (1) pack of crisps, one (1) can of coke and one (1) copy
of   Little  Computer  People  for  the  Stylophone  (from  Rolpheroo!),
apparently  you  gorge  on the consumables and play the style-fingy down
the phone at any alien-invader-types, perchance...

P&gt;  Yes  indeed.   Foolishly, I recently sold my Stylophone.  Well OK, I
didnt have the actual artical but my Sportster 14.4 modem was doing such
a  good job of masquerading as one that I thought it'd fool the aliens..
It  must have worked cus I havent been attacked by any ionically charged
filaments of plasma as yet..

Hmm...   Was  the Coke you bought was of the diet variety?  Sugar in the
blood  decreases  the  skin  resistance making a random hit from such an
electrostatic  fibrous  tenticle more likely.  After all, you are now "A
chosen  fruit".  Its a classic Is-there-a-boil-on-the-face-of-Mars plot-
type-PP9-conspiracy..

D&gt;  Indeed  it  was  sire,  verily, verility?  Er...  Anyway it has been
proven  as  per  your estemed communication or 35-past-midnight that the
CO2-laced  soft  fruit  extract  of  the type "Normal" does indeed lower
resistance  to  electro-chemical  waves,  such  as  those  generated  by
alien-invader-types.

P&gt;  Those  crisps!   I hope they were of the Smokey Bacon variety??  The
bilious  nature  of  the  smokey-bacon  types  is sufficient to stop any
gestating alien taking root in the gut..

D&gt;  Negative  captain,  while Smokey-Bacon type crisped potatoes are all
very  well  for  those  programmer  types,  we HTML people are forced to
managed  on  low-grade  Di-cheesenonion types, they are created by using
the  same  raw materials however, just modified in a different way, that
is all, paragraph ends..

P&gt;  Anyway,  Argos was a good choice of shopping emporium.  Madness once
sang;  "Argos,  in  the  middle of our steet", subliminaly implying that
actual  madness  could  be  avoided ("In the middle of our street" being
analogous  to normality) by purchasing goods from Argos..  Perhaps these
ageing  funsters had some insight into the activities of the gangly ones
in the murk of the past...

I confess, the copy of Little Computer People has me puzzled, I'd always
believed  these  so-called  nodes  of  artificial  intelligence were the
devil's  spores.   Perhaps  the  horned one doesnt like damn alien trash
muscling  in  on  his  patch and so has reprogrammed his minions (in the
special edition) to fight the alien intruder within...

D&gt;  Unlikely, but it strikes me that the layout of the Argos store is no
mistake,  careful  examination of the correllation of the shelves to the
customer routes indicates that it was created by a higher intelligence -
The  Co-op  of  legend  -  who in their quest for perfection, modified a
transporter  and charged it to wander the multiverse supplying the right
thing at the right time, perhaps a sympathetic fate?

P&gt;  Yes indeed!  Placing subliminal shop-tastic messages at right angles
to  the  plane  of  the  ecliptic can only have an adverse affect on the
minds of shoppers nationwide."Buy spoons", it'll have printed in reverse
in  micro-dots  on  the  back  of fabric softener bottles..  "Pledge you
alledgiance"  the spoons will mutter..  "Thomas the Tank Engine is EVIL"
hiss  the corn-plasters.  It sounds like a hideous nightmare, but Thomas
really  does  seem  to  have  a  sinister  agenda,  just listen to those
pulse-width modulated Peep-peeps - Alien comms for sure..

D&gt;  Last  weeks  shopping  trip  ended in disaster when a group of irate
chinese  exchange students barged in shouting "This is Yoshi, we have NO
fax,  nothing!" and waving chopsticks in the faces of the serving staff.
Such  was  the  disruption  that we were forced to evacuate on a passing
Cadburys  Mini-Egg  and  make  good our escape over the road to the safe
haven of Tesco, where we did gorge on prawns dipped in salad cream, with
bakewell tart for afters.

P&gt;  A  prime  example  of  the  ingenuitiy  of  The Yellow Peril Freedom
Fighters.   Word is they were attempting to counter the subversive alien
influences  of  the  recent  "Not  Chopsticks!   Spooooons!" Ambrosia TV
commericial.   The  YPFF  are of course best remembered for thwarting an
attack  of demonically possessed wheelbarrows during the great allotment
wars  of  '95.   Topographical  maps  of  John  Noakes' forehead and the
spectral  analysis  of  a  penguin  were  used to create an atomic super
turnip.   When  this  quantum  veg  was  rolled  down  a nearby hill, it
neutralized  the  'barrows  on contact.  A small blast crator of several
hundred square miles was the only collateral damage..

D&gt; The YPFF today issued a statement to clarify a misunderstanding which
has seen citizens up and down the country attempting to force persons of
oriental  origin  into  Post  Boxes.  On a recent round of "It's a Knock
Out"  a  member of the YPFF was heard to yell "Olinge, masta?", and then
started  to sing the national anthem as applicable to vegetables and all
herring no more than 3 inches in length.

P&gt;  This  seemed  irrelevant  wibble until the National Alien Discoverer
Society  found  that the directors of the UK's sole food canning company
had  been  replaced  by  androids  (Alien Electronics Co.  Models 27.5).
Suspicions  were  aroused  when these dopplegangers started partaking in
tasks  other than creaming off company profits into their bank accounts.
The  plot  was to secretly contaminate food stuffs with alien DNA at the
canning  stage..   Fortunately  N.A.D.S  discovered  that this alien goo
could  be  de-activated  by distorted vocal oscillations.  The YPFF were
tipped  off and acted with amazing improvisation at the "Its a Knock Out
Special" just before tea time.

D&gt;  Many viewers rang to complain about the scenes of degradation as the
contenders chomped away on the contents of a crate marked "Outspan", but
realised  they had got the wrong number when an irate voice at the other
end of the phone yelled "You wan' flied lice?".

P&gt; "We dont expect programs to be unrealistic", said a woman at the ITC,
"but  efforts  to  save the human race must be justified and shown at an
appropiate  time".   Meanwhile,  the  aliens  were spotted slinking away
cursing and vowing revenge..

D&gt; It has since been discovered that the canning company at the heart of
the  alien  conspiracy  had  itself  been  replaced with a clone without
anyone  noticing.  The only clue to the change was the alien's inability
to  produce  a perfectly cylindrical soft drink can, instead the mistake
was made of shaping them to fit the snout of natural-shap Kung, an alien
race  responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent Tamagotchi via
carefully  calculated  chip  replacements.  It is well knows in NipponCo
circles   that  the  Virtual  Pet  is  capable  of  receiving  microwave
transmissions  if  the  chip  is  shorted using a piece of pocket fluff.
Messages  along  the  lines of "You're worthless, you are nothing, if an
amoeba  had  an  opinion it would think you worthy of nothing" have been
decoded by vigilant bus conductors.

P&gt; Not surprising as these are some of the best agents.  In fact, such a
grease-ball  single handedly foiled the famous "Mr Kiplings Anti-Gravity
Cakes"  scam in the 70's by simply shouting "I'll get you Butler!" which
happened  to  be  the  abort  code  to world domination.  The alien plot
centred  around  removing  the  human  population  of  Earth by means of
dark-matter cherry-slices.  Our Blakey was alerted when a swarm of apple
turnovers  escaped from the local branch of the Salvation Army at a flag
day.   Afterwards, several of the ladies quietly admitted to having been
concerned about the sudden low molecular density of their tambourines..

D&gt;  Today  saw renewed scenes of violence in downtown Cleethorpes when a
so-called "Virtual Pet", started transmitting a series of coded messages
seemingly  made  up  at  random  from  the  words "Kill" and "Them" in a
bizarre   X-Files   style   attempt  to  take  control  of  it's  owner.
Unfortunately  for  the  YPFF  who executed the painstaking operation to
hack into Tamagotchi Central, the owner of the pet simply returned it to
the  store  where he bought it, complete with the original packaging and
his  receipt,  and  got  another  one.   This led to a battle of immense
proportions  in  the  rejects  and  returns  room at "Toys R' Us" as the
occupants tried to destroy each other.

P&gt;  If  evidence be needed of the aliens capability to turn the minds of
our  youth  into  mush  then  surely  this  is it.  These evil toys are,
according  to  Herr  Hans  Von  Vankling of the Frankfurt Alien Research
Trust,  designed  to  make kids more accomodating to strange life forms.
The  next  stage  of  the alien plot is thought to involve a device that
encourages  bizarre  acts  of  body piercing (evidently, trial runs have
already been in progress).  Eventually it'll be perfectly acceptable for
humans  to  implant  alien critters into their bellies and tend to their
every need..
 
D&gt;  The Tamagotchi usually dies from a fused chip, more commonly known
as "broken heart", and this occurrs no matter how well cared for the pet
is..   Of course it only dies until the user presses the reset button on
the  back,  then  another spirit takes up residence and starts receiving
those messages...

P&gt;  It can only further re-inforce the aliens evil mind-model.  "Life is
cheap,  just  press  a  button  for  instant resurrection, pops" is what
they're drumming into our youth.  This way they hope they wont react too
badly when their war machines finally arrive from Neo-Taiwan in the Vega
Nubula..   Word has it that their previous artillery got mixed up with a
shipment  of  out-of-date Kinder Surprise Eggs and so never made it past
customs...

D&gt;  It has recently emerged that more people than ever before were under
the thrall of the alien invaders when tests revealed that, as previously
expected,  the Rubik's Cube and Rubik's Revenge ware botched attempts to
subdue  the  population by turning their brains to lard.  It was said at
the  time  that  "These  things  are the toys of Satan", SATAN of course
being  an acronym for "Subversive And Tactical Alien Nation", a division
of Microsoft.  Only around 20% of the population who actually bought the
cube  were  affected  though, despite additional efforts through an even
more influential book, entitled "You can do the cube".

P&gt;  So  Patrick  Bossert  was  an  alien  spy  after all!  I knew he was
snivvling  little  shit at the time, sat there with his BBC model B, and
bluffing  us  all  with  his,  "I  broke my leg in a skiing accident and
started  cracking the cube instead" lies!  I actually bought that book -
no  wonder  I  found  it  completely  useless;  it  was just a series of
encrypted  instructions  to  make  the patterns on the cube required for
SATAN  to  enter  the  mind.   Fortunately,  mine was one of those fruit
labelled  cubes  so I had a narrow escape, even though my ears did morph
into bananas at one stage.

D&gt;  The government recently announced a scheme to treat 250,000 affected
citizens  using  a  new  "Back  to  Work" drug...  In the United States,
scientists  have  discovered another symptom of infection, a wide gaping
of  the  mouth  and  clenching  of  teeth  known  as "Phony Smilieitis".
Mr.Blair  and  his USA counterpart Jack Nicholson are said to be looking
into the matter...

P&gt;  I  believe  the  government  is  already  under the influence of our
invaders-from-the-cosmos.   A  goverment  that  cracks  down  on  greedy
directors  is  just  so  strange and novel..  There must be summat going
on....
 
D&gt;  I've discovered the source of the phone call.  It wasnt aliens after
all,  It was someone calling a wrong number!  The same guy called at 7pm
(a decent hour!) and it turns out he'd dialled one up from me, I put him
straignt anyway (whaddafeck was he doing up at 3:37 anyway?)

P&gt;  I  wouldnt discount the alien menace though, the recent reports of a
toe nail massacre in Chipping Sodbury and stories of imploding kebabs in
Fishbourne  can  only  mean  that,  once again, the aliens have released
their  wirey-arms-of-pure-energy-stuff.  Why, only yesterday, a man with
a beard played a trumpet.
