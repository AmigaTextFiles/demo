<font color =#70584C>
I've  just read an article by Battle Angel about what's on his desk.  At
first  I  figured  "this  guy  has too much time on his hands" buy as we
allow  the  reader  to  write  ANYTHING they wish, why not "What's on my
desk?".   So I took a look at my own (messy) desk which is an executives
desk  I  got in a furniture sale for £69.  One of those long, wide desks
with  drawers  and loads of leg room underneath.  So in the hope I don't
set a new trend in desk reviews:

A1200 - This has no trapdoor and a piece of cardboard underneath to stop
the  accelerator  card  from burning the top of the desk.  First time it
was  fitted it blew the clock clean off the board and made a nick in the
top  of  the  desk.   The  casing  looks a bit dented as well due to the
rather  large  Samsung  560MB  3.5"  HD  slap  bang in the middle of it.
There's  a  rather  "Speedball 2" damaged Quickshot II joystick attached
and  a  free  Amiga mouse from Amiga technologies.  The printer is under
the  desk  and is an old Epson MX-80 F/T III which I took it upon myself
to  spray  bright  red.   There  is  a  ceramic  plate mounted above the
DEL/HELP keys which says "KEI" curtorsey of a contact.

SVGA  eLoneX  monitor  -  purchased  legally  from  a  local hospital by
donating  £50  to  the  hospital charity.  It is attached to the 486DX/2
80MHz PC under the desk and proclaims it belongs to the Diabetes ward.

Compaq  Contura  486DX/2  25MHz  laptop  - sits nicely on the end of the
desk.   Has  multiple  ports (inc.  docking bay) and lasts several hours
without mains power.

Misc  computer  hardware  - I seem to accumulate hardware without really
trying.   I  like playing around with the stuff in order to see if I can
get  it  to work (if broke) or to do something it wasn't really intended
to  do.   Maybe  I should start a second-hand hardware swap shop through
the Word?  I wouldn't mind some external PC keyboards (Cherry?) so I can
spray them in misc colours.  I seem to have loads of joysticks (only one
now works), adaptors, cables and connectors lying around.

Motorola  8500X  -  Batteries  dead  at  present  but it just sits there
listening   to  people  making  calls  on  analogue  Vodaphone-connected
cellphones.  Pretty boring really hence dead battery.

Realistic  Pro-43 Scanner - Ditto except you can listen to taxi drivers,
aeroplanes and for some reason, pizza delivery boys.

Pile  of  jiffies  -  These  are  the  ones  with Word articles that I'm
currently  compiling  for  this issue.  I'm balancing them on top of the
eLoneX monitor at present due to lack of space.

Talking  Clock  -  One of those female ones that tells you the time when
the  alarm was set to go off.  "seven-ay-em,seven-ay-em,seven-ay-em...."
stops after one minute or when you hit it.  Latter usually happens.

One of those dune thingies - it's broke.  air got in it somehow and some
of  the  water  is missing but I never saw it leak out.  Currently looks
like a snakes head.

Floppy  disks  - They breed.  I needed some HD floppies at one point and
now  I  have a drawer full of em.  They all say "Peter Pan by Electronic
Arts"  on  them.   Anyone got any spare disk labels?  I'll send you some
jiffy junk in return!  ;)

Bits  of  paper  -  ideas  for  Word  articles, instructions for article
formatting  (gone  yellow),  D&amp;D  images  stuck  all over with blue-tak,
post-it reminders which I've forgotten about.

Print-outs  -  Nice  manga  pictures  done with a contacts 720dpi Cannon
printer  and  examples  of  how  not to print JPGS on a 9pin dot matrix.
(Tip:   Don't  do this at 1am as it annoys the parents coz 9pins are not
known for their quietness!).

Pens  -  people  leave  them  lying around and they seem to end up on my
desk.  Strange that.  Biro abductions maybe?

Code  printouts  -  real-time, pascal, C++ source code dumps on A3 paper
whose reverse side has been recycled into a jot pad by yours truely.

Keys  -  for disk boxes.  Ever noticed how one set opens every other box
made in the world?  Strange that. Reminds me of Mini's.

Organizer - my phone book, scheduler and memo all in one.

SKY TV Guide - Essential if you want to know what's on satellite as long
as it's not on Eurosport, TNT and all the late night channels.

Amstrad  SRD400  - Sitting on the end of me desk at present.  Got it for
£20 to take to Ipswich.  Had it modified.

Stamps  -  Essential  for  any  trader.   I hung up my glue gun ages ago
though.

Elastic  Bands  -  Never one when you need one but always there when you
don't.

Mouse mats - got loads of these. Must go to shows more often.

Stereo headphones - essential for late-night channel hopping.

Phone - Where would I be without my phone?

Opium scented candles - so I can type weird articles at 2am.


As  for the rest of the room, there's Rodney Matthews posters everywhere
and a big map of the world showing all the places I've never been.
