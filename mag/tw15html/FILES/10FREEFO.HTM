      ===========================================================
      WARNING!   This  is for informational purposes only, do not
      be  a  bugger and muck BT about by nicking free phone calls
      because they will not appreciate it in the slightest, it is
      illegal,  blah  blah  blah,  so  don't do it, you have been
      told, etc etc etc, har bloody har...
      ===========================================================
      Having said that,  BT make £100 a second, so *I* won't call
      you any names if you decide to do something naughty.  :)
      ===========================================================

Right,  BT,  shitheads the lot of 'em yeah?  Go down the street and look
for  a  mk2  kiosk,  the  all-glass booths with the reddish-purple flash
across  the  top, if it reads "Coins" then you're part there, ignore any
that  read  "Coins  &amp; Cards" as they are mk3, ignore "Cards" for reasons
that will become apparent.

Examine  the  fone,  it  should  be old LCD display with the really tiny
characters,  in  the  silver case, *NOT* the multi-lingual creamy colour
fones, these will not work, the fone also has the up/down volume just to
the LEFT of the number pad, this is the fone you want.

Take a 10p to test it with, put the 10p in, and dial:

When the message "No Coin Calls" appears, keep hitting 0 until your coin
drops out again, six or seven taps is usually enough.  If you didn't get
your  coin back, hang up to get your coin and look for another fone, cos
this one don't work...

If it is the right kind, hang up, pocket your 10p and start again with a
£1  coin.  Make your call as normal, but BEFORE you get down to the last
10p,  press  "Follow-on-Call", wait for the dialling tone, and enter the
magic number again.  Wait for the "No Coin Calls" message again, and hit
the zero key a few times to get your dosh back.

Repeat until bored...   8^)

This  really  works, I have seen it done with mine own eyes, now all you
need  is a laptop and an acoustic coupler and you can play around on the
Internet for free...  :)
