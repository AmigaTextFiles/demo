TO: "The Amiga Kid"
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

While  I  was  listening  to Cool FM (107.6) here in Grimsby, the DJ was
getting messages from people on a CB, in which where someone called "The
Amiga  Kid"  (I  think yer real name is Adrian?) had a greet to someone.
Who are you, Mr Kid?

Oh yeh, me sister knows the main DJ at Cool FM ....


TO: Dave Diamond
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

I  decided  not  to  make this into a fully-fledged article, and instead
make it as a messie.

Okay  Dave, the reason why crackers only put CD32 onto disk (so they can
be  used  on an A1200) and not PeeCee games like Day Of The Tenticle, is
because PeeCee games aren't compatible with the Amiga range of pooters.

That's because the CPU in the Amiga and the PeeCee are totally different
and therefore can't interprete the code.

Say  for  example,  you  and  a  Chinese  bloke had to work on something
together, lets say, fixing a car.  The Chinese bloke knows how to fix it
but  you  don't.   So  he has to tell you, but he can't because you only
speak  English  &amp; he only speaks Chinese.  Therefore you don't know what
he's saying so you can't do it.  Hopefully that was clear.

The  CPU  only  speaks one language, so you're gonna need an interpreter
(ie.   software  emulation) to translate.  But the problem with this is,
that it's so painfully slow.

Hmmm...   pretty  good explantion, init?  And I made it all up as I went
along....  god I'm so good ....
