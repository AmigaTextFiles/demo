  Item : Internal, software-based ISA modem card.
  Price: 94.00 inc VAT, no delivery.
  From : Output Computers, Grimsby.
         (01472 311777)
  Warr : 5-yr USR Warranty

Everyone  knows US Robotics, they are second only to Hayes when it comes
to  modems of quality, and if you've had anything to do with modems just
recently  then  you'll  have  heard  of  x2 technology, a protocol being
pushed by USR to facilitate internet downloading at 56.6 kilobaud, twice
the speed of 28.8 modems in common use today.

Four  of the USR models can be upgraded to x2, but only two of these can
be done via software, the Sportster Flash and the Sportster Winmodem.  I
visited Output Computer Repairs in Grimsby with the intention of getting
some  info  on  the  AMD  K6  processor  - another story - and noticed a
WinModem  sat  on the shelf.  A few enquiries to the price and it turned
out that I could get it for much the same price as mail order would cost
with Delivery on top.

A  detailed  technical  discussion  followed  regarding  CPU  drain  and
upgradability,  the  WinModem  differs  from the Sportster Flash and all
other external modems because the sending and compression is not done by
chips on the card, but by software, which means your processor will have
extra  work to do.  The general concensus was that my P133 would have no
trouble  at  all,  certainly  Output  have  sold several and never had a
complaint yet.

I  parted with my wad of cash and took the modem home, a squint into the
box  while  on  the bus revealed a pile of literature, several CDs and -
phew!   -  a  modem-to-phone  cable, not all manufacturers include these
with  their  modems,  I was feeling down, as one does when large sums of
money  have just passed away, and so was in no mood to spend another two
quid on a cable.

I  got  home  and emptied the box, and found that a lot of the stuff was
CDs  and junk mail for internet services, so I could ignore them, though
people  looking  to  join  up  could  do a lot worse than use the Virgin
Internet Trial CD included with the modem.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>How d'you fit it then?</CENTER></FONT></B>



First  of  all,  uninstall  any  other modems you might have, remove all
settings  and software and physically remove the modem and pack it away.
I got shut of Sacko's Psion Surfer - hurrah!  - pile of poo that it is.

As  it's  an  internal  modem  it's  going to take up an interrupt, so I
disabled  COM2,  where  my  old  modem was, and used that for the modem,
you'll  find the software sets itself up quite nicely so there's no need
to panic, but I turned off COM2 in my BIOS before proceeding.

Next, unplug everything and open up your PC, it's a good idea to have it
plugged  into  the  mains  (but  switched  OFF at the socket) to prevent
electrostatic discharges building up.  Find a vacant ISA slot and remove
the cover from the back of the machine.

Here's  where  your  first  problem might arise:  The modem card is very
long  and overran the end of my ISA slots by a good half inch or so.  On
the  first  slot  I  tried  it  in  this  meant that the end of the card
wouldn't  go  in because the CPU fan was in the way - doh!  I then tried
the  next  slot  down,  and  found  that  the  CD-Audio  connector on my
soundcard  protruded  out  too  far  towards  the neighbouring slot, and
pushed hard against the modem card - double doh!!

In  the  end  I  simply bent the CD-Audio connector out of the way, this
meant  it  jutted  out less and while it still touches the modem card, I
can  at  least  get  the  card in and it's only touching the big plastic
housing on the modem anyway.

If you've disabled COM2 you might like to pysically remove the port from
your  machine  like  it  did.   You  won't be using it for anything else
anyway, not even null-modem games (get a network card!).

Right, it's in (phew!), plug everything back in (but leave the cover off
just  in case) and switch it all on.  The machine boots up as per usual,
only  now the Plus &amp; Pray BIOS detects *two* cards, network and - hurrah
-  US Robotics 33,600 Winmodem!  So far so good!  Windows 95 detects new
hardware  and automatically starts searching for the drivers for it, all
standard  stuff, and less than 10 minutes after switching it on I've got
it set up and working, the installation is just superb.

So  what's  it  like?   My  mail program is none-standard and so the old
Psion  didn't  like  it  AT  ALL, but the USR just whips my mail off the
server like there's no tomorrow, this thing is fast!

I  tried it on the internet, and again, it rips the code down that phone
line,  twice  out  of  four attempts I got on at full 33,600.  At my old
place,  and  using  a  normal  Sportster, we'd never got on above 28,800
before, the WinModem is *much* faster.

As  for the CPU worries, there are none, nothing has happened to make me
wonder  if  getting  a  software  modem  was a wise decision, it has all
performed  perfectly, even calls to the local BBS connect at 33,600 with
no  hassles,  it's all working as you'd expect from a company such as US
Robotics.   I'm  in  the habit of running two or three browsers at once,
plus Notepad, and I've had no trouble whatsoever.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>The x2 Upgrade</CENTER></FONT></B>



At the time of writing the x2 upgrade is not available for this modem, I
keep  visiting the UK site (you need the version for the UK phone system
you see) at www.usr.co.uk but so far the patch is not there, just a nice
picture  of  my  modem  card  and  the text "upgrade coming soon".  Both
Phil!97  and  Video  have upgraded the Sportster Flash to x2 and tell me
the  procedure is relatively painless, and I see no reason why upgrading
this one should be any different.

Half  the  time  though,  you will not get on at 55,600 anyway.  When we
tried  the  Sportster  Flash  at  my  house the fastest we got on at was
around  45,000  but  this  is still much faster than your normal 33,600.
Pictures  and  thumbnails  appear  much  quicker,  pages come down a lot
quicker, everything is much better all round.

Note that x2 is only a one-way system, you can still only send at 33,600
but  you  download at the faster rate.  This is because the modem is not
equipped  to  send  at  these  speeds,  to  do  so you must be connected
directly  to  the  digital  phone network.  This is what is happening at
your ISP's switching station.  Pipex, who we tested the modem with, have
set  up a dedicated x2 number for you to dial:  0645 336576, just change
your dial-up connection and that's it.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>All in all then...</CENTER></FONT></B>



What  a  modem,  it's great, and when he x2 upgrade becomes available it
promises to be even better.  You can get it mail order for much the same
price  as I did, I simply bought it from Output because I was there, and
they've always helped with problems, they're just down the road too.

    Value: 9/10 - Good price for what you get, 33,600 modems
                  still cost around this amount and they're
                  not all upgradable.

    Installation: 8/10 - The card is a bit long and you might
                         have to choose your slot with care. 

    Ease of use: 10/10 - Just like any other modem, piece of
                         cake really!

    Speed: 10/10 - Or rather, it will be when it's upgraded!

    Features: 10/10 - Does everything, voicemail, fax, data,
                      you even get a dinky little microphone
                      for the voice software, it's so cool.

    Support: 10/10 - BBS and web support, E-Mail, plenty of
                     free internet offers, 5-yr warranty, can
                     you think of anything else you'd need?

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Overall 10/10</CENTER></FONT></B>


I really cannot see any reason why you should buy any other modem!

[I'd  like to hear from anyone with x2 modems about how it is performing
on  downloads.   With the current state of the UK's analogue connections
it  is  not  possible  to get anywhere near 56k/s on download unless you
have  a  dedicated ISDN/T1/T2/T3 line to your house.  You are looking at
46.6k at the most or 53k if a fibre optic connnection.  At present I get
107k/s  but  only at uni.  I'll have access to the above lines in my new
job  so  expect  some  performance tests from me in future issues of The
Word.  Kei]
