 Well  I've  spent me sunday editing Word articles and shoving in colour
codes  and  the  thing's  almost  complete now, only the HD installer to
write, icons to do, loading ascii to alter and disk compression to test.
Then  there's  no  Word for 6 weeks!  Weehey!  A break for me and enough
time for you lot to come up with some articles for next issue.

 Just  skimmed  satellite  channels  and  I notice the news channels are
raving on about Mike Tyson's fight with Hollyfield.  The guy's a mad dog
by  the  sound of it (ain't seen any clips of the incident yet).  Biting
someones  ears  off  is  just  not  boxing.   Anyway, there's a possible
article for someone.  "Boxing today".

 How  many of you have internet access?  Well I'll probably know soon if
enough  of  you  complete  the  questionnaire featured in this issue.  I
asked  this  question  because the internet is more addictive than ever.
There's  just  so  much  information out there and you want access to it
all,  NOW!  The tip is making that information come to you.  This is not
easy  but  one  way  I  found to get a decent chunk of the information I
want,  coming  to  me,  is to sign up on a couple of mailing lists.  The
hacker  ones  are  the  best  as  they  discuss  everything and anything
relating  to computing and all the major news media companies around the
world  monitor  them  as well.  Take for instance, Se7en.  As soon as he
announced  his  intention  to attack paedophiles using his hacker skills
and  contacts,  within  hours  it  was all over the world news!  I found
about  it  the  same  time  as these people by being on the same mailing
list.   I  even  posted  a  reply  back  to  the guy within hours of his
posting,  myself.   This  looks  like it may be another interesting case
that  the media will eat up, twist the facts so that someone can write a
truthfull account of the events and grab some royalties on a book deal.
 Everyone is getting connected so they can access a world of information
at  a touch of a button or at least the typing of a few keys and a mouse
click.   People  are discussing any topic that interests them within the
present  few  minutes  untill it gets old (a few minutes later), leaving
behind  a  load of not too well thought out garbage for everyone else to
sort  through  in  order  to  find  something  of use.  This is known as
finding the signal among all the noise.

 That's  what  we  hope to produce in The Word, a clear signal providing
you  with  interesting  information,  a good read and less noise to sort
through.
