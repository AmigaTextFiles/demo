Well, about music, anyway...

Here's  some  rather  difficult  music  questions  for you.  They mainly
consist  of  "What  are  these  lines  from?" or "Who sang this?", but I
guarantee some will tax yer brain..  hehe...


 1. Who sang "Ring My Bell" ?

 2. Okay, how about "Car Wash" ?

 3. In what song do the words "Me and my brother, me and my cousin, my
    little sister too..." appear?

 4.  Who made the orgasmic "French Kiss"?

 5.  "This is how it feels", by whom?

 6.  The song started "Hey you!  Don't watch that, watch this!", what
     song was it and who was it sang by?

 7.  Who sang "Rush hour"?

 8.  Who sang "99 Red Balloons"?

 9.  Maybe a bit easier, who sang "Born to be sold"?

10.  Should get this one, who played sax in "Sax-a-go-go"?

11.  It's  the tune to that cool Lynx ad "Boom-Shak-A-Lak", but who was
     it by?

12.  Name the only song on the ORIGINAL Blues Brothers soundtrack album
     that consisted of one word and one word only.

13.  Who sang "You can call me Al"?

14.  What about "What's the colour of money"?

15.  And "World shut your mouth"?

16.  Okay,  they  were  fairly  difficult,  what  about  "Walk  like an
     egyptian"?

17.  Who sang "Birdhouse in your soul"?

18.  What about "Lie still, little bottle"?

19.  Who  made  and  what  was  the  title  for  the famous Guinness ad
     featuring that  wierd dancing bloke?

20.  On what recent album does the song "Fool for love", by Sandy Rogers
     feature?



Told  you  it  was hard.  Unless you got them all.  If you got more than
10, you are a genius.  If you got less than 5..  um...well, a pat on the
back  and we're all off down the pub to look at that rickety juke-box in
the corner that hasn't worked for the past five years.
