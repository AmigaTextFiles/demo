 I  figured  that seen as how I had compiled all the group news into one
file  this  issue that the scence section would look a little redundant.
However  it  turned  out  to  be the sports section that looked a little
empty because at the time of writing, there were zero contributions.
 Not  being  an active sporty person myself (unless you count collecting
sporty  spice  posters  as  active!), I figured that the majority of you
guys would send in some sports related material.  However, not being one
to  gripe I figured I'd inject some suggestions for future articles that
could appear in this space...
