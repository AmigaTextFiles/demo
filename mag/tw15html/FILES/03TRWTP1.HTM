I still haven't finished this amazing game and I probably won't untill I
get  my  hands  on a PC copy or another PSX which I can borrow.  Anyway,
for  all  you  TR fans out there stuck at some point in the game, here's
the walk-through which I grabbed off da net.

                                         Happy adventuring!

                                                            Kei/Carnage


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1 - Caves - Items: 7 - Secrets: 3 - Kills 14

Follow  the tracks running past the slots with the poison darts.  If you
keep running the darts will miss you.  Continue around the corner.  Lara
will  look  up  at a ledge indicating the way to go but first we need to
get a secret.  Continue straight into a large square room with a door in
the  corner.  You must use the slanted rock to jump onto this door.  You
can  either  jump back then forward off the sloped face or you can climb
up  the  back of the sloped rock and jump as you slide down.  Either way
you  will  grip  the  base  of  the  door to enter SECRET #1 and get the
medkit.

Returning  to  the  other cave, climb up and head down the passage.  The
sounds  of  bats  should alert you to draw your gun and kill them.  Turn
left  and  proceed to a dead end cave with snow drifted into one corner.
Climb  the  drift  as far as you can then use the action key to grab the
ledge  and  pull  yourself  up.   Waste  the bat and grab the Medkit for
SECRET  #2.   Return  to the bat cave and continue.  You will eventually
end  up  in  a  large grass covered cavern sloped down.  Make you way to
bottom  and  drop into the tunnel.  Go to the door and use the switch to
open  the  door.  Kill the bat as you enter this large room.  Ignore the
bamboo door - you can't open it anyway.

Find the hole in the roof and climb up.  Make your way to the large room
with 2 bridges and 2 wolves patrolling the ground.  You can sniper these
guys  from  the  ledge.   You  can either wind your way around using the
bridges  your take the shortcut by dropping to the ground and proceeding
to  the second bridge.  Standing in the middle jump and pull yourself up
onto  the  bridge  and  go to your right.  Continue through the door and
into the next room.

There  is  a  large gap in this room with a bear at the bottom.  You can
make  this  jump  and  save your game either before or after killing the
bear  from  above.   Drop  down  into  the  gap by gripping the edge and
dropping  in  to avoid taking damage.  Go through the door killing the 2
bats.   Grab the medkit and then stand on the pressure plate to open the
door.  You will now enter the bridge room.  Climb back up the bridge and
retrace your path back to the gap.  Proceed down the stairs.  There is a
medkit to the left of the stairs if you are collecting these things.

As you enter the room the music starts and the wolves attack.  Kill both
of them quickly.  Notice on the far wall there is a door cleverly hidden
in  the  vegetation.   A  ledge extends from the door which you can jump
onto from either side.  Enter this door for SECRET #3 - a large medkit.

The  other  door  out  of this room is on a timed switch.  Go to the far
corner  and  throw  the switch.  Then either make 2 skilled jumps to the
ledge  with  the  door or just drop down - run across - and climb up and
run  through the door.  Continue up and turn the corner.  Run past the 2
dart  shooting  pipes  and into the next room.  A single wolf is waiting
for  you  so  watch  out.   There are 2 broken floor tiles in this room.
Stand on either one to fall (safely) into the room below.

Do not drop into the hall below - it is lined with dart traps.  Find the
ledge  where  you  can  safely jump across to the other side.  Shoot the
last  wolf on this level and pick up the medkit.  Continue on and around
the  corner  to  find a switch.  Move it to open the EXIT.  To avoid the
darts just slide down the sloped wall next to the EXIT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 2 - City of Vilcabama - Items: 11 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 29

Run  into  the  first room and kill the 4 wolves lurking in there.  Jump
around to avoid their attacks and keep firing.  There are multiple exits
from  this  room.  Take whichever one you want as they all end up at the
same  place  eventually.   Kill  all  the wolves and bats you encounter.
Some  bats are lurking in the ceiling so look UP often.  One wolf guards
a  medkit  hidden  in the bushes.  Eventually you will end up in a large
room with a pool in the middle.

There  is  a  wooden  trough along one wall.  If you go near this wall a
large  bear  comes charging out.  Dodge his attacks and kill him quickly
then  enter  the room he came out of.  Climb up onto the ledge above the
stable  and  get  the  medkit.  Now return to the pool room and go for a
swim.

Dive  in  and go to the T intersection and turn right.  Make a U-turn to
the  left  when you reach the pillars and throw the wood lever to open a
secret  door in another area.  If you still have enough air (about half)
then  swim to the opposite side of the pillar room into the brightly lit
area.  Throw the other wooden switch to open a hatch above you.  Surface
and breath.  Exit the water and get SECRET #1 - a medkit.

Throw  the  switch  to open door and return to the main room.  Dive into
the  pool  again  and this time swim to the T and turn left.  Follow the
passage  to  a  left  turn and follow until you surface into a room with
serpent  fountains.   Exit  the  pool and go through the secret door you
opened  early  (remember  that  lever)  and get SECRET #2 - a medkit and
magnum clips.  Return to the main pool room and surface.

Find  the  door  with the switch (looks like zebra stripes) and open the
door.  Climb the wooden stairs and make the tricky jump at the top.  You
will  be  looking  across  at  an alcove made of skulls.  Below you is a
ledge  of  collapsible  panels.  Drop down and run and jump over to this
alcove.   This is tricky and if you don't do it the first time you don't
get another chance.  It's only a medkit so don't worry if you don't make
it.  Drop into the room below (if you didn't land there by accident) and
find the blue stone with the two indentations.

Using  the action key and the UP arrow Lara can push this block into the
wall.   It  takes  several pushes to move it all the way.  If you missed
the  large  jump and really want that medkit in the skull alcove you can
use  the  action  key and down arrow to pull the block into the room and
use it to climb into the alcove.

Once  you  are  in the next room kill the bat and get the Silver Key and
the  Gold  Idol.   Using  the block you pushed in, climb up and onto the
wooden  ledge.   Kill the 2 bats in the rafters and save your game.  Run
around  the corner and kill 2 more bats.  Drop into the passage and turn
left.  You should now be back in the main pool room.  Turn left again to
find the locked door.  The action key will unlock the door.

Darts  line  the  walls  of this room and you will take at least one hit
UNLESS  you  do  a dive.  Just run and jump and hit action while in mid-
air and you will hit the ground rolling - no damage!

You  are  now  in a large area with a temple at the far end and 5 wolves
with  bad attitudes scattered about.  Kill them as they charge doing all
that  fancy  jumping to avoid their fangs.  Enter the temple through the
left  door.   Follow  the  passage  into  a pool room with ledges on the
walls.   Climb the stairs and being the jumping process to go from ledge
to  ledge.   Climb  the  stairs  and  kill the bat then make a long jump
across  the  top of this tower.  Climb some more stairs and kill another
bat.  Find and use the wall switch to open the temple's right door.  Get
the medkit then go to the window.

Looking  down  at the ledge find the shotgun shells.  Execute the safety
drop  onto the roof and get the shells then drop to the red roof and get
the  medkit.   Drop  once  more  to the ground and enter the right door.
This  is  another room with water and ledges and collapsing floor tiles.
Go to the left and stair-step up the ledges along this wall.  At the top
kill  the  bat,  climb  the stairs and use the switch to open the middle
door  of the temple.  Go outside and save the game then execute a series
of safety drops to the ground.  Enter the middle door.

A  long  tunnel with a series of swinging blades is your next challenge.
Just  use  simple  timing to get past these guys.  You will reach a gate
with  a bear behind it.  Use the switch.  The floor drops out from under
you and you go for another swim.  Swim forward and up and into the small
tunnel on the right.  The tunnel leads to stairs which leads to a switch
that  opens  the  gate you were at moments ago and the exit gate.  Go to
one  of  the windows and dive into the pool below (or do a safety drop).
You  have to kill the bear and you can't shoot from the water.  The bear
will  follow  you  and  attack  as you try to exit the pool.  I found it
easier to drop to the ground and blast him.  You can also run around the
pool keeping the bear at a safe distance.

Once  the  bear is dead go to the locked door.  To the left of this door
is  an  open  door.   Enter  the door and go up the stairs to the switch
room.  There is a passage opposite the switch which leads to a room with
Uzi  clips.  Return to the pool room with the dead bear and use the Gold
Idol to unlock the EXIT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 3 - Lost Valley - Items: 16 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 12

Follow  the tunnel until you reach the river.  You can either jump in or
go  to  your  right and do some cliff diving.  Find a safe place to exit
the lake and kill the 2 wolves on patrol.  Climb over the rocks opposite
the  waterfall  and  enter  the  cave.   Kill the wolf that attacks then
continue further and turn right.  Jump into the slanted chamber and kill
the  3  wolves  waiting here.  Don't go any further as it is just a dead
end.   Return  to  the  room you were just in and find the ledge you can
pull  yourself  up  onto.  Continue climbing until you find the skeleton
and a medkit.  Continue forward and slide down into the valley.

A  red  Raptor rushes you.  Fire as fast as you can and dodge this guy's
attacks.   When  he is dead enter the valley and kill the second raptor.
Check your health at this point and make sure its FULL.  Note the broken
rope  bridge  above.   Note the HUGE FOOTPRINTS below.  Note the size of
the  teeth  on  the  T-Rex  that  just  rounded the corner.  Do a LOT of
side-jumping  and  keep firing until this monster is dead.  You may have
to  heal  yourself  in  mid-combat.  NEVER let this guy get close to you
with his mouth or you are dead no matter what your health bar says.

After  he  is  dead  run  past  him  under  the bridge until you reach 2
waterfalls.  Climb the ledge to the right of the right waterfall to find
SECRET  #1:   Shotgun shells.  Go to the ledge between the falls.  Climb
up  2  ledges  and  jump to the right onto the 3rd ledge.  Hold onto the
ledge  and  shimmy to the right until you're in the middle of the falls.
Pull yourself up and into SECRET #2:  Shells and Uzi Clips.

Return  to the ground (climb or dive) and head for the broken bridge and
look  for  a door in the grass covered rock.  Enter the passage and kill
the  raptor waiting down the hall.  Advance until you reach a waterfall.
Climb  the ledges to the right and get Cog #1.  Then dive into the pool.
Swim  until you surface at the right waterfall in the valley.  Turn left
and  advance  to  the  temple  in  the distance.  Take out the 2 raptors
lurking  near  the temple.  Enter the temple and save your game.  Take a
swim  heading  for  the right side of this pool to get Cog #2.  Exit the
temple  and  find  a climbable ledge along the left valley wall near the
dead raptors.

Climb  the  first  ledge  then jump left to the 2nd ledge.  Turn left to
jump  (or grab) the 3rd ledge then do a leap and grab the 4th ledge.  Do
one  more  giant  leap  onto  the  temple roof for SECRET #3 and get the
medkit,  magnum  clips, uzi clips, and shotgun shells.  You can get back
down  by  going left and jumping to the slanted cliff and sliding to the
bottom.  Turn to the right and climb into the cave in the valley wall.

Follow the tunnel and save your game.  Continue until you reach the rope
bridge.   Do the giant leap and grab the other side of the bridge.  Pull
yourself  up  and  continue over to get Cog #3.  Do a safety drop to the
valley  floor  and  make  your way back to the cave above the first huge
waterfall (the beginning of this level).

Next  is a series of jump crisscrossing the river.  Miss one and you are
going  for a ride over the falls so BE CAREFUL!  The final jump requires
you  to grab the edge and pull yourself up.  Follow the tunnel and cross
the  bridge.   Save your game before crossing then use the 3 Cogs on the
wall then pull the lever.  The dam shuts and the waterfall stops.

Do  NOT  cross  the  bridge  but  rather  drop off the side and grab on.
Shimmy  left and drop onto a rock.  Go up and turn left to SECRET #4 and
get a medkit.  Jump in the water and swim until you reach the dam.  Turn
left  and  pull  yourself  up onto the ledge.  Find the skeleton and get
their  shotgun (they don't need it anymore).  Jump back in the water and
enter  a  tunnel.   This  is  a very long tunnel but you will eventually
surface into SECRET #5 with shotgun shells and a medkit.

Go  through  the  door and jump onto the dry riverbed.  Follow it to the
waterfall  (or  rather where the waterfall used to be) and dive into the
lake  below.   There  is  now  a  tunnel you can get to which used to be
blocked by the waterfall.  Enter the tunnel and open the door and EXIT!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 4 - Tomb of Qualopec - Items: 7 - Secrets: 3 - Kills: 7

Follow the tunnel and enter the Tomb of Qualopec.  Go up the slope and a
huge  boulder  comes  rumbling towards you.  Do the REVERSE move and get
outta  there  making  sure  to  get out of the path as the boulder rolls
across the tomb and into the entrance.

Pull  the switch to open the door to the left.  This frees 2 raptors who
you  can  dispatch  with your pistol.  Go into the room they came out of
and save your game.  Go through the door on your right and into the next
room.   There are big brown blocks in here you get to push around.  Push
the  first  block  forward  twice  Turn  left  and push another block to
continue.   Run across some collapsible tiles to a switch that opens the
first  of  3 gates.  Jump the pit you just ran across and go back to the
room  where  you  saved your game.  Go to the right door with the circle
over  it  and  follow  the  passage  to  a  small  alcove with a switch.
Approach  the switch and fall through the floor.  Go up one of the ramps
and  pull  the block into the room then push it aside to find a passage.
Enter and go up stome steps and drop into a pit and get the medkit.

Climb up the opposite side of the pit then go up the stairs and pull the
switch  to  open  Gate #2.  Grab the medkit in the corner then drop back
into  the  pit.  Go back to the room where you saved your game and enter
the  door  with  the bird.  Find and use the switch to move a block with
the  same  bird  symbol  on  it.   Drop down into the room with the bird
symbol  block  and  go  to the left door.  Go up some stairs and turn to
face  the  white  ledge.   Jump and grab several times until you reach a
tunnel  which  takes you to the block with the bird.  Drop down a couple
times  then  turn left and drop down again until you are across from the
bird.   Jump  the gap and land on the bird block.  Perform a tricky jump
into  the tunnel to the left of where you just landed.  Enter the tunnel
and pull the switch to move another bird block.

Return  to  the tunnel entrance and walk to the edge facing to the right
and  make  a leap of faith to a block you can't see from here.  Turn and
do  a  jump onto the second bird block then turn right and jump into the
door.   Pull  the switch in this room to open the final gate.  Exit this
passage  and  jump  to  avoid the spike below.  Go up the small ramp and
climb  up to the door.  Move down the right passage and waste the raptor
before  he  gets you.  Go back to the room where you saved your game and
back  into  the  first room of this level.  Enter the new passage.  Save
your  game and then run past the dart guns.  Doing the swandive with the
roll  is a good way to not get hit here.  When you reach the stairs turn
to your left.

SECRET  #1  waits  for you if you climb up just to the right of the dart
gun.   Squeeze  next  to  the idol then run across a whole room of those
broken floor tiles.  Head for the left corner and get the shotgun shells
then  go  for  SECRET  #2.  Drop off the ledge and shimmy to the outside
wall  and  drop  on  the  spiked floor.  WALK - DO NOT RUN - through the
spikes  and  pick  up the magnum clips under the ledge you were just on.
Walk through all the spikes to the door above and climb up and out.

Drop down to some steps and go up to the chamber with the first piece of
the  Scion.  Don't take the piece until you have killed the guard on the
left  side  of  the king's throne.  In true Indiana Jones fashion taking
this  piece starts a tremor.  Run back quickly to the main entrance room
and  past  the  boulder  that smashed into this room earlier.  Save your
game then take a swim.

You'll  find  yourself  underfire.  Larson - your contact at the cafe is
trying  to  kill you.  Before you finish him off, swim to the bottom and
find  a small tunnel.  Follow the tunnel to SECRET #3 and get the medkit
and  magnum clips.  Heal yourself then go kick Larson's butt.  Enjoy the
cool movie clip and rest up for the Labyrinth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 5 - St. Francis' Folly - Items: 18 - Secrets: 4 - Kills: 21

Start  this  level  by going right and climbing the wall.  Go to the end
and  kill the 2 lions lurking about.  Go to the block with the horseshoe
symbol  behind  it  and pull the block ontop of the symbol to unlock the
door above you.  Push the block forward a couple of times to open a door
at ground level then push the block again so you can climb on it later.

Go  through  the door and kill the 2 gorillas and pull the switch across
from  the door.  Go to the stairs on the right and kill another gorilla.
Continue  up  the  stairs and throw the switch to open another door.  Go
outside  and  shoot  the  other explorer waiting for you in the pillars.
Dodge a lot and run in circles to shoot him from behind - like the T-Rex
and  Larson.   He  will  run away after eating enough lead.  Let him go!
You can't kill him anyway - believe me - I tried!

Back  in  the  main  room - climb onto the block you pushed earlier then
jump across to another column.  Start bunny-hopping these columns to get
a  medkit.   Turn  left and jump some more to reach the door.  Now comes
the tricky part...

Stand  on  the  far  left of the doorway ontop of the arrows.  Jump left
then  jump right and up grabbing the ledge.  Standing on the ledge, face
the  smaller  of  the two sloped ledges and backup.  Jump onto the lower
slope  then  backward  then  forward and grab the ledge above you.  Very
tricky  but  it  takes  you  to SECRET #1 - shotgun shells and a medkit.
Climb back down to avoid damage taken by falling through broken floor.

Back  in  the main room hop back to the column where you got the medkit.
Do  a  long  jump  to  the  ledge to the left then turn left and begin a
series of jumps to reach the door (the one you unlocked from the floor).

Go  down  the hall making sure you are sliding forward!  Just before you
reach the end of the sloped passage jump into the air.  You'll land on a
small  ledge  below.   Jump across to the door and grab it.  If you miss
you  cannot try without resetting the level.  Get SECRET #2 - shells and
medkit  then  turn around and check out that big croc in the water.  You
can  kill  him  if  you  want but it takes a long time.  You can just as
easily avoid him.

Jump  in and swim forward and up into the first opening to get SECRET #3
-  more  shotgun  shells.   Take another swim and go to the next opening
where  you  can  pull  the switch and drain the water from this passage.
Drop  into  the passage and kill the croc (if you didn't already).  He's
easier to shoot now but he's also a lot faster so dodge him quickly!

Go  to  the  end of the tunnel and save your game.  Jump to the ledge in
the middle of the room and shoot the 3 bats flying around.  Drop down to
a ledge on your right then once more to the floor below.  Pull the lever
to  open  the THOR DOOR.  Jump to your right and land on the gray square
to open a secret door.  This door is timed so you have to be FAST!

Turn  right  and  go  the  the edge.  Roll as you land and keep running.
Roll at the edge and drop down shooting the 2 bats as they appear.  Drop
down  once  more,  taking  some minor damage, and enter the secret door.
SECRET  #4  consists of medkit and magnum clips.  Exit the room and save
the game.  Use the switch to open the ATLAS DOOR.

Climb  the  stairs  then jump and grab the ledge.  Jump to the ledge and
get  the magnum clips either before or after killing the bat.  Jump back
to  the  first  ledge and move across about half way.  Jump and grab the
middle  ledge  then go around the left corner and use the switch to open
the NEPTUNE DOOR.

Do  a REVERSE and jump across to the stairs.  Turn around and jump up to
the  ledge  with  the  save game gem and save your game.  Enter the THOR
DOOR  to  your  left.   Inside is a cool plasma sphere shooting electric
bolts  to  the  floor.   A  pattern  of blocks is laid out in a circular
pattern.  If you are in this circle when the bolts hit - you get zapped!
Time the bolts and make your way across this room.

The  next  room  has  a large hammer suspended from the ceiling and some
markings  on  the  floor.  Stand on the symbol.  When you hear something
break  jump back and the hammer will smack the floor.  Don't move!  Wait
for a couple of blocks to fall to the floor.  Push the block a few times
against  the  wall near the head part of Thor's hammer.  Use it to climb
up to the ledge where you can pull the second block out a few times then
use it to climb and jump over to an even higher ledge.

Get  the small medkit then jump across to the ledge on your left.  Enter
the  small room and get the THOR KEY then jump back and climb down.  Run
through the electric room and make your way back and exit the THOR DOOR.

At  the edge turn left and jump to a ledge that looks slightly different
than  the others.  Your friend from earlier is shooting at you so hop to
a  small  ledge  on  your  right and kill the 2 bats that are attacking.
Turn  and jump to the middle ledge then go up the stairs to find a lever
which  opens  the  DAMOCLES  DOOR.   Climb the stair and enter the ATLAS
DOOR.

Kill  the gorilla waiting for you in here then run ahead and through the
gate.   A  medkit  is  in the pit to your left.  Run up the hill until a
huge boulder comes rumbling towards you.  Do a REVERSE and run away.  As
you  near  the pit do another REVERSE and drop back and grab the edge of
the  pit.  The boulder will sail harmlessly overhead.  Start back up the
hill  and  about half way jump to the ledge on your left.  Jump up again
and  get  the  ATLAS  KEY on the other side of the ledge.  Make your way
back and exit the ATLAS DOOR.

Go to the highest step and jump up and climb to the next level.  Jump to
the  stairs  on  your left.  Shoot some bats and go to the highest step.
Jump  to the middle ledge and go to the other side and enter the NEPTUNE
DOOR.   Go  for a swim.  The current will move you along but you need to
swim  up and to you left to enter a small tunnel.  Pull the lever at the
end of this tunnel then return to the main tunnel.  Swim forward and get
the  NEPTUNE  KEY.   Go  to  the  other  side of the passage and surface
quickly as you are probably almost out of air by now.

Climb  out  of the water and exit through the NEPTUNE DOOR.  Jump to the
middle  ledge  and  climb  down  to  the ledge across from the sandstone
stairs.  Jump over to the stairs and go down the the DAMOCLES DOOR.  Get
the medkit ontop of the door before you enter.

Don't worry about those swords hanging from the ceiling.  Go to the next
room  and get the DAMOCLES KEY then hoist yourself up and get the shells
and medkit on the ledge above.  Leave this room slowly.  The swords will
start  falling - just watch the shadows and listen for them to fall.  If
you  walk  you  will  be able to stop just short of the sword.  Exit the
DAMOCLES DOOR drop down onto the small ledge and once more to the ground
where  you can start shooting at the 2 cougars and that hostile explorer
who's  been  after  you.   You  should also probably save your game here
(just in case).

The  cougars  will  die and the explorer will run away again.  Go to the
door  and  use  the  4 keys you've been collecting in each of the locks.
The bars will be removed and you can EXIT this huge level.  WHEW!
