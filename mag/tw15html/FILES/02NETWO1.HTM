You've got a PC, so have all your friends, you play all the latest games
but  getting  them  onto  your  harddisk  is  a  right royal pain in the
posterior, and one you do, you play them for ages and eventually run out
of things to do with it, so you delete it.

If  you  or  your mates have a car and don't mind a bit of lugging about
and  extra  expenditure,  you should think about setting up a network on
your  computers.   In  the past this was the province of large companies
who  wanted  to  be able to share resources etc, and the home user never
thought he's see the day when he'd need one for himself.

These  days  however,  everyone  who is even semi-serious about their PC
should  have  a  network  card  of  some  description installed in their
machine,  all  the people I regularly swap and play games with have one,
and  like  other  hardware  that you've had for a while, I would hate to
have to make do without my card, life just wouldn't be the same.

<font color =#704C4C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Which One?</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#88584C>
As usual with the PC, there are chigloads of cards to chose from, and if
you  don't  know  what  you want then you won't know what to buy or even
where to look for it.  Pick up a copy of PC Mart and have a look through
the  adverts  under  Networking,  you  are  looking  for  prices for the
following items:

    NE2000 or compatible ISA or PCI card
    T-Piece and Terminator
    Cable

ISA  is  slower  and  therefore cheaper than PCI, and that's what we all
use.   One  thing  to  note is that PCI cards will talk to ISA cards and
vice-versa,  some  people have expressed confusion over this point, it's
basically  an  interface,  and it's the card that does the work, not the
interface it's on.

As  usual  you should count the slots in your machine and determine that
you  do  in  fact have a free ISA slot, if not then you'll need to get a
PCI  card  instead,  and  if  you don't have *any* free slots, then your
machine  is  massively crammed full and you should think about getting a
whole new motherboard (with more slots!!).

<font color =#704C4C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Is that like a NMC?</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#88584C>
We all remember Null Modem Cables (NMC) from our Amiga days (indeed, see
the  guide  in  this issue for how to make one for your PC from two dead
mice), they are set up in the following fashion:

                         Amiga            Amiga
                           |                |
                           `----------------'

This  allowed  you  to play against another human player on a completely
seperate  machine,  games  such as Populos, Knights of the Sky and Stunt
Car  Racer  gave  you  a  whole  new (usually harder) playing experience
thanks to this one piece of cable, but the limitation was that you could
only link up two machines.

In a Local Area Network (LAN), the machines are arranged as follows:

          PC1          PC2         PC3         PC4         PC5
           |            |           |           |           |
          =^------------^-----------^-----------^-----------^=

Each  PC  has a T-Piece, represented above by the "^" character, joining
it  into  the  network, the PC's are arranged in a line, which of course
can  bend  all through the building, it really doesn't matter, the cable
("---", above) is pretty flexible and can be coiled for neatness.

The  "=" represents a Terminator, and one of these has to appear at each
end of the line.  The explanation I have been given for this is that the
signal  that  runs along the cable must have an end to bounce off and so
come  back  down the cable.  Why this "end" cannot be another machine is
beyond me, it just is.

Therefore,  in order to be ready for any eventuality network-wise, it is
advisable  for everyone who gets a card to buy a T-Piece, Terminator and
a cable as well, even though a network always requires one less piece of
cable than there are machines, and only two machines, no matter how many
there are, will require terminators.

More  and  more  PC  Games  these  days support Networking, not just LAN
networks but Direct Connection, Modem and Internet play as well.  LAN is
by  far the fastest of all the connection methods, and you can even play
with  someone  across  the road if you don't mind stretching the cable a
bit,  making it possible for entire streets to be networked up, although
I  have  yet to hear of anyone doing this!  And of course, LAN means you
don't have to pay BT anything... :)

The most obvious benefit is the number of players, with Quake - the best
network  game ever (being the one that *everyone* plays eventually, like
buying  Brothers  in Arms on CD) - supporting up to 16 players either on
their  own, cooperatively, or in teams, vast gaming experiences are just
around  the  corner, there's a 5-player Deathmatch at my house tomorrow,
but you won't read this until a month afterwards.

More  and  more  games  are  being  written  just for networking, with a
one-player game thrown in for good measure.  Quake is, in actual fact, a
Network  ONLY  game, when you play it in single player mode it is simply
sending network messages between memory buffers instead of down a cable.

The  major upshot is the fact that every other machine on the network is
available  to  you as if it were a drive on your machine.  Just a couple
of  mouse  clicks  will  open up someone else's C drive and you can copy
from (or to, if they've given you permission) it at your leisure.

The  speed  is  quite  amazing  as well, most cards (at least that we've
seen)  are 10mB, no that's not 10 Megabytes, it's 10 MegaBITS, there are
8mB  to  a  Mb, so 10mB = 1.25Mb a SECOND!  Yes that's right, on a basic
LAN setup (assuming noone else is copying or playing over the network at
the time) you can achieve copying speeds of around a Meg a second.

The other Games advantage that you may not have spotted is that, because
of  this vast bandwidth availability, you can run incredibly complicated
games  that  involve  lots of numbers being passed between machines, and
you  won't  have  to wait for that information to reach you.  This means
lags that made games like Battlechess so strange will all but disappear,
and only in the most crowded Quakefest will you notice them.

<font color =#704C4C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>OK, How much?</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#88584C>
Ooh, the big question, how much?  If you saw my two letters on Digitiser
recently  (two  letters in one day, who else has managed that?) then you
will already know the answer.  You can pick up an ISA card, with T-Piece
and Terminator for, gasp...

<font color =#704C4C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>£25!</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#88584C>
Well,  I  know  I can, and that's from a shop, not mail order.  Flicking
through PC Mark we see the following advert:

      Database Office Supplies: NE2000 pnp ISA - £18.80 (inc VAT)

This  is  a typical price, I have seen them cheaper and I have seen them
costing  more.   Remember that this does not include a Cable, T-Piece or
Terminator,  add  maybe 3-5 for the metal, the Cable depends on how much
you  want,  and remember that you'll have to put delivery on top of that
as well.

I  can certainly get you everything you want for a PC for under £30, and
that's  with  a good 5m cable, which is considered long enough for those
times  when you can't sit someone's computer next you, what's more, that
probably  INCLUDES  delivery!   If  you'd  like me to get you the latest
prices  (From my local hardware sales/repair store) then E-Mail me, I am
in the directory.

My charge?  You pay any postage costs (minimal if you use E-Mail) and if
I don't know you, I ask for payment in advance, that's all, I don't want
any money out if it!  This could actually end up cheaper because I don't
use courier delivery at £10+vat a time, but registered, saving about £5.

Read  up  on  Networking  before  you decide what to do, as the software
installation  can  sometimes  be  a pain, especially as you need another
machine with a network card already working in it to test it out!  Speak
to  your friends, do they own cars?  Are they bored with 1-player Quake?
See if they're interested, and if so, go for it!

(By the way, the Deathmatch lasted for 7 hours and we were beaten 174 to
168, the gits  :(
