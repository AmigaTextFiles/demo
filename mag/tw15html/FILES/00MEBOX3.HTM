You can visit the Bodyshop Central test site at:

                http://ds.dial.pipex.com/limelight/bsc/

Remember  that  this is only a test site, and thus a bit bare, the final
one  will  probably  be  50Mb and have it's own domain name, but it will
still be completely FREE!

Watch out for the HTML version of The Word, it should be released at the
same time as the regular version, starting with issue 16, so now all you
PeeCee-owning dudds can read it without running UAE, har har!

Nadgers!   UAE  is  perfectly  usable on my P133, the difference between
mine and the one you mentioned are my 512k cache and the fact that I use
the DirectX version and have a Matrox Mystique, which is three times the
speed of a standard video card anyway, before you get to the accelerated
drawing commands and whatnot!

Faster cards do exist on the market!  My mate has a P200mmx, not even on
a  TX chipset motherboard (it's a VX like mine) and it runs at the speed
of  a  stock  A1200,  probably  faster!   It's  mainly down to the video
redrawing  speed,  not the processing power, just swapping my video card
gave a massive speed increase.
