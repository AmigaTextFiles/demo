                           By D!ck
Regular readers of this mag will know Andy Bolt and myself from our 
various antics in the magazine.  We both recently moved over to the PC 
but for some reason found it quite difficult to give up completely on 
The Word.  It's a damned good read and we were both regulars, so we 
tried to carry on.

&amp;

Unfortunately this meant using the Unix Amiga Emulator which, while 
doing the job perfectly adequately, didn't really use our machines to 
the full.  After a bit of discussion we tried knocking together a HTML 
version of The Word, and it turned out to be quite easy.  We spoke to 
Kei/Carnage about making it a regular thing and so, after much effort 
and quite a lot of fun, here it is, a version of The Word that will run 
on any machine that has a browser, it will run in any resolution, any 
number of colours, and on any processor type.

Naturally there are people who will for some reason by offended by this,
we are expecting hate mail or reviews in other mags that flame us for 
daring to use something so simple as a file format to spread a mag, but 
so what?  For years now, Amiga Report has been spread in AmigaGuide 
format, a simplified version of HTML, and that never hurt it's 
readership at all, HTML is a natural progression from that, it allows 
for more creativity and is more suited to graphics than Amigaguide ever 
was.

The Amiga-specific version will continue to be produced at least until 
downloads of the HTML version exceed downloads of the DMS files.  When 
that starts to happen we will think seriously about the future of the 
Amiga version, and probably still carry on with it, despite it being 
uneconomical or whatever.  The Amiga version was my baby originally, 
before I left the Amiga scene and passed it on to Carnage, and so it is 
very special to us all.  Because of that it will probably continue to 
appear.
