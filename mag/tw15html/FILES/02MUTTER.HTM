Why is it that people only seem to tell you stuff when it's far too late
for you to do anything about it?  Almost everyone must have at some time
bought something, only to be told "You could have got it cheaper at such
and  such".   Why?   Why do some people take such a perverse interest in
upsetting people in this manner?

Another more recent one was about my scene days on the Amiga, I got some
E-Mail  basically saying "oh yeah, you were dead popular, everyone knows
you"  and  so  on, fat lot of good it is telling me this AFTER I've quit
the  bloody  scene  innit?   If people had actually said something to me
while  I  was  thinking of getting the PC then I might not have bothered
and I might just have kept my old A1200.

I wonder if a lot of this is because people are a bit timid where making
suggestions  is  concerned?  Sometimes if you're up to something, people
do  not  like  to say anything in case you consider them nosey, and tell
them  where  to  get off.  In most situations a little bit of thought is
all  you  need  to  decide  whether to speak up or not, if you have some
information and you think it would be useful, tell someone!

Of  course, it would help if the person doing the buying, programming or
whatever  made sure that other people around them actually knew what was
going on!  That way there would be a lot less of this sort of thing!  Us
lads  up  here in Lincolnshire *always* discuss stuff first so that this
sort  of  thing  doesn't  usually  happen,  if  someone  is going to buy
something for their computer, car, office or home or whatever, they make
sure that other people know about it, just in case!

Does that qualify as a rant?  Possibly...

Have  you  seen  that  Lynx  advert  on  the telly with whatsername from
friends?  Isn't it a corker?  "Do you have to go out tonight?" she asks,
tilting  her  head  to  one  side and smiling sweetly into the camera, I
think that ad is a corker, best I've seen in a long time!

And  what  about  that  Lucozade NRG one that looks like the Firestarter
video as well?  Nomination for the funniest advert ever?  You betcha!

But  one  thing  that still get me is those Always Ultra ads, you'll see
them  tip  some  blue  stuff  onto  one of these pads to demonstrate how
absorbant  it  is, but if you look closely the message "5 minutes later"
appears  at  the bottom of the screen.  Does this mean then that, when a
woman  feels  she  has  soiled  her pad, she has to take it off for five
minutes to allow the liquid to soak into the material, before putting it
back on?  Urgh!  No thank YOU missus!

And if I see one more woman stroke a baby's bum!

What  about  that  one  with  the two birds getting ready to go out?  "I
don't have many men in my bathroom" one of 'em says, plus loads of other
stuff about how men are totally useless.  If a bloke said something like
that  then they'd be slated to hell and back for being sexist, why is it
okay for women to say it though?  I blame the Spice Girls, me.

What's that you say?  Losy me marbles?

Let's look objectively at this, the Spice Girls are pushing the ideology
of "Girl Power", nothing more than a trendy Women's Lib movement.  While
I  and  just  about  every other bloke I know, has no objection to women
being  treated  as  quals  and  all that, I firmly object to the way the
Spice  Girls  are promoting active independance, "Girls!  Throw off your
bras  and  be  load  and crude all you like!" That seems to be the Spice
Girls message!

Fine, right, you want to be treated like that?  The next time a woman in
Spicesque  garb  gives  me any lip I'm gonna smack her in the teeth, she
wants  to  act  like a bloke, I'll treat her like a bloke!  Thankfully a
lot  of  the girls my age around here still know the meaning of the word
"femininity"  and  don't go round looking like averts for Smarties, they
still  wear  bras  and  have  some  sense  of  decency,  but the younger
generation  are  becoming unruly and you can trace that straight back to
the Spice Girls.

The  Spice  Girls  have  already been banned in at least one school, the
head  was  concerned  about the conduct of the younger pupils since they
appeared  on the scene, and quite rightly has banned anything to do with
them from is school.

HIS  SCHOOL you notice, a resposible attitude from a BLOKE!  Spice Girls
fans  don't  seem to know how to be responsible!  My sister for one, and
all  her friends, they all have this "newer new woman" attitude promoted
by  the  Spice Girls, they all give lip, they all think they're it.  How
often  did you see girl gangs roaming the streets at night when you were
13  or  14  years  old?  Never?  Right!  now they're all over the bloody
place,  it's  bad  enough  with  young  lads  getting up to all sorts of
mischief without girls doing it as well.

Phew!  You wanted more articles, remember, Kei?

There's  another  problem,  a  lot  of people are reading The Word - the
counter  on  the web page went up by about 50 hits in one day - but none
of  them  are writing articles for inclusion in future issues.  A lot of
mags  have died through lack of support, whatever happened to Grapevine?
No,  it didn't really die because LSD did, more it died because LSD were
producing  all the articles, so when they died, no more articles, simple
as that.

<font color =#FFFF88>
[I  recently  heard  that LSD are still alive.  Strange since we haven't
seen  anything  from  them in a while.  I think they are still active on
some  boards  and  some of their productive members have started joining
other  groups  to show they ain't dead.  Grapevine did die partly due to
support.  When  I talked with Fish back in 1995 at the Symposium at that
time,  he  told me someone had done a disappearing act with the articles
so they had to start from scratch and it was hard since everyone thought
they  were dead.  Nothing happened since then though.  And yes, it would
be   great  if  a  greater  percentage  of  The  Word  readers  actually
contributed  some  articles.   Some  think  they can't think of anything
worth  contributing  but  I  bet  they  could  if  they  tried.  Read my
editorial for some ideas.  Kei]

NFA  were like this at one point, if we had not gone halves with Carnage
when we did then The Word could well have gone under when myself, Phill,
WB  and  several others all left NFA.  As it is we were able to pass the
work  on to Kei of Carnage (who probably still hates me for it :) who in
turn could use his better web and Amiga connections to spread it more.

However,  The  Word  now  seems to be suffering another article drought:
Gone are Aladdin Sane, Pex, John, Deck the Ripper, Budda, DF0:  and Elf,
gone are all the people who sent in the odd advert and article, gone are
all  those  donations  of  text  and  graphics  from  unknowns and Amiga
regulars.

If you look at it now The Word is filled with articles from the same few
people  every issue, Myself, Carnage, bootblock of Terraform, Andy Bolt,
Dave  Diamond, Mammoth, and er...  is that it?  Where are the legions of
workers  who  took  it to it's peak, when Fish/LSD called it "The number
one  Amiga  magazine"?   They've  deserted  us,  thus we need more fresh
talent from all over the place.

The internet might actually help with this, Kei tells me that users from
a  couple of European countries have pledged their support, and the HTML
version  might bring articles in from the PC side of things, so if these
things  take  off  then we'll have the support we need to keep it going.
Unfortnately,  this will take the magazine away from what it once was, a
magazine  for  the Amiga UK scene who don't want to be up to their necks
in  pure  100%  scene rantings.  It will be a shame, because that's what
made The Word so cool, but if it survives, maybe it'll be worth it.

More rantings in the next issue, maybe, who knows?  :)

[It's  true  that  certain readers are regular contributors and we thank
them.   When I was at the WOA and speaking to someone at the Sadeness PD
stand  he  told me that he had heard that The Word had died with NFA and
that  he  was  not aware that it was still going.  It has therefore been
Carnage's job since taking over this project to make everyone aware that
it  is  still  alive  and  this  has took time but now we feel there are
enough people who are aware of it's continuing existance.  The next step
is  to  make  these  people  realize  that  they  have  the power to say
something  and  be  heard  by  many  by  typing  up  some  articles  and
posting/emailing them in to us.  After doing an internet survey recently
it  was  discoverd  that  the  only  other  Amiga  disk magazine that is
distributed  via the internet as much as The Word is "The Jungle" and it
is not released as often as The Word.
 Another  point is that we are releasing The Word monthly now instead of
every  6-8  weeks and so articles have to arrive faster and we need more
than ever.  If we waited 6-8 weeks we would have no article shortage but
the articles would be old upon release.
 Yes,  several groups both in the UK and abroad have pledged support for
The  Word.   On a sad note however, my main contact and distributor, TFT
in  Norway  just  got  sent  down and will be doing 6 months in jail (to
comence shortly).  Any Norweigen distributors out there???  Kei]
