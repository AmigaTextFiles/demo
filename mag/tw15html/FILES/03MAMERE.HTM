    Product  :  Emulator
    Platform :  PC
    Release  :  Freeware

Just  recently  there has been a surge in Arcade game conversions on the
PC,  now  people  are going even further and releasing emulators to take
the  ROM  images  from  early  arcade  machines  and  run them on a home
computer.

One  of the best examples is MAME - The Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator
-  written  by  Nicola Salmoria.  As it's name implies, it is capable of
running  many  many  arcade  machine ROMS.  This is because in the early
days, many arcade machines were based on the same motherboard, with just
changes in the ROM's defining what game was on the machine.  Emulate the
processors, suss the ROM's, and you have an arcade machine.

MAME  is also supported with externally developed Front Ends.  There is,
for  example,  a front end for Windows 95, which gives you a much better
interface  to  work with, since MAME itself is a CLI-based program.  One
or two mouse clicks and you're away, running all your old favourites.

Well,  not all of them.  The games that I have downloaded and tested are
as follows, and not all of them work 100%...

        Amidar                      Amidar (US Version)
        Battle of Atlantis          Bagman
        Bomb Jack                   Burger Time
        Carnival                    Centipede
        Congo Bongo                 Crazy Kong
        Crush Roller                Donkey Kong
        Donkey Kong 3               Donkey Kong Jr.
        Frogger                     Galaxian (Namco Version)
        Galaxy Wars                 Hangly Man
        Japanese Irem Game          Lady Bug
        Lunar Rescue                Mario Bros.
        Millipede                   Moon Cresta
        Moon Ranger                 Mr. Do
        Mr. Lo                      Ms. Pac Man
        Nibbler                     Pac Man
        Pac Man (Namco Version)     Penta
        Piranha                     Pisces
        Pleiades                    Pooyan
        Puck Man                    Rally X
        Space Invaders Deluxe       Uniwars
        War of the Bugs             Wizard of Wor
        Zaxxon

Some  of  the  games  run  with  the wrong colours, many of them have no
sound,  but all of them are fast and playable on a P133, which means you
can now have your own personal arcade sat on your desk.

Extra  game  ROM's can be downloaded from several sites on the internet,
although  the  authors  of the actual programs will not send you any and
ask you not to send them any for copyright reasons.  Nobody really takes
this  seriously  though,  as the revenue from these old games is all but
nonexistant now.

MAME  can  be  downloaded  from  Dave's  Classic  Video Game and Classic
Console Emulation Page:

         http://www.gamepen.com/gamewire/classic/classic.html/

This  page  also  has loads of ROM images for you to download, plus many
many links to sites of similar interest, it's very well laid out, a real
joy to visit.

If  you  have  a  decent  PC  then this is the place to go, get MAME and
you'll  never have to hunt through the backrooms of the arcades again to
play your old faves.
