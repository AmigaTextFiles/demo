                            "Welcome Back!"

Well  dont  you  just  know  it,after months of withdrawl symptoms after
loosing  the  word disk magazine it rises from the dead for issue number
12.   I  hadn`t  heard that it had came back until a new contact said he
saw  my  advert  in  issue 12,well i was impressed,also to find out that
some of my articles had also been published!

At  the  time  of  writing  (12/2/97)  i  still haven`t seen the new and
improved  version,hopefully  someone  will  send it to me soon and i can
have a good read again.

Thanks  heavens  the word is back in all good pd libraries everywhere,at
last  i  can  finally  get  some sleep at night,oh no hang on a minute i
promised  i`d  shag Demi Moore and Carol Smillie every night of the week
constantly,damn!

A stud`s work is never done!

 Dear Dave

 I  don't  know how to break this to you but it's issue 15 now.  In your
letter  to me you said "Here's some more articles for issue 13".  I must
tell  you  that  in  your  lust  to spend time writing more articles you
seemed  to  of  inadvertantly  missed  a few issues.  However, they were
amazing issues for some reason we cannot explain.  ;)

                           "Forgotten Babes"

Sure we`ve all made lists as to what famous person we would like to make
love  to  but what about the ones we or rather I forgot to include in my
list.   There  are  just  too  many  girls I would make love to but what
follows is a list of girls that although totally beautifull seem to have
been forgotten by our minds.

                      Carol Smillie (lottery host)
                  Anthea Turner (former lottery host)
         Christina Applegate (kelly from married with children)
            Amanda Bearse (marcy from married with children)
                 Helen Slater (from the film supergirl)
              Jayne Seymour (from dr quinn medicine woman)
            Tiffani Amber Theisen (from beverly hills 90210)
           Melissa Joan Hart (from Sabrina the teenage witch)
                 Raquel Welch (from all sorts of films)
                     Christina Ricci (from Casper)


                        And there`s LOADS more!

 Dear Dave

  It's  true that if a person (let's say female here) becomes famous and
appears  on  TV/Satellite  then there's a chance that she will appear on
the  internet  in GIF/JPG form or in some teenage boys "screwable" list,
if  of  course  she's  beautiful.   Take for instance the magazine "FHM"
which  makes  a living on publishing such lists from readers surveys.  A
few years ago FHM was donated to barbers shops and wasn't read as widely
as  today  since  it  went  "girlie".  Soon it will be on the top shelf!
(God knows how I'll reach it then).
 These  lists  are  not really about who you forgot whem compiling it or
how  many  you list but about your tastes, to be honest.  From a list of
females  any  guy  lists, we can get an idea of their "type" and to what
"extremes"  they'd  go (Honor Blackman anyone?).  However, to be honest,
they are very sexist but fun to write!  ;)

                                "Oh No!"

I  just thought that because of my good friend the Arab my articles will
appear  on  every  computer  possible,generally so who-ever wants to see
them  -  can.   But wait a moment,what if my true love Melissa Joan Hart
reads  my  articles and then stumbles upon the dreaded sex articles that
were once banned by the word!  Will she find me a slob of a man who only
has  sexual  desires  for  her  or will she find that my writing is of a
nature  that shows the man behind the keyboard as a caring gentlemen and
she admires me for my honesty about sex?

Anyway  if  your  reading  Missy,i`m  sorry if i offended you,but if you
didn`t mind then get in touch and let`s talk!

 Dear Dave

  I  actually  checked  out  a  program  recently  on Nickelodeon called
"Clarrisa" I believe starring this person of whom you keep referring to.
She  seems  a little young in this so we at The Word are starting to get
worried  about  you  and  are  glad  that  local schools are starting to
improve their security.
 This  besottedness  that  seems  to  be  occuring among guys today with
regards  to  female  TV personalities seems to be on the increase.  Dick
seems obsessed with Jenny Powell lately.  I told him she was on everyday
on  SKY (Coming Soon/HOT 11pm) and The Live Six Show but I haven't heard
from  him  since.   I'm expecting a pile of blank videos to arrive on my
doormat shortly or maybe he's gone off to subscribe to SKY?
 Gee..   I don't know.  Is there a cure for you guys?  By the way...  do
you think Sam Norman looks kinda cute?  ;)

we  had  to  take  him  into therapy,we wish to announce that he will no
longer be able to write anymore text in this article.

Thanks very much.

                          "To All Readers II"

Hello  again,just  a  quick  message to all mr Diamonds readers and fans
that  Dave  has  now left therapy and has found his "inner child" it was
apparently stuck behind the couch all this time.

From  our therapy studies we can now deduce that mr Diamond was mentally
ill from revealing too many torrid sex facts and fantasies from his mind
that  he  snapped completely and confessed that he actually gets paid by
chippendales to reveal to them how to pull women and how to woo.

Further  studies also revealed that mr Diamond was so wacky because "his
comfort  blanket  called  gog told him to" and that the whole world will
surrender to "gog" and the "wowies".

Mr  Diamond  is  now  well  and  on  his feet and should be back to work
writing articles soon and willn;:,fn"&gt;gn .:,


Jack: mr Diamond what are you doing???

Dave:   HI  FOLKS THE SEX MANIAC IS BACK,FORGET ALL THAT TRIPE THE QUACK
TOLD  YA  IT`S ALL LIES I TELLS YA GLPKGOK,DNLNL,NCFPKP;C,L'[L./-0]08I-4
GET OFFA ME WILL YA

Jack: quick hold him down

Dave: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, HAIL GOG!

Jack: come on mr Diamond,time for your medicine.

Dave: Mom,is that you?

 Dear Dr.J.Meback

 We've  sent  an  additional cheque and a bottle of pills for Dave.  His
mum  said  he  should  take them all at once.  I've taken the liberty of
removing  the  label  so  as  not to inconvience you with having to read
anything.

Thanks..
