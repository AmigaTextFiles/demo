Here's  another  one  of  my articles that contains various wibblings on
that don't warrant a seperate article each ....


<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>GIRLS/SLAPPERS/BINTS</CENTER></FONT></B>


My  view  of  girls  is  getting  worse everyday.  How come girls are so
stupid, boring and don't have a sense of humour?  For example, my sister
(she  falls  into  the slapper/bint catagory), she thinks stuff like Red
Dwarf  and Ace Ventura AREN'T funny!  The only females that I think that
have  a  sense  of  humour  are those two on LightLunch (on channel 4 at
12:35  weekdays)  -  now  THEY'VE  got a great sense of humour!  Say for
example, if someone in the audience fell out of their seat and fell down
the  stairs and twatted into a camera which in turn crashed into another
camera  and caused a huge bastard explosion and fried half the audience,
where  someone  had  a  home-made bomb in their bag which blew the whole
building to smeg and blew the next building up (which just happens to be
a  nuclear  reactor/H-bomb  factory) and caused the entire human race to
become extinct - a normal girl would say "I bet you think that's big and
clever, don't you?", but those two would laugh until their bowels made a
sudden movement and filled their knickers.

Anyway,  who cares if someone has said summat sexiest in a diskmag?  For
duck's  sake,  there's  hardly  any  girly  (oooh...   y'all  girls, not
"women"!)  readers  out  there,  is  there  (oh, apart from two that Kei
mentioned  in  issue  #13  - and they're probably skin-head lesbo's that
fondle theirselves with a spoon)?


<font color =#FFFF88>[Er... no. However I'll pass that on, along with your address. ;)  Kei]

<font color =#FFFFFF>
I  don't think girls should be chained to the kitchen sink, how the hell
would they reach the cooker?  And where'd you get your shaggage from??

A joke (one I like anyway):

There's a girl sat on her chair with a puddle underneath it ....

TEACHER: Why didn't you put your hand up??
GIRL   : I did, but it just trickled through my fingers!

<font color =#FFFFB8>                    [*I* told you that one! - D!ck]
<font color =#FFFFFF>
Now, THAT is funny, but what would a girl say?  "Yeah..  I bet you think
that's funny, don't you?" ARRGH!  YOU MARDY OLD BINT!

Also,  why  are they SO STUPID when it comes to pooters?!  They just say
that  it's "immature" and "for children"!  Have YOU tried to do an 8-way
multi-directional hardware scroll using HAM8 in one frame, eh?  EH?  Can
YOU  do a Tekken 3 beater using ARexx??  Do you actually KNOW what ARexx
is (apart from that chip shop near my house), eh?  EH?

[I  can  introduce  you  to  Barbara  that knows VMS like nobody I know,
Elizabeth  that  is a C++ WiZz, or one of our best University Techs whom
makes  me want to read every UNIX book ever written just to get near her
league!   There's also some female hackers on DEFCON/AAA which know more
about  computers  than  most  the guys I know!  Ever heard of Vamprella?
Open  your  eyes!   Computing ain't a male only past time no more!  Just
seems like that on the demo scenes.  Kei]

I  bet that Chloë Annett (Kochanski in Red Dwarf / Holly Turner in Crime
Traveller  to  all  you  ill-informed  shites  out  there) is a bit of a
japester (also amazingly sexy - oooh, that smile!  OH MATRON!) ...

   The only good thing a girly can do properly, is PISS BLOKES OFF!!
       (and try to lie that they DIDN'T use ALL the bog roll up!)
                 (although they're pretty good singers)

No,  not  that  dodgy  Austrailian thing, I'm talking those tossers that
live next door to you.

What  demented  old  piss-fart  thought that putting people next to each
other in big boxes would be a good idea?

My bedroom is next to a 12-year old fuckwit (their  "family"  (obviously
from  a  coucil  flat) moved in a few weeks ago, and have made our lives
hell)  who  absolutely insists on swearing at everyone in his family and
slamming  the  fooking  doors  (infact, they're all noisy bastards).  If
this little tosser keeps doing this, I'll hurt the little fucker.

          Fat bloke + Skinny shite = skinny red mess on floor.

If this little twat runs outside his house and shouts out "Joseph Cox is
a  fat  bastard" ever again, I'll grab his little fuckin' face and scrap
it against my pebble-dash wall.

Awww...   the little wanker goes to school (yeh, right), hummm...  looks
like  I'll  have to blast my stereo at about 1:30 in the morning?  Yeah,
why not!


<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>CHILDREN</CENTER></FONT></B>


I  have  got  NO  IDEA why people want these little wankers.  What gives
people  the  desire  to  spawn  these  little  fuckers?   They're noisy,
annoying,  vandalising, stupid little tossers.  Have you ever had one of
these  shites  stare  DIRECTLY  AT  YOU for minutes on end, without ever
BLINKING even ONCE ?  About a second ago, I decided that if one of these
little bundles of skin stare at me, I'll scare the twat shiteless!  When
it's  staring  at  you,  look directly at it and then move towards it at
about  398mph and shout "AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!".  That'll scare it.
Hopefully, it'll have an heart attack and implode.

One  way  of  stopping  it (without making it implode - it can get quite
messy  -  blood,  sick  and shite splattered all over the place, EURGH!)
staring  at  you is NOT to let it know that you've looked at it.  If you
make eye contact, it'll have you jammed in it's sights and never let go.

[I  love  the  power  of  being an editor, I get to do comments!  ;) You
forgot  to  mention that children happen when you opt to spend your last
quid on a Magnum lolly!  ;)  Kei]

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>CHANNEL 5</CENTER></FONT></B>


What  a  disappointment!   The opening was good (Spice Girls singing and
stuff,  Tim  Vine  &amp;  that gurl explaining what's gonna be on), but it's
just a channel that's full of AMERICAN SHIT!

<font color =#FFFF88>
[At  least you saw it!  We had loads of machines at a computer gathering
and  we turned them all off to see if they were interfering with the TV,
but no!  No reception here so have to view it on satellite.  Kei]
<font color =#FFFFFF>

At  about  10:00pm  there's  stand-up  and stuff which is very good, and
that's  about  it.   At  12:05am  there's summat called Live &amp; Dangerous
which  is  FULL of SHIT American SHIT!  Baseball, and BOLLOCKS like dat!
This channel is single-handedly made me hate Americans even more.

Okay,  so  it's only been only nearly a week, but it's not a good start,
is it?

       !?!? Also, why is the telly reception SO BLOODY CRAP !?!?

Ha  ha  ha!   What a furkun' JOKE!  They wibble on about not playing old
stuff  like  Tom  Jones,  but what do they do?  They play stuff that was
made just before the first wheel prototype was tested!!

The  only  good-ish  thing  is  Jay  Smith  ("In  The  Afternoon"),  but
everything else is pure SHiTE!

I  don't  want to offend anyone, but this is very annoying.  People that
say  "Why  don't you just code the best &lt;insert game genre here&gt; game on
the  Amiga?".   Why?   Coz it's NOT THAT EASY!  Like, the game I'm doing
(Derby),  I  think  it'd  be  a great game if I got it working the way I
wanted,  but the problem is, it needs shiteloads of maths code - which I
cannot  do!   Anyway, you cannot get a game like Tekken III on the Amiga
(well,  sure  you can get it to WORK, it'll be like watching a slideshow
or  using  a  fast raytracer) to run at a playable rate - even though it
WOULD be possible (D!ck, don't you even DARE say `owt about Quake!).

<font color =#FFFFB8>                  [What, Me?  Would I? &lt;smirk&gt; - D!ck]

<font color =#FFFF88>[Hey.. only I get to do the comments!! ;)  Kei]

<font color =#FFFFFF>
You can't just code summat in a matter of minutes/hours (well not summat
good  anyway),  y'know!   If  it  was THAT easy, don't you think someone
would have already done it??


<font color =#FFFF88>[Probably did, in AMOS but it needed to be spread on a Hard Drive.  Kei]

<font color =#FFFFFF>
For  example,  I  thought I had invented the best picture file-format on
ANY  computer  ANYWHERE!   It  could  get  a  400k  picture (or any size
picture, infact - as long as it's not in HAM format) down to 1,800 bytes
(or 9 bytes at a push!!  )!  But, it just didn't work!  If it did, don't
you  think  someone would have come up with it (as it was extremely easy
to do) ?

<font color =#FFFFB8>[Bugger, I wanted to grass you up on that... - D!]


<font color =#FFFF88>[Use a program called SEA on the PC to do this!  Kei]
