          BY DAVE "NO FUNNY QUIP THIS TIME" DIAMOND......DAMN

Just a short article this one folks,just to say that my articles can now
be  found  on various supporting bulletin boards around the world thanks
to my friend the Arab!

Never in my wildest dreams did i imagine that these articles would reach
the eyes of thousands...(?)

I  would  just  like to say to all those who read my articles and submit
them  to  disk-magazines  through-out  the  world that i`m glad you have
found these articles good enough to be printed in your fine magazines.

If anyone would like to contact me about article help such as...

HELP ME FIND SOME PUSSY
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE
WANTED!

Or  any  other  article where finding a way to contact melissa joan hart
personally  or  for any other reason,like to give me your opinions on my
articles  then  you  can do so by staying in touch with your supplier of
Diamond  Articles ltd as i will soon be having my very own email address
so you can contact me when-ever you like.

be too wise now would it!

Dave Diamond (the man himself).

[The  reason  your  articles are starting to appear on BBS's is probably
because  of  their  XXX content which seems to be a popular upload these
days  on  boards  struggling  for uploads.  As for your email address, I
have posted umpteen messages to it and have so far received no replies..
hmm.  Kei]
