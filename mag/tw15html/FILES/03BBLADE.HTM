                             BUSHIDO BLADE

Okay,  first  the  bad  news,  EVERYTHING  is in Japanese.  All the menu
entries,  options  screens,  character names, EVERYTHING.  That's due to
the fact it's only out in Japan at the moment.

The  next problem, You can't play character VS same character.  You also
can't  seem  to use the STORY costumes in VS mode, you're stuck with the
"classic" costumes, and vice versa.

Now  the  good news, this is the most innovative fighting game I've ever
seen.    The   control  system,  combat  engine  and  interplay  between
characters and the environment is completely unique.  You can't take any
skills  you've  learned  elsewhere and bring them to Bushido Blade, they
don't apply.

It  seems  basic  enough,  the  joypad moves you around in 3D.  The main
difference  is in the fighting style.  As with some other fighting games
you  have  a High, Medium and Low attack as well as a parray button.  On
top of that you also have three stances, High, Medium and Low.

Depending  on  which  stance  you  choose  will change all of your basic
attacks,  your  defense  options, your combos and what special moves you
can activate.

Each  character  has  two  special  moves,  their  own unique attributes
(speed,  strength,  etc)  and  a signature missile weapon (with it's own
attributes).Each  character  can  choose one of the eight basic weapons.
Each weapon has it's own special moves, combos, attributes and different
basic  attacks  depending  on the posture it's being used in (basically,
the weapon dictates your basic moves).

Additional  moves  you  can execute during combat include jumps, jumping
attacks, throwing your missile weapon (or your opponents, if you pick it
up  after they throw it), throwing a fistful of dirt into your opponents
eyes  (if  available),  climb a wall, execute running attacks, pounce on
downed  opponents,  drop  prone  to lessen damage from an attack, attack
while retreating, retrieve missile weapons or surrender to your opponent
if you are crippled from the fight.

You  have  no  life  meter, and there is no set amount of hits that will
kill you.  So far I've had fights that lasted up to fifteen minutes, and
fights that were over in less than two seconds.

In  the  story mode, you don't really have boundries to the combat area,
you  can  simply  run away from your opponent, up hills, across bridges,
through  bamboo  forests,  etc.   When  playing  by  yourself,  this  is
sometimes  enough  to  end the match, if you get enough distance between
yourself and the computer opponent.

As  you  fight,  the damage you take will affect your performance.  Your
character  will  slow  down, they may lose the use of their left arm (no
missile  weapons)  or  be  driven to their knees because of leg injuries
(difficult, but not impossible to win when this happens).  If you're not
careful,  your  character  might  simply  die  from  a single hit (being
stabbed  in  the  skull  with a broadsword is slighly fatal, even if the
match just began).

In story mode, damage you take is healed by the next match, but you have
bandages  over  the  wounds.  When two players are going at it for a few
rounds, you can get pretty battered looking.)

Combat  revolves  heavily around parrying, either actively or passively.
When  you  are  attacked,  you  will automatically deflect most incoming
attacks  (depending on your weapon), but be briefly stunned while you do
so.   If  you  use  the  parry button, you can actively bat any incoming
attack away, allowing you to immediately attack your opponent.

Parrying  is  easier  to  do than in any game I can remember, leading to
great  sequences  of  batting  each  others  weapons  trying  to find an
opening.   Get  used to parrying, it's often the only way to avoid fatal
blows.

The arena in this game are amazing.  There are bridges, canyons, rivers,
a waterfall, waist-deep pools of water, bamboo forests (you can even cut
the  bamboo  and  it'll fall!) and more.  I recommend playing story mode
with another human player and simply taking the grand tour.

In versus mode, you can only fight in small sections of the overall map,
but  some  of  these  areas don't seem accessible in story mode, so that
makes up for it somewhat.

Overall,  this  is  a  remarkably  unique game with a lot of interesting
features.   I have been waiting for so long to have a fighting game that
is based more on reallity than on fantasy.

I happen to love it so far, but I don't know how most fighting game fans
will  react.   It  takes a lot of getting used to, especially the "dying
with  one blow" bit.  Personally, I'm delighted with Bushido Blade.  All
I can say now is go buy it.
