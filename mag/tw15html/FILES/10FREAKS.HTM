A hard article to write about,it seems that whenever the subject appears
people cringe or don`t want to talk about it.  Well for me I think its a
subject  that  should  be discussed-after all they are part of our world
and  have equal rights and views just like me and you,its just that they
look  different.   Many different types of `freaks` have been uncovered,
from the bizare to the unbelievable, so lets have a look at just some of
them.

Perhaps the most famous freak is joseph carey merrick otherwise known as
the  elephant man.He was born on 5th august 1862 in leicester,his mother
was  a  cripple,the  family  home a slum and shortly after his birth was
abandoned  to  an  orphanage,he could speak but his appaling deformities
made  his  words barley intelligible.  It came to the day he was visited
by  the  princess of wales,the queen sent him christmas cards every year
with a message in her own handwriting.One night in april 1890 joseph was
found  dead in his bead.  `as a specimen of humanity,merrick was ignoble
and  repulsive;but the spirit of merrick,if it could be seen in the form
of  the  living,would  assume  the  figure  of  an upstanding and heroic
man,smooth  browed  and  clean  of  limb...and  with  eyes  that flashed
undaunted courage`.

That  above statement was taken from the book `the worlds most fantastic
freaks` and I think describes EVERY human being that has been through or
is still going through this terrible ordeal.

Other freaks (I really hate using that word) are:-

A  girl  called  alice  who  was  only  a  few weeks old when her mother
abandoned  her,as  alice  was  born  without a face,this was caused by a
terrible  birth  defect called bilateral cleft face,her eye lids were on
the  side  of  her  head but she had no eyes;where her mouth should have
been  there were only small holes opening into soft mucous membranes,she
had  severe  problems  in breathing-she could only be fed through a tube
inserted into her neck.  However good fortune came to alice as the nurse
who  cared  for  her  fell  in  love  with the child and legally adopted
her,the  last  that  was  heard,was  that  she  is  having  a sucessfull
operation  to repair her face at the age of 6 (please note that the book
is some 11 years old,it is unknown if the child is still living).

A  french  man  called  pascal pinon,40 had another smaller head growing
from  his  normal  one,the  head  had  all the normal features including
eyes,nose,mouth  and  brain-it  lived for four years until the human was
bitten  by a snake and died.I have a picture that shows the two heads if
anyones interested.

Others include...

A woman with 4 legs
The wolf boy
Lion man
A man with 108 inch nails
Human zombies

One facinating subject is the men and women who weigh over 500lbs, these
include  albert  who weighs 856lbs-thats 61 stone!!!  A woman at the age
of  23  weighed  456lbs-32 stone.  A man called bozo holds the title for
eating the quickest,apparently he can

Eat a pound of cheese in I minute 13 seconds
22 meat pies in 18 minutes
62 pancakes in 58.5 seconds
3 pounds of potatoes in I minute 22 seconds
14 hard boiled eggs in 58 seconds
32 soft boiled eggs in 78 seconds
13 raw eggs in 2.2 seconds
40 jam sandwiches in 53.9 seconds

There are many more that I haven`t added,suits his name doesn`t he?!

The  record  for  eating  the  most  goes  to  frenchman  lotito who was
nicknamed  monssieur mangetout (mr eat all) who in 15 days between march
and  2  april  1977 consumed an entire bicycle,eating the frame as metal
filings and stewing the tyres.

The point i`m trying to make with this article isn`t to gross out people
but  to  make them think-these people just look different and if you say
the`re  ugly  and  wouldn`t  give  them  the  time  of day then you`re a
rascist,its   only   because   these  people  are  hidden  that  we  are
affraid-just like menatlly handicapped people,they used to be laughed at
and  hidden and I suppose some still are,but they are much more accepted
than they used to be.

WHATS  THE  SOLUTION?   well I think that these people should be brought
out into the open,to get proper jobs,to go into shops and not be laughed
or gawped at-I know this would be hard as if someone is different people
will  look,but  if  we  give them a chance (WHICH WE SHOULD) then they`d
become our friends and would be accepted by society.

In the book fantastic freaks the introduction says it all and will close
the subject of this article.

`They  are  loved,loathed,feared,despised  and  even  worshipped;  human
beings  whose  appearances  and natures often conspire to defy that very
description.We   call   them  freaks.We  have  exhibited  them,exploited
them,applauded  them,laughed  at  them  and,sometimes,shut them far away
from the world.

But  human  beings  they  are.The  short,the  tall,the fat,the thin, the
mighty,the  feeble,the  grotesque  and  the  downright outrageous;people
thrust into a prying,probing limelight because they are different.

Yet  what lies behind the peep show curtains?  Behind the sober, medical
textbooks and the screaming newspaper headlines?  Since history began to
be   chronicled,no-one   has   captured  public  curiosity  in  all  its
manifestations of emotion as much as the human freak`.
