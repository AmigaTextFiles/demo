                            Written by D!ck

Anyone  who's into nude celebs on the internet will know that 90% of the
nude celebrity sites are actually pay-to-view, that is, you have to give
your  credit  card details and the runner of the site charges you around
10 dollars a month to access the page.  Offset this against what you pay
for your net access anyway and you might find that you're paying as much
again for the celebs.

A  friend  came  to  me  (We'll  call  him  The Doctor) with the idea of
starting a completely free Nude Celebs site, we spent a while looking at
possibilities  and  then  he  bought a Hauppage WinTV card to do our own
grabs  with, that kind of swung our decision and so we're now creating a
site that comprises all out own captures.

You've  seen  a fit babe in a movie, of you know that a certain star has
appeared  nude,  pay a visit to our site and chances are you'll find the
image  on  there,  especially if it has been n TV recently.  Quite often
you'll find the image is better than you've seen on your TV, because the
grabber we use is not bordered like your TV screen.

For  example,  look  at  your Channel 5 picture, you'll see that the gap
around  the  logo  (above and to the left) is about half the logo width.
If  we  were to grab that screen then there would be a lot more image to
see,  the  gap  around the logo would be more like three quarters of the
logo width or more.

We  also  boost the incoming signal to improve the image stored on video
tape, because stronger signals give a more defined image.  When grabbing
straight from the TV our images are second to none.

We present these images in two ways:  While we only have a few images of
a  certain celebrity we will put only two or three of the very best ones
onto  the  web  page;  when  we get enough we compile all these and more
images of the celeb into a montage, and put that on the web page.

Our  pages  are  pretty  spartan, most of the graphics are created to be
less than one "packet" in size, we aim for sub-2k thumbnails (while they
are  still 50x50 pixels) and coordinated backdrops.  Everything we do is
done  and  redone until we are happy with it, and then we'll say that we
are unhappy with something and look for ways of improving it AGAIN.

The  end result is a very polished site that, with a 33.6 modem and at a
relatively  low net load, should present you with a fully-loaded page in
under 30 seconds, and STILL LOOK GOOD!

One problem we're having is finding an ISP who isn't going to charge the
earth to host this site.  We are applying the same rigourous checking to
this  as we are to the details of our site, and while we are down to the
last  two  options,  we  are  still  researching  ways  to make the page
download quicker and with less graphical hits.

It is our intention to seek sponsorship through advertising to keep this
site  free,  for the sake of a couple of adverts - less than 10k in size
and  probably  more  like 5k - you should be able to enjoy access to the
site  with no charges whatsoever.  In the event that we overrun our hits
limit  we  may  have  to charge, current thinking indicates that if this
were the case we could get away with charging only £5 per YEAR, compared
with $10 per month from out competitors.

However, we're working on that...

The only other limit is the size of the site.  When we first start it is
quite  possible that we will only have 10Mb to play with.  While this is
certainly  enough  to start the site and run it at a high level, it does
not give us the room to make it into the be-all and end-all site that we
would prefer, but again, we're working on that.

Visit the page, it's located at:

                http://ds.dial.pipex.com/limelight/bsc/

Suggested browser screen width is 800 pixels, although it will [a] still
be fine in 640 and [b] look cool in 1024, but we designed it with 800 in
mind.   All  major  browsers  should  have  no  problems as long as they
support Frames, Forms and Image Maps.  Make sure you sign the guest book
and ONLY Bookmark the front page, as sub-page names are likely to change
as we expand.
