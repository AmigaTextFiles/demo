             scream @ plymouth warehouse / stlg12! / a few
             saturdays ago

Decided  to go clubbing on a non student, free entry, watered down pints
for 50p and mediocre dj type night, and splash out on the real thing.

Due  to  the steep entry price, there are more serious clubbers and less
piss  heads.   By "serious clubbers" I mean that the babes are even more
ludicrously dressed in the next to nothings.  2000 people there too.  So
that makes about 1000 girls.  Minus 250 trogs = 750 Babes!  Nice!

The  club  was  also tarted up quite a bit.  Although I enjoy the grubby
atmosphere  on Student nights, it made a nice change.  There were Scream
logos  projected  everywhere  and it looked a lot cool.  The dj was also
moved  from  his  usual  perch  in  a  tacky  mirror tiled egg, to prime
position  up  on  the stage, with close up of his decks projected on the
video  screen,  although it got a bit boring compared with the usual mix
of computer gfx, games, and cartoons.

The  lights  were  awesome.   Not content with the usual array of bright
things,  extra ones were stuck all over the show, and not cacky computer
controlled ones either.  They have proper lighting blokes.  Chufties!

Carl  Cox  did  a  2  hour  set  from 12.00-2.00.  It was pretty awesome
dj-wise,  but the music was little too hardcore techno-ey for my tastes,
I  prefer  more  housey  stuff.  But he did a good job and got the crowd
going mental.  The other djs were about as average as the come.

The  Warehouse sound system was up to its usual high standards.  That is
booming  bass,  ear  shattering trebble, you can't hear yourself scream,
and it takes 2 days before your ears stop ringing :)

So, to sum up, it was a cool night, but not quite my taste in music.
Hmm.
