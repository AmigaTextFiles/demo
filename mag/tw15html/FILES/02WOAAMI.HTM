<font color =#884C4C>                            + By Amida/Crn +


<font color =#FFFFB8>
  The  show  was staged at Hammersmith, London from Saturday 17th of May
towards  the 18th.  A very big day for any Amiga user would have dreamed
of!

  The  Word  14 was also complete and works 100% from the day of release
at  The  World of Amiga Show.  Several copies of The Word 13+14 were put
onto floppy and backup copies on to my laptop.  They were distributed to
CUAmiga,  Weird Science, Sadeness PD and to be forwarded to Amiga Format
by email.
<font color =#7C4C64>
To Novotel Hotel
================
<font color =#FFFFB8>
  To  travel from Turnpike Lane to Hammersmith required 19 stops through
the underground tube system, Kei and myself sat comfortably whilst I was
reading text articles from my laptop.

Once  stopped at Hammersmith station we made our way towards subways and
bits'n  bobs.   On the way we noticed passerbys carrying bags with boxes
of  software  inside them.  We were also given directions to the Novotel
exhibition  centre  as there were no visible signposts or any indication
to  aid  our  path towards the hotel.  Whether there were signs or not -
they were un helpful (like the one I saw after leaving the show).

But  soon  we  arrived at a tall building and beneath were coaches which
passes through a tunnel.  There were multiple entrances to the building,
unfortunately the correct one wasn't so easy to find!

We  made  our  way  through the entrances where friendly security guards
stamped our tickets and people walking in, out and about the area.

My  presence  over the other side of the barriers almost felt like being
in  Heaven  (through  the gates of Heaven)!  We both had access to a map
which shows in detail the locations of every stand.

The  area  was  completely  crowded  with people everywhere!  We entered
through  the  barriers  and  I  looked  took  my  first  glance, feeling
astonished  that  there  was  an  Amiga  sitting  on a table!  I had the
surprise   because   I've   been  to  so  many  shows,  exhibitions  and
conferences,  even  through TV, everything you see is made up of pcs and
business  people  in  suit'n  tie  boring you to death!  Most exhibitors
attend  these  shows  mainly  for  their  own  businesses  but  also for
freebees.   But  this  Amiga  show  is  far  different  to all that I've
experienced.   People whos been 100% dedicated to Amigas for a long time
and  continue  using  their  Amiga.   An  Amiga  community that has this
special  link.  There's no other platform that gains more trust than the
Amiga.  You would need to own an Amiga to understand the feeling.

Anyway...   Kei  and  myself  have visited the stands:  Sadeness, AF, CU
AMIGA  to  deliver  The Word 14.  We've been through talks with the guys
incharge  of  their  depot.  Telling them exactly who we are, what we do
and so on.





<font color =#7C4C64><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Interesting sites</CENTER></FONT></B>



Genlock display
===============
<font color =#FFFFB8>
We   saw   fasinating  displays  of  a  Genlock  (video  mixer)  running
concurrently with a standard normal WB.  TV and Amiga video signals were
fed  into  the  Genlock which to be diaplayed on a large TV screen.  The
effect  was like using normal WB but as if a TV was playing as a part of
the  backdrop.   They  said  it  was  only  a prototype and no price was
announced.


<font color =#7C4C64>Another portable workstation?
=============================
<font color =#FFFFB8>
At  the  far  corner  of  CU  Amiga  stood portable A600 made completely
different  to  the  PAWS  (U.S.).   A  self  assembled unit by different
manufacturers.   Its  the  first time I've ever come across this system.
The  appearance  looked  OK  in  its shape and the black case but it was
almost 5 inches deep which seemed big!  It came equipped with glidepoint
and  mono  LCD display.  There was little detail that I could find about
the machine depsite being over crowded.

TFX was displayed towards my right.  It didn't seem as good as expected.
It  could  at  least  be  run  on  a super charged A1200 now it has that
ability!


<font color =#7C4C64>The EX-CBM Chair
================
<font color =#FFFFB8>
At  the  PowerComputing stand we came across David Pleasance who used to
run CBM UK.  Although David has nothing to do with PowerComputing he was
only  using  their  space  to  sell  used  Amigas.  On the counter was a
discoloured  look alike A4000/040 with 16bit sound card, CD32, an A3500T
on  the  floor  and on the shelf was a golden A500 with a certificate to
certify that it was the one millionth Amiga ever made and is for sale.


<font color =#7C4C64>Hisoft
======
<font color =#FFFFB8>
Hisoft  was  displaying  one  of its many products.  One of them was the
Squirrel  Mpeg  which  played back a Video CD onto a screen.  The device
was  much  smaller  than  I expected (even through past brochures).  The
device  works which any SCSI CDROM drive - speed is not a factor as VCDs
can  only play up to a maximum and default FPS.  I questioned especially
about  the  leads  &amp; cables to connect to a VGA monitor.  Yes there is a
Scart  adaptor output to VGA monitor.  For Playstation owners who wishes
to  connect  their  Playstation  to a VGA monitor, that is only half the
answer.   Theres three items you need:  A cable to connect from the PS's
AV/Video  output  to  Male  Scart  (easy to find).  That Scart (Male) to
15Pin  VGA-D  cable  (used  in  the  Squirrel Mpeg) - contact Hisoft for
details.    Now   you're   left  with  a  problem!   You  would  need  a
Double-Female  Scart  to  Scart adaptor (gender changer) to connect both
the  Male  -  Male Scart.  I can't see why this won't work!  And whether
your  monitor  can  handle  PAL/NTSC  its  another  question.  Abt.  the
adaptor  you  can  try Maplin Electronics...  (A supplier that could not
supply  me with any cables I want!  They've not even come across a 23pin
cable!)


<font color =#7C4C64>Amiga Format
============
<font color =#FFFFB8>
The  Amiga  Format  stand,  not surprisingly was busy as ever.  The main
editor of the mag.  was present managing with people.....


<font color =#7C4C64>Phase V
=======
<font color =#FFFFB8>
The  Phase  V  stand was small but big in attracting people's attention.
On  the hardware side we saw an A4000T with an empty case just so people
can  see the interior designs of the new RISC.  This Amiga was connected
to  a 17" AMIGA cool looking monitor.  The WB display was in 1024x768 in
possibly  24bit  colour.   The  WB set up as you can tell was using some
sort  of  Hi-spec  WB  interfacing.   A Mandlebrot window is visible.  I
questioned  the  guy who was giving the demonstration, asking him of the
full  details  of the machine.  It was an A4000T using RISC 604e@200Mhz,
MC-060  CPU  situated on board and 128MB RAM!  A Cybervision 64/3D video
card  was  also  in  use  which  helps  with  the display resolution and
colours.   I  then  asked  him  for a run through of a demonstration.  A
requestor  was  opened giving a list of Mpegs &lt;filename.mpg&gt;.  I saw the
requestor  listing  Mpegs  which  I  thought  seems quite reasonable for
conducting  a  speed test.  He then opened another window and clicked on
some  gadgets.  And the way it goes...  I stood still in silence and was
totally  stunned on what I saw!  I couldn't believe what I saw was true!
Well however I was standing directly in front of the monitor!

The compressed MPEG anim was being played back in REAL-TIME in the Amiga
backdrop,  concurrently  with  the  overlay  of  the  WB icons!  At full
1024x768  at  full  frame  rate,  smooth,  unbelievable!  The mandlebrot
window  was set to render using in many zooms, it was rendered instantly
without  you  knowing!   Yes  whilst  the  Mpeg was still playing in the
backdrop.   No  slow  down  whatsoever you can't even see the mandlebrot
being  redrawn.   I  was almost letting out in tears of total amazement!
I've  not  seen  a  machine  that  can match this level of capability in
real-time computing.  This was like the BEST computer in the World!

Shortly  after  a  while  I looked around and a crowd of spectators were
watching  in total amazment, I then slowly left the stand to give them a
chance to view the best computer in the world.

Anyone  whos  attended  the show will have come across this Super Amiga!
Its  time to show this to a pc user and make them eat their words on the
negative points they've once said about the Amiga.  :)

But  also  it  was  from this moment that many PC owners have now become
converted to Amiga.  :)


<font color =#7C4C64>Amiga International
===================
<font color =#FFFFB8>
The  AMIGA International stand was situated at the centre of all stands!
The  AMIGA logo was tiled up to the ceiling.  It was basically the heart
of  the  show,  there  were  companies standing aside like Micronik with
their  Tower A1200/A4000 featuring Cybervison cards that can handle very
Top  resolution  displays!   I was then spending some time familiarising
myself  in using this top-spec Amiga.  The usage has a more professional
feel  than  my current A4000 (which needs upgrading in the future).  The
speed  at  which  backdrops  are  interpreted  by the Cybervision 64 and
transferred  onto the screen is very fast (considering they were jpegs).
I checked the amount of total RAM which comes to another 128MB!!!

The opportunity to even use these TOP END Amiga for the first time feels
very special.  Escpecially the massive A4000T (first time I've ever seen
in reality).

There  were free mouse mats which were specially AMIGA branded, they had
AMIGA  printed  in  red italics.  Amiga stickers were also available for
grabs.  Its not surprising how many of these mouse mats and sticker have
been  taken from the point they've been restocked!  There were also free
mice  -  they  were coloured in black and AMIGA logo printed on them.  I
presumed they were designed to be used for the Walker.


<font color =#7C4C64>Worms
=====
<font color =#FFFFB8>
Towards the back of Amiga Int.  we met the guy (can`t remember his name)
who was giving away posters with his own autographs signed on them.  The
posters  shows  the  upper  part of a woman with WORMS printed above the
left  breast.  The guy himself was infact the person who coded Worms for
the Amiga.  Another special greeting or what?  Nice to meet him...


<font color =#7C4C64>EPIC
====
<font color =#FFFFB8>
A  stand  selling  loads  of PD CDs had this garbage, rusted/disused and
abandoned  looking pc tower in the near corner (as if ready to be thrown
out),  it  was  tilted at an angle with one of the 5/25 bays missing and
another  bay  below  saying "Post here".  Next to it was a pile of paper
which  people  were  filling  in  to ask "What do you think P.C.  stands
for?",  and the person with best idea wins £100.  Theres entries for you
to  fill  in  your name and address incase you do win, otherwise they'll
send  a  notification  on who the winner(s) is/are.  I put down "Pile of
Crap" as what I thought what P.C.  stands for.


<font color =#7C4C64>Press Conference
================
<font color =#FFFFB8>
The  press  conference  had already took place the day before we attened
the  Show.   The talks between Gateway and Amiga Int.  on very important
issues  of  its  future...   The talks and speeches can be heard in this
month's CUAmiga cover CD.  You might possibly find photo shots of Kei or
myself during the show.


<font color =#7C4C64>Digita
======
<font color =#FFFFB8>
We  stood at Digita, Kei questioned about Personal Paint v7.1 where as I
questioned if this Black and white Digita mouse mat was for free or not,
so  it  wasn't (costing £1) so I left to try another location.  Near the
entrance was a table full of use/diused/abandoned mice piled to a level.
I asked if they're free but they were also £1 each!



<font color =#7C4C64>Various
=======
<font color =#FFFFB8>
We  came across Siemese Twin - and a small seminar was held where people
gathered  and  listened  to talks.  And apparantly the PC GFX video card
being used to power the Amiga's graphics.

There were other stands with an A3000UX (Unix based Amiga) running Unix,
theres  A4000  keyboards on counters where the cases are hidden.  Theres
glass windows where you can see how A1200s are slotted into the pc Tower
cases.   Blittersoft  was well crowded as they will be the first guys to
sell  the  PPC  boards  and  they  have the rept.  for bringing out cool
products.

There  were  assistants  being very busy serving customers, they go back
and  forth  as we saw.  Girls wearing white T-shirts in red print "First
For  AMIGA".   Guys  wearing  "I  LUV  MY  AMIGA", theres so many people
wearing Amiga T-shirts in different variety.


<font color =#7C4C64>Finally

Here is a list of companies and vendors that have attended:

                           Amida Internatonal
                            Direct Software

                          Wizard Developments
                              Siemese Twin
                                Eyetech
                                  Epic

The  list  were  only  names that I could remember.  However, there were
much  more  but  they  were  European companies and others which I can't
remember by name.  Many companies were PD companies and others were just
selling hardware accessories (disks, labels etc.)

There  are other Amiga, The Word and misc.  related areas that I haven't
discussed  in  detail.   If you haven't already done so please check out
Kei's update about the Show.


<font color =#7C4C64>Well...
=======
<font color =#FFFFB8>
Altogether  its  been  an  excellent day out!  And the best day I've had
since  coming  down  to London!  Its been phun working again with Kei on
The Word and its been a completely different experience once visited the
show.  No doubt that everyone will have gained this similar and valuable
experience from the show.

The  show  was  worth  every  money  that  was spent on the ticket (well
considering that I actually live in London - transport and accessibility
is never a problem).

Thanks for reading! :)

Amida.
