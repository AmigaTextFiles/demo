Kenco  here.  Hehe, just read through some of The Word 14.  It's nice to
see  so  much variety in the articles.  Those quizzes were 'kin 'ard!  I
thought  I  knew  a  fair  bit about Great A'Tuin's Four heffalumps, the
Discworld  and  its inhabitants.  But, I didn't.  And also, what kind of
question is "How many mice watched the rocket blast off?" Eh?  You what?
I know it's in A Grand Day Out, but...  eh?  Those were buggeringly hard
questions!!  Now, onto something else...

I recently took up driving lessons, seeing the need to throw myself upon
an  unsuspecting  mobile public.  Well, the first couple of lessons were
okay,  I  managed  gear-changing, clutch-control, reversing, junctions..
all the basic stuff, then the inevitable happened..

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Yup, I'm going to die</CENTER></FONT></B>



It  got  "a  bit  tougher" as I was introduced to "real traffic".  Urm..
well,  everything went okay.  Ish.  Roundabouts.  Now there's a thing to
behold.   "Fair  enough", I thought.  I know where I'M going.  I'VE read
it  in  the  Highway Code, and everything.  Urm..  well, I got it right,
eventually.  It really was quite amazing that I, nor any other road user
in  a  100-yard  radius,  didn't  hit anything.  The other road-users, I
think,  were  aware of my driving capabilities due to the pyramid on top
of  the  roof.   (By the way, how does that stay on?  Does it have a big
magnet  in it or something?) Then there was my unerring ability to speed
up  While  Going  Round The Corners, much like a scene from the Dukes of
Hazzard.   Then  there  was  the  problem  with  setting  the  gas,  the
accelerator  is Very Sensitive, so only a "light tap" revs the engine up
so  much I thought we were going to take off.  But it's starting to pull
together now.  A bit.  I'm starting to recognise where i should be doing
things, like slowing down BEFORE you come to the junction.

Anyone  wishing  to  take up driving lessons, I'd advise it.  It's great
fun.   Honest.   Yeh,  go  and  pay  someone  loads  of money for, quite
literally,  the Ride of Your Life.  The first time it's "quite exciting"
as  everything's  new, but when your introduced to real traffic, it gets
very daunting.

Well, I'm off. I've got a driving lesson tomorrow.

[Don't  worry about it.  It took me 3 goes to pass.  First time I failed
for  speeding  and  the  second  time  I  failed  because I went over an
unmarked crossroads in a housing estate.  My mates all passed first time
and  they've  all  had accidents!  I was the passenger in one as we came
off  a  main  road  at 60mph and crashed into a field and rolled several
times.   I was in intensive care for a while and it wasn't pleasant with
all  those  f'ing  tubes  going  in my arms.  Hope I haven't put you off
driving.    ;)   It's   cool  though  especially  tripping  through  the
countryside in my classic car.  Kei]
