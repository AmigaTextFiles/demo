1.  Sir, your eyebrows are shaved!
2.  Take my advice or I'll spank you without pants.
3.  I am damn unsatisfied to be killed in this way.
4.  What is soul?  It's just a toilet paper.
5.  How can you use my intestines as a gift?
6.  Suck the coffin mushroom now.
7.  What you need is a canned woman.
8.  Noodles?  Forget it!  Try my fist!
9.  Sex fiend, you'll never get reincarnated!
