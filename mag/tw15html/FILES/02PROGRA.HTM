 Everyone seems to be still arguing about AMOS so I figured I'd put my 2
cents worth into the pot.
 Programming  a  computer can be fun or a hassle, it all depends on you.
If  you  have  this  really  great idea in your head for a game or small
intro  and  you  have only coded in Speccy BASIC or AmigaBASIC then AMOS
shouldn't  be  much trouble for you.  To me, it's a quick fix for anyone
wanting to code an idea NOW!
 I  remember reading an article a while back saying that AMOS was a lazy
man's  language  and  I agree but it is useful!  If you have an idea you
want  to  code  then  AMOS  is  almost  like speaking to the computer in
english.
 Back  in  1992 there were 3 of us in CyberDreams and only 2 of us could
code.   We  used  AMOS  because  it  was easy to master and you could do
pretty  much  anything  with  it.   However it has disadvantages such as
extraordinarily  large files once compiled, but you could load the music
modules  and images into it (banks) so you ended up with one file and if
you used it's own compressor it was a bugger to rip stuff from it!
 You  tend  to get stuck in a rut though where churning out stuff is all
to  easy and design and looks begin to suffer as the average development
process is 2 hours to a day on average.  AMOS makes life too easy.
 I  gave up AMOS when my group started getting better coders.  This gave
me  more time to mess with graphics and ascii art.  However because I've
spent  most  of  my  time  after school in further education I have come
across  a  host  of  other languages.  I'll give you my views on those I
coded in (and some I still do) below.  These are my own viewpoints.

Not  asembler!   Assembler  is  lines  of  code  such as "move.b #FF,D0"
whereas  this  was  stuff  like  "0A  02"  where  0A  could be LDA (Load
Accumulator) etc..  It's been a while since I've done this but from what
I  can  remember,  you  dry ran your program on paper then converted the
mnemonics  to hex values, entered them into the computer and tested them
by  doing  trace  steps.   The  computers we used back then were Hewlett
Packard suitcase models (3K) and Eliza and Visa project computers.

 I  hated  having  to  learn  this  language.   This  was one of the few
languages  I  taught  myself  at  first by using a book (Abacus book 4 I
think).   It  was  a slow and tedius process and was basically a case of
moving data around and adding values.  I mainly coded some CLI hacks and
a  couple  of  GUI  programs  which  was  a  bitch.  Ever tried teaching
yourself  how  to  use  intuition?   When you do you'll know what I'm on
about.
 At  university some years later we used Sun Sparcs (UNIX) running cross
emulators  (68000)  to  code  in  assemler.   Some  instructions are not
portable  to  the Amiga such as the TRAP instruction.  It causes a guru!
I  learned  a  bit  more  and went back to assembler at home on my (now)
A1200.   Attempted  some  68020  specific  code but wasn't too impressed
after I'd used up 2 hours coding something that would of took 30 seconds
in  AMOS.   However the difference between the AMOS and ASM programs was
45k  (both  uncrunched)  so  I  can  see  the advantages if you have the
patience.   Coding programs like TYPE and DELETE is easy but an intro...
I'll  leave  that  to  those  with a couple of years of assembler coding
under their belts!

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>BASIC and varients</CENTER></FONT></B>



 BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was the closest
thing  you  could  get  to  english before 4GLs were created.  I started
coding  in  this  on  my  Spectrun  48k+ because after a while games got
boring,  especially if you had ran out of pocket money and had completed
most  games  in your collection.  You started off (well I did) by typing
in those game sources from books untill you got familiar with the syntax
and  you  could write your own programs.  Saving to cassette seemed easy
at the time but I'll keep my floppies nowadays thank you!
 AmigaBASIC was a bitch.  I hated it so I never really bothered with it.
There  was  about  3  different BASICs on the PC as I recall.  I used to
code  in one many years ago (GFW?/GFA?) but I don't have any source left
to use to recall the syntax.
 AMOS  took  a  few days to master (I sent off for the Amiga Format book
and  disks  for  £13.95  way  back when).  If you wanted a picture to be
displayed  you would load it in:  LOAD IFF "df0:pic1.iff",0 then pack it
to  a  bank and when you wanted to display in your program:  UNPACK 5 TO
0.   Simple.   However  I was using v1.34 at the time and it insisted om
saving  this 48k library file with every program I wrote so if you coded
a "Hello World" program it would be about 50k or more!

 PASCAL  is not far from BASIC to be honest.  It's designed to teach you
how to code in a structured way.  I did this on one of those TFW courses
some  years  ago.   You had to follow a 4 week syllabus which I did in a
week.   I then coded some snazzy effects and fractal generators and quiz
games  because  screen manipulation was so easy.  I think you typed USES
CRT  or something with TURBO PASCAL.  I ported my programs to my A500 at
the time using Hisoft Pascal.  Slightly similar to TURBO PASCAL.
 PASCAL-FC  is  a  real-time  PASCAL  language for the PC and UNIX based
machines.   It's  designed  for  use  on single or multi-processor based
systems  like  UNIX  and  allows  you  to protect shared resources using
semaphores  and  monitors  to  provide  a  condition  known  as  "Mutual
Exclusion".  Not advisable to any non-degree students.

Ever  tried  learning french?  Have you ever heard a french person speak
english  then?   Yes?  Do you know how they get things backwards and say
things  like "I am good.  Yes?".  Well FORTH is like that, everything is
backwards  and  you have to turn your mind inside out to think in FORTH.
The  source compiles down pretty well but it's so annoying to think this
way  when  there  are easier higher level languages available.  I barely
passed my project in this!

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>COBOL</CENTER></FONT></B>



This  was  a  2nd year degree option and it sounded real easy so I chose
it.  Boy was I wrong!  It was so boring that it held no interest for me.
The syntax is laid out like a book where you have the contents page then
the  chapters.   You  declared everything several times at the top using
levels  like  01,03,05,88 etc..  then you would have procedures etc.  It
was like an english text file but long winded and directly aimed at guys
in suits who think spreadsheets kick ass!  This was an experience I want
to forget!  If you don't wish to end up a suit programming databases for
the rest of your life then avoid COBOL!  COBOL compilers are named after
the  year  they  were  introduced  so  you  get compilers like COBOL-77,
COBOL-85 and COBOL-90.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>C and varients</CENTER></FONT></B>



 I  first  came  across C on that TFW course I mentioned above.  We used
Turbo  C  and  it  was easy to jump from Turbo Pascal to Turbo C as they
used the same interface and the syntax was similar.  You could even load
in  some  PASCAL  source  and  edit  it into C by changing commands like
WRITELN  into  PRINTF  and  READLN  into  SCANF.  Simple!  At home on my
computer I tried using Lattice C v5 but it wasn't the same.
 At  university we started doing ISO C.  This is the very standardised C
that  has  been  agreed upon by the International Standards Organisation
(ISO).  ISO C is portable to most machines.  I found I could use Turbo C
on  my  PC to code a routine and port it to my Amiga using SAS C v6.  If
machine  specific  code  was  then needed I'd code it seperately on each
machine.
 Now comes the bastard of all C languages, C++.  Also known as an Object
Orientated  Programming  language (OOP).  I had to do this as part of my
degree  and  believe  me,  it  is  a right pain in the butt!  First off,
instead  of  using  the  old  #include  &lt;stdio.h&gt;  for  PRINTF and SCANF
statements,  you use #include &lt;iostream.h&gt; because files are now streams
and  data  flows to and from them.  So an output command looks something
like  COUT&lt;&lt;"Hiya  World  "&lt;&lt;1234&lt;&lt;endl; Fun?  Not really.  It does have
some uses like hiding and protecting data and once you get to grips with
classes  and  .h  files  you  can use existing  objects created by other
programers like "time.h".

 I've coded in many languages over the years that I've forgotten most of
it.   I  find  that  if I do not have a use for it outside of education,
then  after  the  course  is over (and I hopefully passed it), I'll move
onto  something  else.   I  do  sometimes  find  some uses for languages
though.   I  can  still code in PASCAL and PASCAL-FC as they are usefull
for  coding  little  programs  for UNIX.  I still code in C on my Amiga.
I've  coded  some  Workbench  hacks and I'm slowly replacing some system
commands on my A1200 so it feels like the Amiga but has the best of UNIX
and  PC commands as well (ie MOVE, LS, RM..).  I also code in C on my PC
(Turbo C and Borland C++ 4.51).
 I  use  SQL (4GL) at university still at present but have no real plans
in   continuing   to  use  this  database  script  language  outside  of
university.   I use HTML for creating web pages and I believe in the 4th
year of my degree course I also get to code in PERL and JAVA in order to
do some CGI.

 The  choice  of  a  programming language should reflect the reasons you
wish  to  code.   If  you only want to code on your Amiga then languages
like AMOS, BLITZ and Amiga E are ok.  However if you want to be employed
as a programmer then C is the most used language in the commercial world
followed  by COBOL in the business and industrial world.  Some companies
have  varients or 4GLs such as NOKIA which uses a language roughly based
on  C.  They may require you to know C before they take you on and train
you in their "in-house" language.
 Assembler is not portable no matter what you have heard.  It is CPU and
architecture specific.  What I mean is that if you code for the Amiga in
assembler  it  won't  work  on  the  PC  as Intel assembler and Motorola
asembler  are  very  different (especially with register use), hence CPU
specific,  and your 68000 based Amiga assembler will not work on a 68000
based   Apple   Mackintosh  computer  because  the  way  the  CPU's  are
implemented  is different, hence architecture specific.  You cannot beat
assembler  for getting speed out of a machine but portability is not one
of it's advantages.
 C  on  the other hand is very portable, especially ISO.  It tends to be
backwards  compatible as well.  For instance C++ allows you to still use
the old C standard libraries like "stdio.h" but it would prefer you used
the OOP based ones.
 If  like  me,  you own Amiga's and PC's then try C as it's very easy to
port code between machines.  Otherwise, work out what you wish to do now
and  in  the  future  and which computers you'll be coding on, then make
your choice.
 Depending  on  who  you  listen  to,  by  the time you come to choose a
language,  some  people  say  JAVA will be the lanuage everyone uses and
others  say  it  will be DELPHI or some other 4GL.  Your best bet if you
haven't already started to learn a language is to teach yourself PASCAL,
then  C  and then an OOP language like C++.  If you want to code for the
Amiga,  everyone  seems  to be recommending Amiga E these days, even the
assembler coders!
