Caretaker (Premier Episode)


Parallax

The  Starship  Voyager encounters a quantum singularity and what appears
to  be another ship in jeopardy.  In their attempt to rescue the vessel,
the  crew comes to realize that it is they who are trapped, and the race
begins to free themselves before the ship is destroyed.


Time and Again

The  Starship  Voyager experiences a shock wave in space, a wave set off
by  a  huge  explosion  on  a  nearby  planet.   When  they beam down to
investigate,  the  away team discovers all life has been eradicated.  In
addition,  they  discover  subspace fractures which ultimately transport
Captain  Janeway  and  Lt.   Paris  back  in  time  to  right before the
explosion.   They  must  discover a way to avert the catastrophe to save
their lives.


Phage

In their continuing search for a source of dilithium crystals that could
be used to supplement the Voyager's power core, the crew of the Starship
come  upon  a planet that seems replete with the substance.  Upon closer
examination,  they  find  that  the place is really a base for a strange
alien  culture  that  must  steal  bodily organs to fight the "phage," a
disease  that  eats  away  at  their  bodies  and destroys their organs.
Neelix  (Ethan  Phillips) falls prey to them, and the race is on to save
his life.


The Cloud

While  investigating what they believe to be a nebula in search of fuel,
the crew of Voyager discovers that they have in fact entered and injured
a new life form, which they must help heal as they try to escape.


Eye of the Needle

The  Voyager  crew  becomes hopeful when they encounter a small wormhole
through  which they communicate with a cargo vessel on the other side...
in the Alpha Quadrant.


Ex Post Facto

Upon  visiting  a world in the midst of a war with a neighboring planet,
Lt.   Tom  Paris  finds  himself accused of a murder he didn't commit...
his  sentence  --  to  relive  the crime from the victim's point-of-view
every 14 hours for the rest of his life.  It is up to Tuvok to prove his
innocence by using the Vulcan Mind-Meld before his sentence destroys his
sanity.


Emanations

While  exploring  an  uncharted  planet, the crew stumbles on the burial
ground of the alien race Vhnori.  During an investigation of the bodies,
Harry  Kim  is caught up in a subspace vacuole and is transported to the
alien  culture's  homeworld.   His  presence  there causes many to doubt
their  traditional  belief  in the afterlife, and Kim soon realizes that
the  only way he can return home is the same way he came...  through the
Vhnori's  death  stations.   Kim  places  his life in the hands of fate,
trusting  that  the  crew of the Voyager will be able to revive him upon
his return.


Prime Factors

The  crew  of Voyager encounters alien beings known as the Sikarians - a
race  renowned  for their incredible hospitality.  When it becomes known
that  the  Sikarians have the technology to "fold" space and travel more
than  40,000  light  years in an instant, the Voyager crew think they've
found  their  way home.  But the hospitality of the Sikarians is not all
it  seems  on  the surface, and both races' code of ethics is put to the
test.


State of Flux

While  on a routine exploration of a new planet, Voyager responds to the
distress  call  of  a  Kazon warship.  Upon investigation, they find the
Kazon  ship hobbled by an accident caused by Federation technology...  a
clear signal that Voyager may be carrying a traitor.


Heroes and Demons

The  ship's  holographic  Doctor  must  overcome his computer-programmed
limitations  when the ship's Holodeck is taken over by an alien lifeform
that  transforms  living  crew  members  into  pure energy.  As the only
Voyager  crew  member  able  to  face  this alien being, the Doctor must
explore  the  limits of his programmed behavior and reach beyond them to
save the crew from a fate worse than death.


Cathexis

Both  Tuvok  and  Chakotay  return  from a routine expedition injured --
Tuvok  with  minor  ailments and Chakotay greviously injured.  During an
encounter  with  a  black nebula, Chakotay's neural energy was depleted;
unless it is returned, Chakotay will be doomed to a life as a brain-dead
host.   While  trying  to  return  to  the  nebula,  the crew of Voyager
discovers  that  an  alien  presence is aboard and able to control their
efforts.


Faces

B'Elanna  Torres  and  Lt.  Tom Paris are abducted by the alien race who
suffer  from  the  Phage.   During  an experiment, B'Elanna is literally
split  into  two  separate  beings -- one fully Klingon, the other fully
human -- by Sulan, a Vidiian Soldality scientist in search of a cure for
the deadly disease.  Her two selves must learn to work together in order
to escape the alien laboratory and rescue Lt.  Paris.


Jetrel

Neelix  is  confronted  by  Haakonian  scientist  Ma'bor Jetrel, the man
responsible  for creating the Metreon Cascade, a device that was used to
annihilate  a  major portion of the Talaxian race, including Neelix' own
family.   Jetrel is allowed to board Voyager when he asserts that Neelix
will soon fall ill from long-term effects of the Metreon Cascade device.
Tempers flare between the two, with Neelix instantly distrusting the man
who  murdered his loved ones.  Ultimately, Neelix must discover Jetrel's
true motive for being on board Voyager before it is too late.


Learning Curves

When several former Maquis crew members break Federation rules, it is up
to  Tuvok  to  train  them in the finer points of Starfleet protocol and
discipline  in  order  to  reestablish  harmony  among  Voyager's  crew.
Simultaneously, a strange virus invades the ship's bio-neural circuitry,
endangering  the lives of all aboard.  As B'Elanna Torres and the Doctor
try  to  discover a cure, Tuvok and his unlikely "cadets" become trapped
in  an  unstable  part  of  the  ship.   As one of them lies near death,
Starfleet tenets are put to the test.

]-------------------------|  VOYAGER SEASON 2 |-------------------------[


The 37's

After  atmospheric  disturbances  force  the  crew  to land the Starship
Voyager  on  a  mysterious planet, Captain Janeway leads an away team in
search  of  the  source of the centuries-old distress signal detected by
the  ship's  sensors.   They discover the source of the SOS to be an old
Earth  aircraft.   Upon  further investigation, the team finds a massive
chamber  containing eight earthlings in cryogenic units, one of which is
Amelia  Earhart  (Sharon Lawrence).  After releasing them from suspended
animation,  the  U.S.S.  Voyager crew comes under attack when a group of
the  planet's  inhabitants mistakes them for members of the Briori -- an
alien  race  which  abducted more than 300 people from Earth in 1937 and
brought  them  this  planet as slaves.  It's learned that over time, the
slaves  revolted  and  killed  the  aliens.   The eight surviving "37's"
became  part of the planet's history and the cryogenic chamber was their
shrine.   Since then, the descendants of the original 300 cultivated the
planet  and  created  a  home  much  like Earth.  The crew of the U.S.S.
Voyager is invited to stay, and Janeway must face her greatest challenge
as  she  allows  each  crewmember the personal choice to stay behind and
begin a life among these kindred Humans.


Initiations

When First Officer Chakotay borrows a Shuttlecraft to perform the Pakra,
a   solitary   Indian   ritual  commemorating  his  father's  death,  he
inadvertently drifts into Kazon-Ogla territory and becomes the target of
a  Kazon  youth  attempting to earn his Ogla warrior name by killing the
Federation enemy.


Projections

The  Doctor  receives  information  that  Voyager has suffered a massive
Kazon  attack  and  that  most  of  the  crew  has abandoned ship, so he
ventures  from  Sickbay, via remote holo-projection system, to aid those
still on board.


Elogium

Aggresive  space-dwelling  lifeforms  attach themselves to the Starship,
creating   an  electrophoretic  field.   The  occurence  increases  Kes'
metabolic activity and accelerates her reproductive process, causing her
to  prematurely  enter the elogium - the time of life when Ocampa bodies
become  fertile.   However,  the  elogium occurs only once, so if Kes is
ever going to have a child, it must be immediately.


Non Sequitur

Ensign Harry Kim is confused when he awakens to find himself on Earth --
in  24th  century  San  Francisco  --  working as a design specialist at
Starfleet  Engineering  and  engaged  to be married to Libby.  Accessing
Starfleet  service  records,  he  mysteriously  finds  that he was never
assigned to the U.S.S.  Voyager.


Twisted

A  spatial distortion phenomenon occurs not only in space but inside the
ship  as  well,  changing  Voyager's  structural  layout  and completely
disabling  it.   As  Voyager  is  compressed and twisted by this unknown
anomaly, the crew must work frantically to stop it.


Parturition

When  Kes  spends free time with a smitten Tom Paris, Neelix is overcome
with  jealousy and instigates a messy fight with the Lieutenant.  In the
aftermath, the Captain sends the sparring pair on a shuttlecraft mission
to  an  M-Class  planet,  to  replenish food supplies.  When their craft
experiences an interference pattern, they crash on the planet's surface.


Persistence of Vision

As  they  ready  for  a first encounter with the Bothan alien species, a
strange  psionic  field  causes the U.S.S.  Voyager crew to succumb to a
delusional  state and their most deeply buried thoughts surface.  During
this  ordeal, the characters in Janeway's holonovel program become real,
and  her  beloved  Mark  appears;  Paris  faces off with his disparaging
father, the Admiral; Kim is finally reunited with his girlfriend, Libby;
Tuvok  talks  to  his  Vulcan  wife,  T'Pel;  and  Torres  is seduced by
Chakotay.  The ship is effectively disabled and it's up to an unaffected
Kes and The Doctor to block the mysterious field.


Tattoo

While  Chakotay  leads  an  Away  Team to drill for minerals on a moon's
surface, they accidentally disturb a village and encounter its defensive
inhabitants  --  a group with Indian origins.  A regretful Chakotay then
experiences   flashbacks   of  himself  as  a  defiant  15-year-old  who
disappoints his father by not embracing the traditions of his tribe.


Cold Fire

The crew is hailed by Ocampa colonists on an alien space station who, at
long  last,  lead them to the female mate of The Caretaker, a mysterious
being  who  may have the ability to send them home.  As Tuvok tutors Kes
in honing her rapidly maturing mental abilities, it's concluded that her
burgeoning powers have been extremely underestimated.


Maneuvers

Kazon  intruders  board  the  U.S.S.   Voyager  and  steal a Transporter
control  module.   That  collateral  enables  their  leader,  Culluh, to
persuade  rival  sects  to join together to conquer the Federation ship.
Surprisingly,  the  mastermind  behind  the Kazon's scheme is an advisor
with Cardassian, Maquis, and Starfleet tactical experience -- none other
than Seska, the despised traitor and former intimate of Chakotay.


Resistance

In  search  of  precious  tellerium  needed  to power the ship, Janeway,
Tuvok,  Torres and Neelix transport to an Alsaurian city occupied by the
hostile Mokra.  Tipped off to the U.S.S.  Voyager crew's presence, Mokra
soldiers  capture  Tuvok  and  Torres.  During the commotion, Janeway is
secreted  away by Caylem, a local eccentric who believes she is his long
lost daughter.


Prototype

When  the  crew  finds  a  deactivated humanoid robot with an unfamiliar
power  source  floating in space, Chief Engineer B'Elanna Torres is able
to repair this mysterious mechanical "man." When it comes to "life," the
sentient  artificial  lifeform,  Automated  Unit 3947, explains that its
kind  is  near  extinction  and asks Torres to build a prototype for the
construction  of  more  units.   In accordance with the Prime Directive,
Torres  must  decline  the  request,  but when 3947's Pralor homeship is
located,  the  robot abducts her and threatens to destroy Voyager unless
she constructs the prototype.


Alliances

After  Voyager  is  severely  attacked  by  Kazon and one of its crewmen
killed,  Chakotay  appeals  to  Janeway  to start thinking more like the
Maquis.   Janeway  knows  she  must strengthen Voyager's position in the
quadrant  and,  although  it's  a  difficult decision and is against her
beliefs  and  training,  she  agrees  to  take  steps toward a strategic
alliance  with  leaders  of  several  Kazon  factions.   When  they come
together  for a conference, it's eminently clear that there are no rules
in this region of space.


Threshold

Lieutenant  Paris  makes  history by becoming the first person to make a
transwarp flight.  But, soon after his shuttle returns from Warp Ten, he
undergoes  startling  biochemistry changes.  His cell membranes begin to
degrade and, despite the Doctor's best efforts, Paris dies.  Hours after
the  pronouncement  of  death,  Paris  is discovered breathing, his body
going   through   accelerated   mutations   which  leave  him  radically
transformed  into  a  bizarre  and  terrifying cross between a human and
amphibian.
