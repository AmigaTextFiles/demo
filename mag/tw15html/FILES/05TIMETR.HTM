Numerous  films  have  appeared from hollywood and other various studios
about  time  travel from The Time Machine,Time After Time to Back To The
Future  all playing on the notion as to what would happen if time travel
was indeed possible.

Well  i  think  that  it  isn`t for one main reason:  If time travel was
possible  it  would  spell the end of the human race and the world as we
know it.

Why?   Well  let`s think about this o.k?  Say the people who discover if
it   was  possible  were  scientists,they  are  always  watched  by  the
goverments  and  therefore  the  technology  would  be in the goverments
hands,to  go  back in time and kill all the russians,or americans,or the
british (who-ever gets it) to have world domination.

Understand?

O.k i hear what you`re saying "what if the technology is kept under lock
and key?"

Well  what if the guard of the time machine,used it and went back to the
time  of discovering time travel was possible and claimed the credit for
himself..he then would be the ruler of the world.

Sure  there  are positive aspects like going back to past disaster areas
and evacuating people so thousands of people would survive.

But think of this extremly worrying thought...

Say  some  nutter  gets  hold of the technology and goes back in time to
when moses took the 10 commandments,and then killed him.

There wouldn`t be any rules and subsequently in the present time,anarchy
would be running rampant.

There  will  never be a time machine or a way to time travel because god
would  have  predicted  if someone would have killed moses and therefore
his  people  would  have  been under threat from a power nearly equal to
his,if you were the most powerfull person in the world,would you leave a
blueprint of how you could become the same?  Of course not!

What`s that i hear you cry?  "what would i do if i had a time machine?"

Well i would prevent disasters by winning all the lottery money and then
pursuading  people  to evaquate or reconsider what they were going to do
with large amounts of money.

And  for  myself?   Well i`d stop myself from gaining so much weight (or
would  that  make  me  a  miserable  person?) do many other personal and
family  things  and  i  would  also  go  to london back in 1994/5 to the
nickelodeon studios and meet in person (hopefully*) Melissa Joan Hart.

Yes Kei/IceMan i mentioned her YET AGAIN!!!

*  I  would  pay  the  security  guard  lots of cash or i would persuade
Melissa with my charm and love appeal.

What`s  that  Melissa?  You`re reading this on the internet or somewhere
else and want to get in touch???

Then contact me at the following address!

That`s  all  folks,go  and  read  another one of my articles,what`s that
you`ve read them all?  Then why not buy my exercise video out now £10.99
it`s  called  "how  to gain 100 pounds with Dave Diamond in less than 10
minutes!"

Running time of the video is 2 minutes.

O.k Kei/IceMan i`m leaving now!


Bye!

[Time  travel  is  a  widely  discussed topic.  I recall discussing it a
while  back in Grapevine.  My viewpoint was that time was not a physical
thing  you  could  alter  but  a measurement we invented.  For instance,
everyone  thinks  it's  the  year  2000  shortly when in fact it is not.
About  a  year ago I did some reasearch into dates and time measurement.
Not  counting  the  fact that we do not exactly have the exact date that
this  planet  was  created  or  man first started living on it, over the
centuries  there  have existed many methods of telling the time/date.  A
day is measured in revolutions of the planet around the sun (ie one) and
there  are some who say it has gotten shorter over the centuries.  Also,
BC  (Before Christ) there were many civilizations with their own ways of
telling the date and only one was chosen, then inverted to work out when
an  exact  date  was BC.  Days were dropped/added from a week/month/year
untill  we  have  the  average  year  we  have now based on astronomical
factors  with  error  compensators  such  as  leap years (whether 2000AD
should  be  a  leap  year is still being discussed by astronomers to yet
again compensate for a possible error).
 So  with  all this it is probable that we are not telling time right at
present  so  how  could  you begin to work out a particlular time in the
past?  That said, time travel is still a fun part of science fiction but
because of the likes of the above, it's hard to prove if possible.

 On  another  point, why do you keep referring to Iceman?  Iceman is one
of  our  coders  and  ray-tracers and the one who you will must probably
encounter  on  IRC.   He is currently not an editor of The Word.  Do you
mean Amida?
