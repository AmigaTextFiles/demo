  Since last month's issue it's been pretty hectic for the Carnage crew.
Each  member  has  had his own problems in either the form of university
exams  or  in  deciding what he is going to do at the end of his current
course/placement.
 Luckily  with  the use of our internal group magazine and our e-mailing
list  we've  managed to just about stay in touch with each other to keep
everyone  updated  and  to  keep  work  on  The Word going.  So before I
continue with this text, I'd just like to thank the guys in Carnage (and
Dick  and  Andy!)  for the help and support they gave towards this issue
and future issues!

 Over  the  last  few  issues we've managed to release The Word monthly.
This  wasn't  easy  and  a lot of last minute updates occured before the
issue  you had before you looked the way it did.  With members in exams,
hard  at  work and basically unable to help out at certain times, we had
to  struggle  on  any way we could to get this issue complete.  Luckily,
due  to  an  e-mailing  list  accident  whereby  Dick (ex-Freak/NFA) got
included  in  the CRN mailing list alias (he never joined ya see) he got
an  insiders  viewpoint  of  what  CRN  were  up  to and so lent a hand.
Because  of  Dick we now have The Word on-line which spawned Kenco's web
page(s)  and  then  mine  which hosts the now official Carnage web pages
with links to the rest.
 So  now  you  can  download a copy of The Word on-line!  This hopefully
will  take  some  of  the  workload from the diskback service.  Also, we
recently  heard  from  several of our overseas contacts and from some of
our  UK  contacts  with  overseas  contacts,  that  The Word is becoming
popular  outside  the UK and that they are pledging their support.  Some
suggested  that  we  put  a  charts  section  in  the magazine but every
magazine  does  this  already  so we figured we'd do something different
such  as  an  alternative  charts  section which would be both funny and
interesting at the same time so if you have any ideas, let us know!
 Also  after  requesting  news  from any group members, we got more than
usual  this issue so instead of seperate files on the menu we compiled a
"Scene  News" article which is composed of all the groups news data that
was  sent in this issue.  And if I get it finished in time, there may be
a  "World  News"  article featuring computing news from around the world
that might be of interest to the average Word reader.

 When  Amida  recently  paid a visit and we started work on changing the
Word  interface,  I  decided  that altering the menu bar background each
issue was restrictive.  I did not like the big icons and figured I'd try
for  something  different  this issue.  Variety is the spice of life and
you  don't  know  if it will take until you try it so I did.  However if
you  don't like any particular changes we make each issue, you can write
in and tell us!
 I  usually  do  graphics  of people or a particular object when I pixel
paint  and  a  collage  of  objects representing words seemed a bit of a
challenge.   You can see what I came up with by looking at the bottom of
your  screen.   I'd appreciate any feedback.  Did you find the icons any
harder to find/use?  It's very colourfull but I'm not exactly 100% happy
with  it myself.  However if you want a go at creating your own menu bar
then contact Amida and ask for the templates!

 The Word's cfg file specifies how the main menu bar will look and where
the  clipart headers will be displayed and in what colour.  Feeling that
the  current ones in use were getting dated I decided to change a few of
them  but encountered restrictions implemented in the code.  Namely that
they  could  only  be  a  certain  dimension.   That they had to be in 2
colours  and  that the Adverts header was smaller than the rest for some
reason.   Amida  has promised to take a closer look for next issue so we
can  have  multiple  colour  clipart  of any size and we can use the cfg
codes to place clipart within an article.  I look forward to seeing this
happen.   However,  if  you take a look on disk 2 in the Bonus directory
there  should be a template and header information files so you can have
a go at creating your own section headers which we may include in future
issues.

 So  the  Word is now being read outside the UK and is being spread even
more  via  traders,  boards, the diskback service and now the world wide
web  (and  email).   This  means that we are gaining more readers!  Only
yesterday,  a  week  after The Word went on-line, I checked the Word web
site  and  the  counter  (a  new  feature just added) reported 315 hits!
Let's  say that only 50% of those hits were people downloading The Word.
That's  about  157 new readers!  That's not counting the increase in the
use  of  the  diskback  service  by  people outside of the UK as well as
abroad  and  those  that  receive a copy through Carnage traders and the
people we trade with who distribute The Word for us.
 The Word web site and Carnage web sites have recently been added to the
Amiga  web  directory,  Yahoo  and  AltaVista  search engines to make it
easier  for anyone, anywhere to access a copy.  It's even listed on some
sites  as an official Amiga magazine!  This can only help to promote the
Amiga scene (especially the UK) which is what we originally aimed for!
 From  your  point  of  view, this means that any articles you write and
submit  to The Word will be read by a much wider audience!  You can have
your  say  and  it may be read by someone on the otherside of the planet
who  just  happened to download a copy onto his trusty A1200!  So what's
your  excuse  to not contributing now?  Ever wanted to be a jounalist or
article  writer  for  a  widely  distributed  magazine?  Well now's your
chance..


 I  said above that The Word is being distributed monthly.  Between this
issue  (15)  and the next (16) though it will go back to about 6-8 weeks
because  during this period I will be moving to Ipswich and I'll only be
taking  my PC laptop for the first month untill I get myself sorted with
a  place  to live, house insurance etc..  Then I will be coming back for
the rest of my gear including my trusty Amiga!
 I  will  continue working on ideas to improve The Word during this time
period  though  and  I  will  stay  in contact with those of you who can
access PC 720 disks or whose phone number I have already.  Amida will be
running   Carnage   for   a  while  and  you  can  re-direct  your  Word
contributions  to  his address (see diskback service) but anything to my
old  address  (41  Lambourne)  will be redirected to my new address.  If
there is too much mail to re-direct then I will pick up what's left when
I  return  home  to collect the rest of my gear around 15th August.  Not
long  after  this (in August) The Word 16 should be released and will be
available  on-line.  Those of you who sent disks to the diskback service
will be informed of the new address and will get Word 16 on release.

 Other  Carnage  productions  and  joint-group productions may be put on
hold  while  members  get  sorted.  Our main coders are still working on
projects  but they may be delayed for a few weeks.  Hopefully Amida will
have  all  the details by the time you read this so contact him with any
questions you may have.

 PD companies who were interested in the e-mailing list I was setting up
in order to distribute The Word upon release to you may be interested to
know that it will still go ahead once I get my new email account set up.
At  present  any previously published email addresses for me in The Word
are  now  dead.   You can still obtain a copy in the usuall ways and The
Word  is  still  freely  distributable as long as you read the note that
applies to you in this issue.

<font color =#644C4C>
 When  I ask a lot of you to write something for The Word, you generally
say  "Well,  what  about?".   Usually I'd say "Write about anything that
interests you.  What are your hobbies for instance?".  I still get asked
this  so  often  that I thought that for this issue, I would give you an
idea  of what you could write about in the hope that it would trigger an
article idea in your head.

<font color =#4C4C4C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Bonus directory</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#644C4C> On  disk  2  is a bonus directory.  This was started by NFA and we just
carried  it  on.   If  you have any ideas on what sort of software files
should  appear  here let us know.  At present I'm working on a small CLI
program coded in C which converts Word articles back to standard text by
stripping  out  all the special codes.  It probably won't be finished by
this  issue so watch out for it in a future issue!  It will be ideal for
converting  Word  articles  to text files for html scripts or to read on
your PC.


<font color =#4C4C4C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Feedback</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#644C4C> As  always,  any  ideas  or  suggestions  you may have for adding to or
improving  The  Word  are  most welcome!  I know we haven't included the
print source yet because me and Amida are rarely in the same place so we
cannot  access  a printer to test the code.  However the clipart code is
nearly  complete  so  send  any  2  colour clipart in with your articles
specifying  the  colour  you  want them in (or hex value) and we'll take
care of it for you.
