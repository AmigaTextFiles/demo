Meld

When  a  crew member is murdered, Tuvok's investigation leads to another
crewman, Ensign Suder, who finally admits he is the perpetrator.  Vulcan
instincts   prohibit   Tuvok  from  determining  a  logical  motive  for
committing  such  a  crime,  so  he  attempts  to understand the violent
impulses of a criminal by performing a mind-meld on Suder -- with deadly
results.


Dreadnought

The  U.S.S.   Voyager  crew  spots  a  Cardassian  designed, self-guided
missile carrying a warhead capable of significant destructive force.  As
it  travels  towards Rakosan, a heavily populated planet, Torres reports
that  she  is  partly  responsible for its virtually unstoppable status.
When  she  was  a  Maquis,  she  intercepted the missile and changed its
program  to  assult its own makers, but it later went astray and now she
is  the  only hope in stopping it.  So Torres volunteers to transport to
the  missile's  interior  and  reprogram  it again.  But, before she can
detonate the warhead, the onboard computer tries to destroy her.


Death Wish

A  rebel  Q (Gerrit Graham) escapes imprisonment from inside a comet and
demands  asylum  aboard  the  U.S.S.   Voyager.   Just  as  quickly, the
well-known  Q  (John  de Lancie), arrives to force the escaped Q back to
the  Continuum.   Noting  the  dictates  of  Starfleet protocol, Captain
Janeway holds a hearing to consider the request for asylum.  A courtroom
drama ensues when Q (de Lancie) calls himself to the witness stand along
with a varied group of people, including Commander William T.  Riker, to
defend the Q Continuum against the ever-logical Tuvok.


Lifesigns

The  U.S.S.   Voyager  detects  a distress call from a weakened lifeform
aboard a small spacecraft and quickly beams a deathly ill Viidian female
to  Sickbay.   The Doctor starts treating her for advanced stages of the
Phage  by  transferring  her  decaying  body  into stasis and creating a
temporary,  healthy  holographic  program  of  her being.  As he becomes
acquainted with the alien, a hematologist named Danara Pel, the Doctor's
adaptive programming allows him to experience romantic feelings.


Investigations

Neelix,  a  suddenly  self-proclaimed  journalist,  hears a rumor that a
fellow   crew  member  has  expressed  displeasure  with  Starfleet  and
requested  leave.  Soon, Tom Paris is relieved of duty to become a pilot
with  a  Talaxian  convoy  --  leaving  a  saddened Voyager crew behind.
Almost  immediately,  the Kazon-Nistim and the scheming Seska attack the
Talaxian   fleet,   kidnap   Paris  and  attempt  to  coerce  classified
information from him.  Meanwhile, Neelix suspects someone aboard Voyager
has  been  secretly communicating with the Kazon and his sleuthing leads
him directly to Paris.


Deadlock

When  the  U.S.S.   Voyager  enters plasma cloud, while being pursued by
Vidiian  vessels, a series of astounding consequences occur.  Before the
ship is able to clear the cloud, the engines stall, anti-matter supplies
begin  to  drain, and Proton bursts causing significant casualties and a
hull  breach.   Without  warning,  Ensign  Kim  and Kes disappear into a
mysterious  void  in  space  and  Captain  Janeway discovers a duplicate
U.S.S.  Voyager and crew in a parallel universe.

While  the  U.S.S.   Voyager  crew  contends  with  the most significant
disaster  to  befall  on  the  vessel,  Captain Janeway discovers that a
divergence  field  has  caused  all  sensor readings to double and every
particle  on  the  ship  to  duplicate  but  there  is  still not enough
anti-matter  to  sustain both vessels.  When the Vidiians begin to close
in, the two Janeways meet to determine a solution, knowing that only one
of the two ships can survive.


Innocence

Tuvok and Bennet's shuttle crash lands on a sacred haven for the Drayan,
an  alien  race  which  has  shunned outside contact for decades.  While
Bennet  lies  dying  from his injuries, three frightened Drayan children
venture  out from hiding.  The young ones tell Tuvok that they have been
abandoned  by  their  people  to  die on the planet, and beg his help in
saving  them  from the imminent arrival of the "morrok" -- the messenger
of death.


The Thaw

The  U.S.S.   Voyager activates an automated message from members of the
Kohl   settlement   who,   years   earlier,  survived  an  environmental
catastrophe  by submitting themselves into artificial hibernation.  When
the  crew  transports  the  Kohl's  hibernation pods on board, they find
humanoids  in deep stasis with suppressed metabolic activity -- but with
active minds and complex sensory systems controlled by a computer -- and
that is where the nightmare begins.


Symbiogenesis

A  bizarre  occurrence  causes  Neelix  and Tuvok, who are attempting to
transport  back  to  the U.S.S.  Voyager from an away mission, to arrive
aboard  ship  as  one.   The crew is astonished when a strange but oddly
familiar alien humanoid with dark speckled skin and pointy ears -- which
is  neither Tuvok nor Neelix -- appears.  The Doctor's bio-scanner shows
that Neelix and Tuvok's patterns have merged, causing the pair to become
one  entity  -- Tuvix -- a humor-filled, logic defying fusion of the two
crewmen.


Resolutions

When  Janeway  and Chakotay contract a deadly virus from an insect bite,
the Doctor cannot find a cure.  Unable to perform her duties, Janeway is
forced  to turn over permanent command of the ship to Tuvok and retreat,
with  Chakotay, to a small planet which shields the effects of the fatal
disease.


Basics, Part I

In  an emergency message to Chakotay, Seska discloses that their newborn
son  has  been  banished  by Culluh to a servant colony.  Chakotay feels
conflicted  about  rescuing  the  baby  because  he was manipulated into
fatherhood  by  Seska.   When  the crew detects a distress signal from a
Kazon  shuttle,  they  transport aboard the critically injured Teirna, a
former  aide  to  Seska,  who  delivers  the news that Culluh has killed
Seska.   So,  with  Teirna  restricted  to  secured quarters, the U.S.S.
Voyager  heads on a rescue mission through Kazon-Nistrim territory where
Kazon raiders viciously attack the ship.  Before long, the fierce battle
is  over and the Voyager crew has lost -- outwitted by their most bitter
foe.   Surrounded and defenseless, Captain Janeway must give up the ship
to the Kazon.
