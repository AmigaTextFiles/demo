Title : Filofax
Rating: 9/10

 Another  of  my  favourite  films.   The  soundtrack is "Taking Care Of
Business"  which  is also the title it was released under in the states.
Didn't make sense over here though so released under the name "Filofax".
 James  Belushi  plays  a convict who escapes from prison to see a world
series  game.  He discovers a filofax at an airport phone point and uses
it  to  find  the  owners  home  in order to get a finders fee.  However
through  some  bizarre  events  they  keep  missing  each  other  and he
inadvertantly takes over the identy of the other guy.
 Very  funny  comedy that explores how a working class guy would live if
he  was suddenly given the identity of a businessman with a large house,
fast  car and access to a lot of cute women!  I liked the scene with the
walk-in  wardrobe  and  the  watch stand where he goes "eeny meeny miney
mo.." in order to choose a 5000 dollar watch to wear to lunch.

Title : Fresh
Rating: 5/10

 Not  your  typical  gangsta  movie  this.  A young kid wants out of his
violent  neighbourhood  where  all his friends are dying at a young age.
Brought  up on chess by his dad every day, Fresh uses his skills to play
his  2  enemies  off each other so they start getting paranoid and start
killing each other.  Amazingly done with enough style to get you rooting
for  the  kid  until the point where he hangs and shoots his dog.  Get's
really violent but the kid get's what he wants.

This is one kid you shouldn't piss off!

Title : The Fugitive
Rating: 7/10

 Another chase movie.  Imagine you were sent down for a crime you didn't
commit  and you got a chance of freedom to prove yourself but you had to
use  everything  you  knew to stay one step ahead of the law in order to
complete  your  mission.   This is basically the fugitive.  Based on the
60's  TV  series  of the same name, it's a very intriguing movie that is
worth watching.

Title : Groundhog Day
Rating: 8/10

 You  are  stuck in the same day with the same things happening over and
over again other than those you alter yourself.  Whatever you do doesn't
matter because by tomorrow only you will know they happened so have some
fun  and  throw  your morals out of the window, screw all the women that
are  in the town etc..  Bill Murray gets sick of it though and gets into
a  process  of  getting up and then commiting suicide untill he realizes
that  he  has to do good to get out of this infinitive loop.  Very funny
comedy!   Favourite  scene is where he steals the groundhog and takes it
for a driving lesson!

Title : Hackers
Rating: 8/10

 Depending on who you ask (hacker/non-hacker) you will get mixed reviews
on this film.  It gets reviewed to death on the hacker mailing lists I'm
on  (as  did Sneakers).  Don't take everything in this film seriously if
you are a hacker wannabe but it is good for what it is and I'd recommend
you to watch it.

Title : Happy Gilmore
Rating: 8/10

 Happy  Gilmore  is  a  crap  ice hockey player but that's all he's ever
wanted to be.  Apart from a great hook shot and ability to batter anyone
who slightly pisses him off, he's not good at much else.
 He  lives  with  his grandma and the house is reposesed.  He has to get
the  money asap when he actually gets into golf and realises that he can
make money at it.
 This  is another slapstick comedy that has the ability to make you piss
yourself laughing!

Title : Heathers
Rating: 6/10

 A  classic  film  starring Christian Slater as a psycho kid who changes
schools  so  often  he  doesn't have time to make friends.  He falls for
Vironica  who has 3 friends call Heather.  This is one twisted plot that
basically  involves  Slater using Veronica to kill the heathers and then
the whole school by making them look like suicides.

Best  scene  is  where 2 jocks harass him in the school cafeteria and he
pulls  out  a 357 magnum and points it in their face!  Did you ever want
to do this to school bullies?

Title : I Love Trouble
Rating: 6/10

 Two  reporters compete on a story until they reluctantly join forces to
uncover  the  truth.   Action/Comedy  spread  over  several  USA states.
Haven't seen it for ages but I'd er..  recommend it!  ;)

Title : Judge Dredd
Rating: 7/10

 Crap  acting by Stallone.  Dredd never takes his helmet off and he does
in  the first few minutes!  However the sets and computer generated city
scapes  along  with  the  ABC  warrior  cyborg more than make up for it!
Diane Lane has never looked so tasty than in this movie!

I want my own ABC warrior!

Title : Judgement Night
Rating: 7/10

 Several  friends  are caught stranded in the Bronx after they hit a guy
with  their  RV  and stop to help thus ending up witnessing his excution
once  the holsten pills drinking Dennis Leary catches up with him.  Yes,
another   action/chase  movie  but  it's  pretty  good  as  the  friends
personalities  have  to  over  come  their  differences in order to join
together and come up with an escape plan.

Title : The Kid
Rating: 8/10

 Straight  after  finishing "The Hitcher" C.Thomas Howell made this film
some years ago starring the lovely Sara Trigger.
 Howell  witnessed  his  families  execution  when  a  mere  lad.  Now a
teenager  he's back for revenge as the mysterious stranger that takes no
shit.

Title : The Last Boy Scout
Rating: 7/10

 Taking  a  break  from the Die Hard movies, Bruce Willis made this film
where it feels just like another Die Hard film!
 Willis  is a PI who is hired to protect an exotic dancer.  He fails and
he  teams  up with her boyfriend to find out who killed her and why.  If
you've seen Die Hard III then you know what to expect.

Title : Mallrats
Rating: 8/10

 Two  friends  who  hang out at the mall to kill time both get dumped by
their  girlfriends and take refuge at the mall.  Designed as a sequal to
"Clerks",  Mallrats  is  a very adult comedy that will appeal to all you
guys  out  there  that head to your local stores to read comics and play
test arcade games.
 Favourite  scene  of mine is where one guy says to his mate "I think my
girlfriend  dumped  me  coz I farted and she was going down on me at the
time".

 For all those people who guessed the Word adult password, I'd recommend
watching this!  ;)

Title : The Net
Rating: 8/10

 Miss  Bullock  is a software tester/debugger that works from home.  She
gets envolved in a conspiracy whereby the conspirators want the disk she
has and erase her identity in the process.  Designed to test the theory,
"are we nothing but an identity stored on a computer?" this film shows a
possible series of events if that identity were erased.

 Miss  Bullocks  use  of  an  Apple MAC to emulate a fireplace was quite
amusing!

Title : One Wild Night
Rating: 7/10

 Sex  godesss Jeniffer Connely falls asleep in a supermarket store where
a  night  cleaner is working..  sort of.  He lives in a world of his own
in side the store and abuses the stores contents in an amusing way.  Two
criminals try to rob the store and are hindered by the couple.

 Very  funny  comedy.  The guys bunny slippers are way cool and I want a
pair!

Title : $hopping
Rating: 5/10

 Addresses  the  issue  of joy riding and runs with it from the point of
view of teenagers on a housing estate.  Don't enjoy this too much though
as  the  producers  figured they'd better introduce a moral point to all
this, hence the ending.

Title : Short Time
Rating: 7/10

 Due  to a mix up of samples at a clinic, a cop thinks he only has a few
days  to live.  He realises that he has not provided well for his family
and  unless  he  is  killed  in  the  line  of  duty, they won't be left
anything.   So  he sets out to get himself killed by taking on the worst
and  most  dangerous  cases.  However, being a comedy, he comes out as a
living hero with loads of medals.

Title : The Specialist
Rating: 9/10

 I  liked  this film because of the use of phones and computers.  I even
went  as  far  as  to  trace the palmtop he uses (Sharp Wizard) and it's
equivalent in the UK.
 Stallone plays an ex-CIA explosives specialist who is hired to take out
a  mafia  crime  family  because  they  killed the parents of his client
(Sharon  Stone).   Using  the  latest computer technology and anti-phone
tracing techniques he avoids detection by the families apointed security
expert and ex-partner of Stallone's (James Woods).

You  have  to  be into technology and perfection with very low morals to
enjoy this film.

Title : Strange Days
Rating: 6/10

 Based  on  the eve of the year 2000 a new craze which involves sampling
peoples  memories  direct  from  their  cerebral cortex onto disc is the
current  fad.   The  main character is a dealer in this illegal activity
providing you with pleasurable memories or horific (snuff memories where
the original person being recorded dies).
 He  starts receiving clips from a serial killer as he kills his victims
and  he  has  to  work  out  who  is  sending  them  before he kills his
girlfriend.
 The  film  although  based a few years from now in the states uses some
cyberpunk styles to get it's point across such as a female bodyguard for
hire (Molly?).

Title : Tommy Boy
Rating: 7/10

 Tommy  has  to  go  on  a  road  trip  to generate sales of his fathers
products  or  the company he will inherit will go under.  Teamed up with
his  fathers assistant, the pair have a hilarious time on the road while
trying to complete their task.

This will have you pissing your pants with the simplisity of the jokes!

Title : Under Seige 2
Rating: 7/10

 I  didn't  think much of the first episode but then Erika Elinak was in
it so that must tell you something!
 The  ex-navy  seal,  now  cook is back and instead of a boat, he's on a
train  this  time.   He's  heading  to  his  brothers  funeral  with his
(extremely  cute) niece in tow when low and behold, the train gets taken
over   by   terrorists   who   use   it  as  a  mobile  base  for  their
telecommunications  equipment  which  they  use  to  take  control  of a
government  satellite  that causes mam made earthquakes in anything.  So
it's a weapon basically.
 While  watching  this  film  I was reminded of the fact that the reason
CD's  only  hold  650MBs of data is because when Philips had the task of
creating  it,  they  looked  in  their  audio collection for the longest
musical piece (Mosart I believe) which was 74mins 33secs so they created
a  formatting  procedure  which is based on this so we could of had more
space  on  a CD if they had a longer musical piece!  Bummer eh..  I tell
you,  the  trivia you can learn on a degree course and by watching films
in unbelieveable.

Title : V.I.Warshawski
Rating: 8/10

 I'm  a  fan  of  Sara  Paretsky's private eye, V.I.Warshaski and when I
heard  they  had  made a film based on the series of books I figured I'd
have to see it.  The film however is made from her first 3 books and the
facts are all messed up and out of order (in the books Boom Boom was her
cousin  not  her  lover like in the film!).  However the film wasn't bad
but even now when I read her latest releases, Kathleen Turner is not the
image  I  conjure  up  but  the woman on the book covers who looks a lot
better.  It's worth watching if you are into PI films like me anyway.

Title : Waterworld
Rating: 9/10

 Mad  Max  on  water.   I  was very impressed by this film as I had been
following  it's  progress  over  the  production  period  in the papers.
Mr.Costner even bankrolled it himself at one point when funding starting
to run out.
 If  you've seen Mad Max then imagine Max on water, replace the car with
a customised boat and you are nearly there.  Packed with loads of action
and chase scenes this is a pretty good movie.
