<font color =#4C4CFF>                            + By Amida/CrN +


<font color =#4C4C88>
  Welcome  to  another  issue of The Word, as its been an eventful month
where The World of Amiga Show have been staged at Hammersmith in London.
And  importantly  The  Word  is  100%  on-line which can now be obtained
freely  within the Internet.  This proves to be a big advantage over the
original  disk-back  service  where  by many traders who demand The Word
will  no  longer  need  to  rely  on  slow mail services.  Big thanks to
contrilbutors Dick and Andy for their efforts.  For more detailed and up
to date information please check out Dick's update file.

<font color =#4C4C88>
  The  most noticeable change which you can all see is the new real-time
clock/timer  which  is placed at the top right corner of the screen.  It
was one of the recommended improvements in Dave Diamond's article (Issue
13).  I did state that this could be done which it has.

  Its  quite  a useful feature that gives some attention and indications
to  the reader of how long you've been reading an article or running the
disk  mag and so on.  I've been testing it recently of how long it takes
to  make  my  tea, talking on telephone, pop to the shop and back etc...
Anyway it works.

<font color =#4C4CFF>
How the clock was done
======================
<font color =#4C4C88>
   The clock was first written as a separate program before merging with
the  main  Word  source.   The main bulk of the work was the integration
stage where the clock needed to synchronise with the entire program.  It
didn't  seem simply but fortunately I've already inserted a routine just
so the clock can operate independantly to the rest of the program.  Even
so  in  the  next stages I'll be looking into making sure that the clock
operates more effectively without too much program interference.

<font color =#4C4CFF>
About the clock itself
======================
<font color =#4C4C88>
  The  clock  ranges  from 00:00:00 through to 23:59:59 before reverting
back  to  its  initial  state.   In  addition - if you press &lt;R&gt; on your
keyboard  at anytime during The Word - this will reset the clock back to
00:00:00.   This  extra  function is added to the info.  file on "How to
use The Word".

<font color =#4C4CFF>
Why isn't the clock visible during the Preferences?
===================================================
<font color =#4C4C88>
  I feel it was only necessary to display the clock during the main menu
and  whilst  you're in "viewing artcle" mode.  There was no need for the
clock to show up in the prefs.  unless you really want me to I could...

Clock Accuracy
==============
<font color =#4C4C88>
  If  you  place  a  wrist  watch or a real clock against the one in The
Word,  you  will  find  that  the internal clock will tick about a split
second  faster  for  every  second  it  increments.   But  this  is very
unnoticeable.   I  will  at  some point make attempts to fine tuning the
clock.   But  so far I'm very satisfied with its current tick speed.  It
doesn't  make  a  big difference to the timescale we're currently using.
At least the World is not connected to this clock! Or may be?

  Well  theres  little  else to mention about the clock.  Otherwise just
sit back and watch it tick!



<font color =#4C4CFF><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Future Changes of The Word</CENTER></FONT></B>



<font color =#4C4C88>
  One of the next steps of improvement is to create a print function for
The  Word.   Unfortunately  I  don't have access to a printer whatsoever
which  makes  test  very unrealistic and difficult.  If printing becomes
available  I  will  or  possibly  write  a small util for back issues of
articles to be printed.  I'll decide then what needs to be done.

  Once  the print function is implemented this should allow me to create
a "search for a string" function, since both features have quite similar
behaviour.

  Theres  one other future improvement which should have been built into
The  Word.   The use of the numeric keypad to scroll textfiles.  PgUp to
scroll up a page, PgDn for vice versa.  "Home" for top of page and "End"
for  bottom  etc..  I'm one of many users who frequently use the numeric
keypad  for  numbers  and  scrolling  text.  No doubt that other readers
would  benefit from the extra functions.  Unfortunately it can't be done
right  now  coz  I'm  only  using  an  A600  (VERY  unlucky!).  Although
emulation  is  possible but I'd rather do the job properly when I return
to my A4000.

  For readers of The Word, please don't hesitate to send in comments and
recommended  improvements  of  The  Word.  We will answer every question
where possible.

Its not me who deals with the Adult Passwords &amp; Clues
=====================================================
<font color =#4C4C88>
  We  once  had  streams of email questioning why I've made the clue and
password  so hard to find + dis and dat.  Sorry but you've got the wrong
guy, I'm not even qualified for this field, besides my English is fairly
crap.   In  situations  like this I leave these password sections to the
English literature experts in the group.

  If  I could ever think of a good clue and password for an issue - I'll
be looking for a new job!

Amida.
