Recently  Kei  has had several people asking about The Word from outside
the UK.  While this is all very flattering it is also very expensive for
Carnage  because  the  overseas  readers  cannot  send  stamps  that are
acceptable with the Post Office, and sending currency to pay the postage
costs is a no no because the exchange fees are so rediculous.

Now you can download The Word from anywhere in the world because it will
be on the internet.  The URL is:

            http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/4466

Point your browser here on the day of release (hopefully a Saturday from
now  on)  and you should find the latest version, plus a counter telling
you  how  many  people  have  visited  that  page so far (including your
appearance today).

There  is  a  slight  problem,  however,  and that is that the Geocities
server  will not allow the .dms file extension.  For this reason the DMS
files are stored in ZIP format, it doesn't do much to the file- size but
it  does mean that you'll need a ZIP extractor utility as well as a copy
of DMS.

Sadly  no other archive formats are accepted on the page, if I up-loaded
a  DMS  file, or even a file with no extension, it would only be deleted
when  it  got  there.   Neither can I upload a file with no extension at
all, I've tried it, believe me!

The  HTML version of The Word will also be available from this site from
issue  16, again it will be in ZIP format but in this instance you won't
have  to  unpack it twice, it's the Amiga-only version that suffers this
little indignity.

Please  use the site, the higher that counter goes (it will be reset for
every  issue)  the more work we'll feel inclined to keep it, if it never
tops one hundred then chances are we'll scrap it altogether!
