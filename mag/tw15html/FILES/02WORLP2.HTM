Mitnick gets 22 months

Computer Hacker Mitnick to Get 22-Month Term Courts:
In   addition  to  sentence  for  cellular  phone  fraud  and  probation
violation,  former  fugitive  faces  a  25-count  federal  indictment on
software theft.

A  federal  judge  indicated  Monday  that  she  plans to sentence famed
computer  hacker Kevin Mitnick to 22 months in prison for cellular phone
fraud  and  violating  his  probation  from  an  earlier  computer crime
conviction.

The  sentencing Monday is only a small part of Mitnick's legal problems.
Still  pending against him is a 25-count federal indictment accusing him
of  stealing millions of dollars in software during an elaborate hacking
spree  while he was a fugitive.  A trial date in that case has yet to be
set.

U.S.  District Judge Mariana R.  Pfaelzer on Monday held off on formally
sentencing  Mitnick  for  a  week  in  order  to  give her time to draft
conditions for Mitnick's probation after he serves the prison term.

Pfaelzer  said  she  plans  to  sentence  Mitnick to eight months on the
cellular  phone  fraud  charge and 14 months for violating his probation
from   a   1988   computer-hacking  conviction,  Assistant  U.S.   Atty.
Christopher Painter said.  The sentences will run consecutively.

Mitnick  faces the sentence for violating terms of his probation when he
broke  into  Pac  Bell  voice  mail  computers  in  1992 and used stolen
passwords  of  Pac  Bell  security  employees  to  listen to voice mail,
Painter   said.    At   the   time,   Mitnick  was  employed  by  Teltec
Communications, which was under investigation by Pac Bell.

Judge denies Mitnick computer access

San  Fernando  Valley  hacker Kevin Mitnick wants to log on while in the
lock  up,  but  a judge said Monday she doesn't think that's such a good
idea.

"I have real apprehension about any situation where Mr.  Mitnick is near
a  computer,"  U.S.   District  Court  Judge  Mariana  Pfaelzer told the
33-year-old and his attorney.

After  all, Mitnick was in court Monday for sentencing on digital crimes
he  committed  while leading the FBI on a manhunt through cyberspace and
the nation.

While  Pfaelzer  refused  Mitnick  access to a computer, she said she is
going  to  give him something else - 22 months behind bars for violating
his  supervised  release  from  prison  on  an  earlier computer hacking
conviction  and illegally possessing telephone access codes.  Mitnick is
expected  to be sentenced formally Monday, after the judge considers the
terms of his supervised release.

In  custody since February 1995, Mitnick now faces a 25-count indictment
charging  him with a 2-1/2-year hacking spree from June 1992 to February
1995.

Speaking Monday through his attorney in court, Mitnick said he now needs
access  to  a  computer  for  strictly  legitimate  reasons - helping to
prepare his defense for the upcoming trial.

Randolph  said  Mitnick  is  not  a  thief,  but  rather  an  electronic
eavesdropper.  The difference is that Mitnick never tries to profit, the
attorney said.

At  Monday's  sentencing,  Mitnick  got  14  months  for  violating  his
supervised  release  by  breaking  into  Pacific  Bell's  computers  and
associating  with an old buddy named Lewis De Payne, his co-defendant in
the  coming  federal  trial.   He  received  eight  more  months for the
cellular telephone fraud in North Carolina.

Feds Say They'll Go After E-mail Fraud
By David E. Kalish, The Associated Press


WASHINGTON (June 12, 1997 4:44 p.m.  EDT) -- Federal regulators Thursday
put  the junk e-mail industry on notice that they will punish businesses
that  put  false information in the unsolicited mail sent to millions of
World Wide Web users.

The  Federal Trade Commission also asked the industry to figure out ways
to  stem  the  flood  of  commercial mail that has clogged the Internet,
making it difficult for users to go online.

The  FTC  said it would ask industry groups to supply lists of junk-mail
senders  to  help  its  new  drive  to detect fraud.  Penalties for junk
mailers  who  break  the law could include court injunctions to stop the
practice, the agency said.  Repeat offenders could face fines of tens of
thousands of dollars.

"We   will  try  to  go  after  them  and  prosecute  some  fraud,"  FTC
commissioner  Christine  Varney said in an interview Thursday, the third
day  of  the  agency's  week-long  hearings to address concerns about an
array of online privacy intrusions.

Concern about junk e-mail has mounted as more and more businesses try to
make  money  off the Internet.  Sending mass volumes of e-mail is vastly
cheaper  than  traditional  mass  mailings.  A mailing list of Web users
costs  as  little as $11 per million names, an industry player testified
at the hearing.

The  low  cost  of  e-mailing  has  led to network bottlenecks that have
slowed the flow of information across the Internet.

In   addition,  users  increasingly  are  reporting  e-mail  scams  from
con-artists seeking money or credit-card numbers.

FTC  officials plan to focus on two types of scams:  businesses that use
a  bogus  name  or  Internet  address,  leaving consumers with no way of
stopping the junk mail because their messages bounce back from the false
addresses,  and  junk  mailers who lie to consumers in an effort to lure
them into investment, business opportunity or other scams.

Several  major  e-mailers  and industry groups said they would cooperate
with the FTC and would supply names of fellow mailers.

"We  have  to  play  by  the  rules," said Sanford Wallace, president of
Cyberpromotions Inc.  "We want to set an example."

For now, at least, the FTC has decided to let industry figure out how to
slow  the  flood  of  unsolicited mail instead of pushing for government
rules,  such  as  an  outright  ban  on  junk  mailings.   Regulators at
Thursday's  hearing asked industry and consumer groups to create a group
to examine the problem and report back in six months.

Junk  e-mail  costs  Web users money because many pay for each minute of
Internet  connection  time, including the time it takes them to read and
delete the offending messages.

In  addition,  companies  that provide Internet service are hit with the
cost  of  sending  the messages unscrupulous mailers relay through their
computers  to  other  recipients.   Some  junk mailers use the method to
disguise their identities.

On  another  Internet  privacy  front, the FTC is pressuring information
services  companies to let ordinary Americans see the companies' records
containing their personal information.

Lexis-Nexis and other information services assemble and sell the private
details  to  law-enforcement  agencies,  private investigators and other
professionals.   But  they  don't allow consumers to see the records and
check to see if they contain inaccuracies.

"The  message  was,  'You  have to show it to the consumer,"' said David
Medine, associate director of the FTC's division of credit practices.

Computer Group Unites To Break Computer Code
But It Took 4 Months

June 19, 1997

SAN  FRANCISCO  (AP) -- Using the Internet to harness the combined power
of    their    machines,   thousands   of   computer   users   broke   a
government-endorsed code that protects electronic money transfers.

The  group,  organized  by  programmer Rocke Verser, took four months to
read a message that had been scrambled using the code, known as the Data
Encryption Standard.  The code was finally broken Tuesday.

The  national  standard,  or DES, was considered almost unbreakable when
introduced in 1977.  It is required in most federal agencies but not the
military, and is also widely used in the private sector.

Critical  information in computers is protected by the national standard
and  other  encryption  programs that use very large numbers to scramble
information.    Only   the   correct  "key"  can  unlock  the  encrypted
information.  The longer the key, the harder it is to crack.

Given  the  fact  that it took four months to break through the standard
code,  experts say the nation's financial institutes are hardly at risk.
Most  of  them  use what it known as dynamic key exchange, which changes
the keys almost constantly during a transaction.  Taking months to crack
the code wouldn't do thieves much good.

Verser  and  his group were responding to a $10,000 challenge offered in
January  by  RSA Data Security Inc., a Redwood City, California, company
that sells encryption programs.

The  actual attack on the code was quite simple.  Verser wrote a program
that  ran through every possible combination that might unlock the coded
message -- 72 quadrillion of them in all.

Then  he put a copy of the program on his Web site and invited others to
work  on  cracking  it.   Anyone could download the program, which would
then run in the background as they went about their work.

The project began with 20 computers and ended with 14,000 working on the
problem.   All  told,  they used 10 million hours of computer time.  Had
they  started  with  14,000 computers it would have taken about 30 days,
Verser said from his Loveland, Colorado, home.

While  the  code-cracking  doesn't  have  much  practical  uses,  it's a
harbinger  of  things to come, said David Weisman, director of money and
technology   strategies  for  Cambridge,  Massachusetts-based  Forrester
Research.

"It's  not  something  to  cause a panic.  But people have known that as
computing power increases, key lengths have to increase," he said.

The incident is likely to prompt more calls for relaxing U.S.  laws that
restrict the export of longer codes.
