               BY DAVE "I JUST TOLD YOU MY NAME" DIAMOND

O.k  folks  here  are  just  some of the hundreds of valentine cards and
messages  I  recieved.   Just in case you are reading this in a issue of
the  word  where  the  release  date is into the xmas period of way past
february I`d just like to say that this articles was written on the 15th
february  1997 and was released about 2 weeks later so there,if you want
my articles first then write to me!

So onto my various messages...

Roses are read,
violets are blue,
oh mr Diamond,
I want to do you

Roses are read,
violets are blue,
do it to me again,
boo boop be doo

Roses are read,
violets are blue,
I just called,
to ask for a screw

Roses are read,
violets are blue,
oh what I wouldn`t give,
to be with you


You  are sex on legs and I want to tear off your clothes,smear your body
with hagan daz ice cream and lick it off slowly.
                              From Madonna

To Dave Diamond
"will you quit it with all these false stories???"
                  From everyone reading this twaddle.

Actually  I  only  got  2 cards this year....one from the female cast of
baywatch  wanting  to  "surf" my body and the other was from,er the male
cast  of  baywatch,unfortunatly they also wanted to do the same but with
wax.

Enjoyed it?

Then read more of my articles!


Bye for now!

[Er..   this  sounds  like every other article you've sent in lately and
I'm having trouble working out if it's a repeat or not.  There's more to
life than women you know.  I'll give you some examples later when I er..
think up some. ;)   Kei]
