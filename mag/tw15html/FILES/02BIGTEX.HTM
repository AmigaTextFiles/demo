<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>No Big Text in The Word?</CENTER></FONT></B>


<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Just use Directory Opus!</CENTER></FONT></B>




             Anyone having problems getting big fonts like

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>THIS</CENTER></FONT></B>


                                  and
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=7><B>THIS?</CENTER></FONT></B>






    Then try the following if you own a Hard Drive (preferably) and
                           Directory Opus 4:



Load Directory Opus 4

Go  to  the  Fonts  directory or wherever you keep the fonts used by The
Word (Coop and WindsorDemi)

Go  into the WindsorDemi and Coop drawers and click on the numbered file
to view each font.

Quit Directory Opus and load The Word (Don't reset your Amiga)

You'll find that the big text now appears as normal.  This also works if
you can't view any big text in TWAT.





Now that's over with, I have just one question..
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=7><B>WHY??</CENTER></FONT></B>






Why  do I need to load Directory Opus and do all the above crap before I
can  view  the  big text?  I had no problems with the issues of The Word
which  were  in  CU  Amiga's  CUCD 7, but Issues 11 and 12 have gone all
buggery..  Any ideas?

[Er..  we did reset the fonts after pissing around with that new font we
were testing didn't we Amida?  Anyone else having problems?  Kei]
