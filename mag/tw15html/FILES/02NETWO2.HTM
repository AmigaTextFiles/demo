 I'm  in the middle of my 2nd year degree exams at present and I've just
sat  my  Networks  and  Communications  exam  when  I  take a break from
revision  to edit some articles for The Word and reach D!ck's article on
Networking.

 This  article  comments  on D!ck's article (so read it first) and gives
you  some  (cheap) alternatives to linking machines that some of you may
know about and some may not.

 First  off, the LAN configuration that D!ck was talking about is a "BUS
type  Thin  Ethernet"  type  LAN setup which uses NIC (Network Interface
Cards)  slotted  into your PC which have a BNC "T-type" connector on the
back  which connects to LAN cable (50ohm) segments together.  At the end
of  each end of the network is another connector known as a "terminator"
which  is  essentially  a  resistor  designed  to  absorb  signals  thus
preventing bounce-back.  This type of LAN has a size limitation of 185m.
There  are  other  LANS  such as TREE, STAR and RING which use different
protocols.   Ehernet  LANS  use CSMA/CD (Carrier Sensing Multiple Access
with  Collision  Detection) and the Medium Access Protocol (MAC) to send
data  frames  down  the  line (boring stuff concerning encapsulation and
synchromization which I won't go into).

 D!ck  said  he  didn't  understand  the  concept of a terminator in his
article.   Basically,  the time it takes to broadcast a message from one
end  terminal to another and back again is known as the "Slot Time".  If
a  collision  has  occured  then a Jamming Signal is sent to prevent any
other  terminal from transmitting for a pre-set time before trying again
(known  as  1-persistant).  If there are no ends to a cable segment then
when a signal reaches the end of a cable, it wraps around and comes back
(bounces  back),  meanwhile another station has checked that the line is
idle and has transmitted a packet onto the cable which collides with the
bounce  back.   All the terminator really does is absorb the signal.  To
understand  it  more clearly, each terminal "broadcasts" a frame of data
onto  the  cable  and as it passes through each machine on the cable (in
both directions) they read it to see if it is addressed to them.  If not
they ignore it.  It then at some point reaches the ends of the cable and
must  be  removed  to  prevent  being  bounced  back otherwise you'd get
nothing but bounce-backs forever on the cable producing noise.

 Entire  streets  could  be networked D!ck, as long as they don't exceed
185m.   You  can  use bridges, repeators and even microwave links (and I
don't  mean  to cook dinners while playing doom!).  It get's long winded
at times though and the only reason I know so much about networks at the
moment  is because it is part of my degree and my job in Ipswich is as a
network technician and support staff.  Maybe I could write some articles
in  future  issues  about  networks  but it would be stuff like "Network
Sniffing",  "LANS,  WANS  to DNS", "Intranets" and "TCP/IP" so if any of
you readers are into that sort of thing then let me know!

 10Mbps/s  is  about  right  for CSMA/CD however the 2nd generation LANs
such as FDDI can handle ten times that!

 If  anyone  does  have any questions on networking or anything else you
can  send them in to our new Q&amp;A article that we are starting soon where
the Word staff will endeavour to answer ANY readers questions!

 Where was I?....

 LANS  are all well and dandy but what will you do if you have different
computer  types  and different peripherals that are incompatible?  After
all  The  Word readers don't all have PC's do they?  Of course there are
Amiga  networking solutions out there at present but that's not what I'm
going to suggest here.

 At  present in my room I have 3 computers connected together.  There is
my A1200, my PC tower and my PC laptop.  Connecting the PC's together is
a simple matter of using a parallel cable and Windows 95's DCC software.
But what about the Amiga?

 Since  I  gave  out  my  email address in a previous issue of The Word,
several  readers have emailed me asking "how do I connect my Amiga to my
dad's  PC  to  copy  files  across?".  I've told them how but to save me
typing it again and again I'll tell you how I do it.

 You  can use either a serial cable (not null-modem as it's too slow) or
a parallel cable to connect your Amiga to a PC.  If using a serial cable
then  I recommend Twin Express which is available from the aminet in the
comms  directory.   This  will  give  you  an  average transfer speed of
115,200bps  (7-wire  cable).   If  using a parallel cable then I suggest
PC2Amiga  which  is also available from the aminet.  I think the file is
called "PC2Am308.lha".
 Setting  up  these  programs  couldn't  be  easier.  Just unarchive the
archives  and  copy  the PC files to your PC (use floppy).  Then install
them  on  both  machines,  choosing  identical  setups.   If  using Twin
Express,  type  TWIN  COM2 on your PC and TWIN SER on the Amiga and then
type HELP COMMANDS to get going on either machine.
 If using PC2Amiga, you can run "PC2Amiga" on the PC which gives control
over  to  the  Amiga  so you can turn your PC's monitor off.  Your Amiga
should  now  have  a  drive  listing like:  DF0:  DF1:  CC0:  DH0:  DH1:
DH2:   RAM:  A:  C:  D:  E:  .  If however you type "PC2Amres" then this
runs  a  version  of the previous program which lets you continue to use
the PC with PC2Amiga acting as a resident program.

 The solution I use is I boot the tower as a server machine.  I then run
an  MS-DOS  window  from  Windows 95 where I run PC2AmRes.  I then setup
PC2Amiga   on  the  Amiga  so  it  can  detect  the  towers  drives  and
peripherals.   Going  back  to Windows 95 I either use LAPLINK or DCC to
initiate a setup with my laptop via parallel cable.  Once all 3 machines
are  running  (and  my  dad's moaning about the electricity bill), I can
transfer files till my hearts content.
 A  typical  reason  for  me  to  do this is I've downloaded about 10 HD
floppy  disks  worth of goodies from the Aminet at university as well as
some  PC  software and I wish to transfer the Amiga software to my A1200
which  does not have a HD floppy drive.  Or when writing web pages on my
PC's  I prefer to use the Amiga for image creation and to convert IFF to
GIF   or   JPG   then   I'll   transfer   the  files  to  the  PC's  for
testing/formatting purposes.

 LANS  are a good idea for PC users but for us Amiga guys with maybe one
PC,  we  need  to  use  cables.  If connecting Amiga to Amiga though you
can't go far wrong if you use PARNET and a parallel or parnet cable.
 The best ad-hoc setup I've come across was at the last internal Carnage
party where we had 2 Amiga's hooked up with Parallel cables and two more
Amiga's  connected  to  them via 7-wire serial cables so we can transfer
files  across several machines.  We used that setup to complete The Word
issue 13.
