Blimey,  not again.  Well, I rented out four games from Blockbusters not
so long ago.  So I thought a review of each would seem apt, and may even
influence  some  people  into  buying  said products.  Oh yeh, I've also
bought  a  game  as  well.   So  there'll  be  a review of that as well.
Obviously.  Tch.

Roight then, me harty's. Up for review are:

Porsche  Challenge, Micro Machines 3, Tempest X3, Mechwarrior 2 and Soul
Blade.

In no particular order...

<font color =#94707C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Porsche Challenge</CENTER></FONT></B>



<font color =#884C4C>
Let's  start with Porsche Challenge.  Seeing as how I've written Porsche
Challenge  in big letters.  Well, the intro is short and sparse, showing
the characters you're going to meet during the game.  The game has quite
a few options (BTW I don't have any of the rented games any more, so I'm
going  on  memory  here).   The  options  let you save race times, extra
tracks  gained and the config (screen, music).  You can pick a number of
drivers  and, quite surprisingly, they do handle differently.  While one
car  slid  round  the  corners  like  a pig on ice, another effortlessly
gripped  the  surface  of the road like it had nails through the wheels.
As  a one-player game, you're treated to having the top down so that you
can  see  the  players in all their polygonal beauty.  You can even tell
them apart, cor eh?  That's how detailed this game is.  I guarantee that
this game will wow you, because the graphics are spot on.  This game has
the  most impressive 3d in a racing game I have ever seen.  Mind you, it
should  have,  considering it was developed in-house by Sony.  The speed
is  kept  up,  which  provides a thrilling race.  The best idea, and one
that  should  be adopted by all racers, is that of a split-screen option
for  two  players.   Alas,  the  hood goes up, to keep the polygon count
lower, but the speed is kept up.

I  managed to complete the game once and got the mirror-mode, but to get
the  Test Driver, you need to complete the game again in mirror-mode and
then  when  you complete the game with the test driver you get something
else...   that's  what  I  was  told  when  I  phoned  up  PSM at Future
Publishing  anyway.   But  I'd  had  the  game for two days already so I
didn't  have enough time to complete it again, then again.  The sound is
also  something  worthy  of  mention,  the  spot  effects  are ace.  The
seagulls  as  you  coast  round the corner where the beach is below you.
The  roadworks  and  police  siren fade in and out as you pass them, the
church  bell.  Brilliant!  It helps if you're pumping your music through
a Hi-Fi and the speakers are placed either side of where you're sitting,
as this produces an ace stereo effect.

So   then,  the  graphics  and  the  sound  are  cool,  what  about  the
playability?   Spot on, ace..  although I almost threw myself out of the
window  a couple of times when the car you challenge at the beginning of
every  race  nips in on the last corner.  That can be a real bastard.  I
found  myself shouting "NNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!  AAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!!!!  FK!
FK!   FK!   FK!"  And  headbutt  something.   It  really does get on yer
nerves.   But, apart from that (which is just a personal thing) the game
produces  a  real  challenge  and  lasts quite a while.  I could imagine
after  completing  the  game  for  the  last time thinking,"Phew, well..
that's  that  then." It's because you're always driving a Porsche Boxter
(unless  a  secret  car is revealed!) and driving it around and around a
track  would  start  to  get  a  mite  boring after a while.  Of course,
there's  the lap-times, but once you've set yourself unbeatable records,
that's it really, isn't it?

However,  it  is the best of its type I have ever played, so some fairly
high ratings are in order...

The next game :

<font color =#94707C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Micro Machines 3</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#884C4C>
The  same  as  Porsche  Challenge  is  the  best racing game I have ever
played, Micro Machines 3 is the best multiplayer racing game I have ever
played.   Micro Machines, but in 3d seems like a cool concept and it is.
Codemasters  have  pulled  it off and it is brilliant!  First I ought to
briefly  mention  the one-player game - don't buy this game just for you
to  play,  it  really  does it no justice, I tried the one-player and it
gets  boring  very  quickly as the computer players are umm..  too good.
Even a two-player (which is what I played at most of the time) lifts the
game as the other player is more fallible than the computer.

The  tracks are amazing.  You'll pick your favourites and there are some
really neat effects.  Bursting into flames when you drive through a pool
of  acid is pretty cool.  Also, the huge, hammer weapons are the coolest
weapons,  where  you try to hit the other player with your mallet.  Ace.
There  are  other weapons as well, including a missile that disables the
other  player  for a short while, another that, when you press your horn
it kind of sends out a shock-wave bouncing the other player away.  Cool.

As  said,  the  tracks are astounding and interactive, bump into the cat
and  it'll  meow like it's just been castrated.  The cups make a "chink"
sound  when you bump into them.  This game has been put together so well
its  incredible.  Oh yeah and the title screen where you pick which type
of  game  you  want to play - pure brilliance!  I didn't realise either,
but  you  can  actually  play  four players using two joypads!  Wish I'd
known!  Ah well, I had fun enough playing two-player anyway.

Even  the  background  ambience  is cool, the dinner-table courses being
complemented  by  the sounds of a banquet going on in the background and
the  school  tracks  having kids laughing and playing in the background.
The track with the Rock Project is cool, read the name tags given to the
rocks, especially the last one!

This   game  is  brilliant!   Polished,  ever-lasting,  graphically  and
sonically it's cutesy and well presented.  Highly recommended.

Hmm... Mechwarrior 2 now

<font color =#94707C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Mechwarrior 2</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#884C4C>
Right   then,  contrary  to  all  the  magazines  raving  on  about  how
wonderfully  splendid  this game is, I'm going to go against them.  Yes,
really.  And here's why..

I  recommend  that  you  only  rent  this  game and not buy it as you'll
complete  within  your  rental time.  It is VERY EASY.  I played through
the  sixteen set of missions with one clan in a matter of hours.  Then I
got  half-way  through the other clan in about half an hour.  I thought,
"Naa..   can't  be  this  easy,  surely" But it is.  I only got half way
through  the  other clan as I only started playing the other clan on the
last  evening of rental when it had to be back.  Y'see, the game is made
rather  easy  as the weapons can be fired off in salvos, ie you can fire
one  weapon,  cycle  to the next, fire that off, then cycle to the next,
fire  off  a load, etc..  all you have to do is target something to make
sure  your  missiles hit it.  The only major problem is that you tend to
heat up quickly, but if you time it, enemies can be despatched easily.

However, this is a game that gave me such a buzz when I was enjoying it.
Your  mech has a limited amount of armour and enemies tend to target the
soft  bits, so there can be some nail-biting situations where you are on
the  last  of  your  armour (when it's flashing) and one more enemy mech
comes  peeping  round the mountain in the distance.  It's fairly easy to
destroy  it,  yes,  but  then  it's  fairly  easy  for it to destroy you
considering  you're on your last legs and the enemy hasn't been hit yet.
The feeling you get in this situation...  it really gives you a buzz.

So  then,  the  structure  of  the  game  itself.   Well,  there's three
campaigns  per  clan  - two offering four missions each and the main one
offering sixteen to plough through.  With each mission, there's a weight
limit  to  your  mech,  so  you  can only choose mechs up to that weight
limit,  which  means that you start off with the smaller mechs first and
get  access  to the larger, heavier mechs later on.  The sixteen mission
campaign  also  has  (apart  from  the missions) training missions in an
arena  where  you  prove  your worth to gain ranks.  There are some well
designed  missions,  one where you have to escort your high commander to
an  opera  house  and  the  driver  decides to drive Through the warzone
instead  of  Around  it.   Tch.   So  then you have to go round shooting
everything.  Chauffeurs, eh?

Just  thinking,  the  last  time I got a buzz from a game was Turrican 2
when you had to pilot your spaceship as it got faster and faster through
narrower and narrower gaps - the first time I did that it gave me such a
buzz, the adrenalin going..  er, anyway.

So then, the graphics.  Yep, they are perdy darn fine.  Textured n stuff
with the lasers creating a real time lighting effect as they play across
the  landscape.  The sound's pretty good as well, with the music setting
the  mood  well, the sound effects of your missiles and cannons rattling
off  rounds  of ammunition being pretty realistic (if you think 100-foot
mechs  strolling  about  the  countryside  is  a pretty normal thing, of
course).

So, it is a pretty good game, it's just a bit short-lived, tis all.

<font color =#94707C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Tempest X3</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#884C4C>
This  game, for those who have not experienced Tempest before, is pretty
wierd.   I've  known  about  it, but I've never actually played it.  The
game  actually  offers  the original version as well, but I tried it and
it's  not  a  patch  on  the updated version.  There's options for a two
player  game  as  well,  but less said about that the better methinks as
that's  REALLY  wierd.   The  music's  cool,  the graphics are top-notch
worthy, so what of the gameplay?

It's  pretty  good.  It doesn't really take that much time to figure out
what's  going  on,  if  you  hit  certain enemy fire they transform into
powerups that can be picked up to give you extra potency, from points to
an AI droid that shoots the enemies for you.  Cool.

The  aim of the game is to shoot everything.  Basically.  You are a sort
of  claw  ship  thing  that hangs between two lines on the web.  The web
stretches  into the distance, appearing smaller as it gets further away.
The enemies appear from the distant end of the web and range from things
that  come  up and shoot you to things that when shot, split into two of
these  things and shoot at you, then there's the other things that build
obstacles  that  you  have to avoid when you fly through the web (you do
this  when  you  complete  a  web).  You'd have to see it to believe it,
really.   I  am  really trying my best to describe this game, but it's a
wierd  one.   However wierd it is though, it is pretty good.  It's quite
addictive  too,  blasting  away  the..er..things.   The webs come in all
shapes  and  sizes,  from  flat ones to round ones to some really rather
wierd shapes.

But  that's  it,  apart  from a bonus level where you fly through hoops,
aiming  your ship.  That's pretty good fun mind.  But the only thing you
do  otherwise  is  shoot  things  on  a  web.  The only variation is the
different  webs.   I  don't  know because I didn't get very far into the
game,  but I suspect that is all you have to do.  I suppose it could get
boring after a while.

And last of all, a game I've actually bought -

<font color =#94707C><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Soul Blade (NTSC version)</CENTER></FONT></B>


<font color =#884C4C>
Well,  I'm  quite  lucky as I bought my Playstation second hand and it's
one  of  the  first batch so I can do the easy swap method.  This allows
access  to  import cd's.  Which is a good thing, as Soul Blade runs full
screen,  at  the  speed  it  was  intended  to  run at.  And it's bloody
impressive.   For a 3d fighting game, I have never seen so many options.
Let's  see,  you  can  practice  any  character  against  any  passive /
weaponless / weaponed / fighting character.  You can survive for as many
battles  as  you  can.   You can time your fights.  There's a two-player
mode,  a one-player mode and a story-book mode where each character goes
through  their  own story.  Once you've earned weapons in the story-book
mode,  the  Edge  Master  Mode,  you can use these in the other fighting
options.

One  criticism that has been made against this game is that it lacks the
flexibility  of  moves  that  Tekken 2 has.  Hmm...  fair enough, but it
doesn't  make  it a bad game at all.  The moves can be learnt and pulled
off  and  some  of  them  are  rather  impressive with their own special
effects.  Where Tekken 2 concentrated on combat, Soul Blade concentrates
on  the armed player, each and every combatant in SB has their own suite
of  weaponry.   Rock,  for instance (now that I earnt it in Edge-Master)
has  a  rather  hefty  looking weapon that is A Big Rock On The End Of A
Sturdy  Pole.   Boy,  does it look good.  In fact, the whole game shines
with graphical effects.

Every  arena  boasts  3d  effects,  and  some  of them are amazing.  The
graphics  are  shinier,  slicker  and  another word beginning in "s" and
ending  in  "er"  than  Tekken's  graphics.  There's a whole lot more 3d
being  chucked  about  in Blade than Tekken.  It seems fairly obvious to
compare  Blade to Tekken as they are near enough the same style of game.
The  music  and sound in Blade is also of a very high standard.  There's
three  lots of music you can have in Blade, the original arcade version,
the  remixed version or kahn's mixed version.  I prefer kahn's, but they
are  all  good.   If I could only have a new cd drive as the music keeps
skipping on some tracks..  ah well.

So  then,  an  amazing  game.   There  is one other thing, though.  When
you're fighting in the one-player arcade mode, the step-up in difficulty
from  Stage  9  to  Stage  10  (Cervantes stage) is immense.  Cervantes,
sometimes  seems  unbeatable,  while the reincarnation into Soul Edge is
sometimes  easier.  There was one time where I got up to Cervantes stage
in  a  matter  of  minutes and I was stuck for ten minutes trying to get
past  Cervantes.   Then  to  beat  Soul  Edge  in  a  matter  of seconds
afterwards..  wierd.  Ah well.

For  those  that  have  Tekken  2,  maybe  take  a  look.   You might be
pleasantly surprised.  For those that don't have Tekken 2, buy this.  It
really is quite good.
