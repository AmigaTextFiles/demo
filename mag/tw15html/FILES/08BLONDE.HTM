Just  a  quick  note  to  say  that  brunettes  win  everyday.  Its very
stereotyped,  but  good looking blondes always look dumb to me, where as
brunettes  look  intelligent,  sexy, and sofisticated.  And they're more
likely to be babes, especially if they've got green eyes.

You  see  those  "blondes"  with  brown  eyes, brown eyebrows, and brown
roots?  They're stupid they are.

I  reckon  it could be true though that you go for people who share your
own hair colour.  Seems to be the way with most people I know.

Curly/Permed hair sux.

Ginger (pronounced as it is spelt, NOT "jinjer") is scanky. Ugh.

And  blokes,  with  long hair, GET IT CUT!  You see from a distance to a
shortsighted  person  such  as  myself, you look like babes.  Imagine my
embarassment  and  dismay  when  I  get  you in focus only to find you a
greasy grungy bloke.  Yuck.

[I  disagree.   Women can look beautiful with any hair colour as long as
it's not those extreme bleached blondes!  There's a limit you can go to.
I  used  to have streaked hair which was dark brown with blonde streaks.
These days it's dark brown and goes right down my back.  I ain't getting
my  hair  cut  though  and I think the goatee lets you know that I ain't
female  but  then  I don't know the kind of girls you date...  ;) When I
said girls with any colour hair, there are a few at uni with crimson and
bright  blue hair and they look great!  Green hair is out though.  Check
out manga and anime for hair colouring!  Kei]
