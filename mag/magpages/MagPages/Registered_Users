                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Registered users are entitled to a free update of Magnetic Pages. The
latest versions of the Displayer and Editor are in this package, so you
will only need the new Organiser. If you have v1.29 of the Organiser, then
the new version only has a couple of enhancements. If you have an older
version then it's well worth getting the new Organiser. To receive an
update, just send me a letter to let me know you are still using Magnetic
Pages. I would also be very interested to see a sample of work you've done
using Magnetic Pages.
