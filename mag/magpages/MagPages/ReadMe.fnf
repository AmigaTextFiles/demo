This material was submitted to me on disk directly by the author, Mark 
Gladding, for inclusion in the library.  Thanks Mark!

Because of it's size, I've archived it with the :c/lha program on this
disk, and provided a script and associated icon to allow simple recreation
of a demo disk on a two drive Amiga.
