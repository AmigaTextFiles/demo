Ja så er den her endelig. Jeres
allesammens favorit chartmag:
"Dansktoppen". Efter 4 år i dvale er
Dansktoppen blevet genoplivet og
Dansktoppen #7 er nu en realitet.


Dansktoppen #7 skulle egentlig
allerede have været released i starten
af 1996 men som det fremgår af
nedenstående oprindelige #7 leder
af Decoy/Scoopex gik det ikke helt
sådan...




»BIG:Welcome to the last issue of
DanskToppen - issue no. 7!»SML:

So what went wrong? A little story
perhaps?

Spring time 1996. Issue Sex of
DanskToppen was released with a little
delay. No big deal, as practically
every release of DT had been delayed
more or less. Anyway, issue Sex was
released announcing a new effort to
release DT more often. The plan was to
release a small issue every month with
just the chart -DanskToppen Monthly,
and a regular issue with the whole lot
every third month.

The South Sealand Party 1996 was to be
the party were Passion got together
and released the seventh issue of DT.
Even before the party we realised that
it was going to be yet another delayed
release. Also only four passionate
guys showed up. Boogeyman, who wanted
to release his demo, "Chronic",
Guybrush, The Whistle and me. Quite
disapointing, but ok, it was summer
holidays.

The party went by, a couple of months
went by, and still no sign of the next
issue. The organizing within the group
more or less fell apart with Pearl's
departure. Attempts were made to
reorganize the group, but with no
succes. Then Boogeyman decided to
leave for Scoopex and with him
followed Prophet, Prowler and Scope.
Silicon left for Rebels and I joined
Puzzle as a double member. Passion
were dying rapidly. The Whistle
decided to decrease his activities to
an absolutely minimum. With all that,
DT was again postponed. An attempt
were made to get it released at The
Party 6, but failure. Symposium96
then? Nope! But now, app. 1 1/2 years
after the planned release, it is
finally done.

So there you have it! The story about
the delay. Lack of organizing,
motivation and last but certainly not
least, lack of support! I guess the
scene developement in general killed
DT. Several diskmags and charts have
experienced the same. With more and
more people getting access to the
internet and email, the source of
support for many diskmags and charts,
the swappers, have been reduced
drastically.

Talking about the swappers as a dying
breed; What is with the Eurochart?
Removing the swapper chart is
certainly not an inspiering thing for
all the swappers that is left! Clearly
to see that the Eurochart staff thinks
they can base their chart and receive
enough support through the internet,
and maybe they can? But cutting of the
support of the still remaining
swappers feels kinda back-stabbing to
me! And the reason? To introduce an
editors chart? Hmmm... Tell me: How
many editors are there? And how many
swappers?

Maybe that is why I, as a swapper,
have written this? The only way for me
to reach the (Euro)charts, will be
through the editors charts! ;-)

Anyway, with the release of this, the
final issue of DT I would personally
like to say farewell to two of my best
scene mates. Pearl and The Whistle.
These past couple of years in Passion
have been a great time, and I wish
both of you the best of luck in
non-scene-land! I hope we can somehow
stay in touch though!

So, with no further delay I would like
to welcome you to THE most delayed
issue ever. Giving you the fewest
number of articles and the most
unupdated chart ever aswell! Just
think of this release as we do! A way
of looking back and remembering the
DK-Scene as it looked like app. one
year ago! ;-)

Hugs and beers to Ledge and Maytz of
In-Sect for the nice intro! Thanks
again guys!

Yours...

Men sådan skulle det heller ikke gå.
Dansktoppen #7 blev heller ikke gjort
færdig i denne omgang.

Næsten 4 år skulle der gå før booster,
kingsmurf, ody, puryx og psycho fik
ideen til at genoplive det famøse
Dansktoppen. Vi kontaktede
Decoy/Scoopex som var med på ideen og
som skaffede os DT6 koden med den
halvfærdige grafik til DT7.

Det viste sig desværre at The Whistles
gamle code var så fyldt med fejl at
den var stort set ubrugelig, derfor
har vi i dette nummer af Dansktoppen
valgt at bruge Quadax/Depth magkode,
den samme kode som bruges i
Eurocharten, dette forklarer også det
lidt ændrede layout.

Vi har også revideret chartsne en del
i forhold til det "gamle" Dansktoppen,
bla. er swapper charten røget ud.
Tilgengæld har vi fået repræsenteret
grafikere og musikkere bedre ved at
indføre charts'ne "best picture" og
"best module", katogorier som ikke
findes i andre chart mags.

Men hvad syntes i? Vi er interesseret
i feedback, hvilke charts kunne i
tænke jer? Skal vi genindføre
swapper charten?

Lad os høre fra jer

Mvh.
Dansktoppen slænget.
