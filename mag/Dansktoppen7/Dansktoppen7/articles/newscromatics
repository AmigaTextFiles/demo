- at tp8 an intro occured, called
"colours". and colourful it was. it
was mainly an egotrip of pharaoh &
klone, though they weren't able to do
the graphicizing without the help of
mr. gafkhan

- and we harassed the party joint with
a couple of graphics releases as well,
including the 3d 3rd place "wheels in
motion" bt dental headache (o' the pc
division)

- the mekka-symposium weren't exactly
cromatics-carpetbombed, but there was
a couple pixels and a 3d image. and
we failed participating in the
fastro-compo, so our fastro ended up
in the pc 64k. we had no time or brain
to come up with a name, so the shite
ended up answering to the name of
"no quake"

- some time after mekka-symp, a couple
got involved with the project of
reviving dansktoppen. in case you're
reading this, you'll probably know we
succeeded. 'cept of course you
consider dansktoppen a living dead...
(hysterious, yet ominous background
laughter).
anyway the cromatics sods involved in
dansktoppen are kingsmurf, ody,
gafkhan 'n booster

- one dark winter day, xitem (now
called ishmaelite.azd/vogel.superhelt.
nicolajsen) decided to quit cromatics
after a long period of inactivity.
somewhat later wiz was kicked, also
due to inactivity
