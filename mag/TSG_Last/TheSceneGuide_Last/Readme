THE SCENE GUIDE - LIFE IS A PARTY!

I am  sorry to  all who  waited so  long for  the new
issue and  who asked  many times  when it  will come.
This will be the last issue due to the fact that I am
working on other projects now.  Expect some things to
be released soon.

Anyway  if you want  to have an  overview of  all the
Amiga-parties, just take a look on the website called
"www.scene-central.com".  I will contribute  with the
results and reports from TSG to thiswebpage soon.

Please spread the complete lha-package!
