»CL5:    By Dr.Who/Gunnars Farvebio(tm)
   (DK2UK Translated by Daddy Kool)

»CL0:I clearly understand that you mean
that we also have to look at the
programming itself in a demo rather
that only be caring about who worked
out the demo and the pure visual
impression.

But still I think that there among
non-programmers are people who doesn't
quite know what to notice about the
programming and therefore judge the
entire demo from a view of what they
experience. I am among the last ones
mentioned.

When I watch a demo, I get told that
here is f.ex. a »CL1:bumpmap-tunnel» or was
it »CL1:texture» or »CL1:blur» or.... What is the
difference and which one of them is a
hard one to program and requires a lot
from the programmer? 

I don't doubt that demos with f.ex.
»CL1:"a trip to Mars"» landscapes aren't
something that you just sit down and
make shortly. Neither »CL1:vectorobjects»,
»CL1:lightsource» and »CL1:doughnuts» in several
versions. It requires that you know
something about programming, maths and
3D. I do think a bit about it when I
watch a demo - no matter if it is on
PC, Amiga or others (Spectrum?, '1453)

But at a democompetition, I want to be
sure that the demo is captivating -
but even at this point we are all
quite different - than considering how
the parts are made.(blur, texture
etc.) Last mentioned requires also a
trained eye. It's just like visiting
an art- exhibition; some people
catches by the motive, other ones by
the paintingtech- nique, some by the
composition etc.
