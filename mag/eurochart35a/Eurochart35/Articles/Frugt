»CL5:»SML:           By Qwan/Uprough!

»CL0:Many sceners don't usually talk about
other things but scene life in diskmag
interviews .. but some people do! 
This interview is all about: the
shower habits of »CL1:Coma»/»CL1:Mantra»!

»CL9:--------------------------------------

»CL5:(Q) »CL4:Ok »CL5:Coma», let's start with the
    first question. When did you take
    your first shower?
»CL1:(C)»CL0: Well.. I guess it was a couple of
    years ago...

»CL5:(Q)»CL4: Was that after you entered the
    scene? 
»CL1:(C)»CL0: Long before that! I will soon join
    a shower cooperation with many
    elite groups involved. We elite
    showerers must keep together! 

»CL5:(Q)»CL4: Whats the longest shower you ever
    have taken?
»CL1:(C)»CL0: 8 hours or something...

»CL5:(Q)»CL4: Tell me all about it!
»CL1:(C)»CL0: In the afternoon in about three
    o'clock I was walking around in my
    apartment in my bathrobe, just
    gotten out of bed. Then I thought
    "maybe I should take a shower
    ..humm..humm". I entered the
    bathroom, and turned on the water,
    and when it was nice and hot, I
    made a gracious jump in to the
    bath tub. 

»CL5:(Q)»CL4: Did you consume anything in the
    bath tub?
»CL1:(C)»CL0: Ööh .. frukt.. (men Torbjörn!),
    yes, a big bottle of coke .. and
    some bananas... to be prepared.
    Preparedness makes half the
    shower!

»CL5:(Q)»CL4: Did you notice the time was running away?
»CL1:(C)»CL0: No absolutely not, I thought I'd
    been there for just a couple of
    hours, as I usually am. 

»CL5:(Q)»CL4: But you were there for a longer
    time, how did you feel about that?
»CL1:(C)»CL0: I thought "maybe there's something
    on TV..humm..humm" and when I got
    out the time was half past eleven.
    The worst part was that I had
    missed Simpsons, but on the other
    hand, I had finished a really good
    book in the bath tub.

»CL5:(Q)»CL4: Did you smoke anything in the bath
    tub?
»CL1:(C)»CL0: Wait, let me check... no.. nothing
    apart from my sponge!

»CL5:(Q)»CL4: Have you got any kind of tip to
    wannabe elite-showerers?
»CL1:(C)»CL0: Yes, bring a lot of magazines and
    books, otherwise it would be too
    boring and you could easily start
    thinking of getting up too early.

»CL5:(Q)»CL4: Is it recommendable to sleep in
    the shower?
»CL1:(C)»CL0: Yes, absolutely. This way you can
    save the space for a bed in your
    apartment!








»CL5:(Q)»CL4: If it's anything else you would
    like to say or anyone you want to
    greet, feel free to do so.
»CL1:(C)»CL0: Of course I greet »CL1:Supernao», the
    only real elite showerer except
    for me. And I would like to
    request the editors of »CL1:Eurochart»
    to immediately include a shower
    chart.

»CL5:(Q)»CL4: Ok, I think that's all! ...shower
    on »CL5:Coma»!
»CL1:(C)»CL0: Thanks, I will.

»CL9:--------------------------------------

»CL5:And so Coma returned to his bathroom.
