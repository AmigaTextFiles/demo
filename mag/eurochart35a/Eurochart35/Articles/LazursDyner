                     »CL6:
                               some feel used...

                         standing on the edge of a void

                                    empty.. 

                              just nothingness...
                            an absence of a presence
                                  of anything.

                                   i'm cold, 
                           shuttering under starlight
                            comforting lover's words
                            reassuring of the faith 

                              - the faith we hold 
                                 in each other




















                                 i turn around
                           and walk across a desert.
                          a desert of pale blue light
                            someone wanted me there
                              in the right place 
                               at the right time

                            i accepted no rejections

                         in my mind is the only truth 
                          a fluxing, evermoving pulse
                         of living, breathing energy...
                       a butterfly on summerspread wings 

                      beneath a dark sky of ancient lores
                        it gently lifts above blue dunes
                      reaching the slowly emanating pulses
                           gradually becoming true. 






















                       but even the beautiful butterfly, 
                         swirling beneath an open sky.
                          beneath a void of emptiness.
                        and in itself avoid of feelings
                          will sometimes feel used...

                     gliding on those summerspread wings...

                              i feel a sensation 
                              quite unknown to me
                           which one i cannot say...
                            but one thing i do know:

                              that this feeling...
                               of simply -being- 
                               over azure dunes 
                                will not perish
                        as long as the butterfly glides

                            on summerspread wings...
