»CL5:           By Boris Bahnhof

»CL0:This article was first made as a DOC-
file for our »CL1:"Spontantro"» released in
July 1998.

Here it is:

In that occasion a message to all old-
school-attenders:
Please make your routines up to
date!!! There's nothing as awful as
when a programmer still does
linevectors or dots without optimizing
them to use the »CL1:68030»!! We appreciate
old ideas and find it great to use
linevector and dots, but why don't you
use the many megahertz???
You can also do new routines but in an
old designed way. We did that here by
making our usual design with
up-to-date routines.
When »CL1:GFB(tm)» began in 1991, we were
tired of the usual »CL1:Flash-and-Anarchy
style» and wanted to do something else.
We found big logos and scroll silly
and made fun of it. But now we miss
this style!!! The new style with naked
screens only showing an effect rarely
changing examples to show flexibility,
we think demos are getting even more
silly as in 1991. So now we make fun
of the new style and tribute the old
style. But please don't put us in the
same cathegory as the many new
Oldskoolers (»CL1:Spell it without "k"»!!)
since we appreciate innovation and
optimizing.

That was what there was written in the
DOC-file. Now some further words to
annoy you even more.
--------------------------------------
There are several periods of oldschool
to make. The '88-style with black
background, stars and metal
logos/fonts. Then the 1991-style with
trackmodesign (as »CL1:Enigma» by »CL1:Phenomena»)
Then in 1992/1993 the designoverdose-
mania began with too much design and
often the design took over the place
where the routines should have been.
This style is much used now as
oldschool and to people who remembers
the scene before that time, it seems
rather silly that this style should be
nostalgic.
»CL1:But what is Oldschool?» It depends on
when a person started on the scene. To
many, the 1994 style is even
oldschool, since they are newcomers,
but in all the oldest style must be
when the Amigascene began in 1987-88.

But for all these periodes, on thing
is common:
»CL1:Intensity» in programming!!!
Before the fastram-mania, a decent
Amiga demo had to be as optimized as
possible.
When people make oldschool demos now
on the big configurations, the old
intensity often seems forgotten. Why
(no names mentioned) is a new intro
made with a dot-tunnel, but no more
stars as on the A500???

Or why are everybody making linectors
with shade/blur »CL1:IN CHUNKY MODE????» In
1993 lots of programmers did the same
but in planar mode using the blitter
for shading the screen!!! Yes, it's
true!!!

Well, enough about programming.

Now Music.

Do I have to say anything about the
musicstandard nowadays??

Everybody makes techno since it is
popular now in the 90'es. But it is
also very easy to the easy way.
Demomusic now is now reduced to noisy
soundeffect with strange rhythms.
This could not have been possible for
5 years ago, because at that time,
music had to contain harmonic quality
and a real melody.
How many musicians are now able to
make a real tune??

Is it only for being nostalgic, that
some few musicians now are making
oldstyled music with melody in it, or
is it regarded as retro or kitsch???

Well, in all it should in the end be a
question of quality whether a module
is good or not. Not how modern or fast
or noisy it is, but how it contains
the quality that makes it worth to be
called music.
