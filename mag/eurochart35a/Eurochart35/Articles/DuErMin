»CL5:1. Introduction

»CL4:It will be a second party of this
kind here in our city »CL5:Szczecin». The
first one took place in 1992
organized by »CL5:SKYLIGHT» & »CL5:CRAZYBOYS»
(crap jakich malo) ... Let's take it
seriously, since '92 things have
changed, the water in Odra river has
been getting cleaner and cleaner,
many guys have died, the same amount
been born so we think it is a time to
show how a good party should look
like. 


»CL5:2. Rules»
The most important thing is that beer
and other digestive stuff will be
available at our well organized bar
so You won't be left alone in the
city of kid killers forced to feed
Your exhausted body. Anyway boozing
will be exterminated at the party
place. All kind of alcohol drinks,
drugs, knives, guns etc. will be
confiscated by our security guards.
We know that it's impossible to care
about all the 600 party people and a
small percent (very small) of
participants will get drunk. In this
case the security won't be so tough
and If You start to make mess, You or
Your body will be gently taken into a
safe place where You will be able to
get into the right mood. Now we are
serious, people who like to destroy,
who may not play with other children
could be even taken by the police so
behave yourself. 

»CL5:3. Where and when ?»

The party will took place in the
sport hall of The »CL5:ZESPOL SZKOL

»CL5:6. Party formula»

We will not try to epitomize other
parties organizers who are not able
to get a bigscreen running, trying to
lower their energy bills. The
bigscreen will be everytime in use.
We want to continue the tradition
from IO1 IO2 where  all the
information cocerning compos were
shown on the screen. Party akktio 
will endure non stop. There schould
be a time for double live techno
concert too. 

»BIG:»CL5:Party space»SML:
 
»CL5:Main room
»CL4:smaller room for participants use
other rooms for manga room, sleeping
room, izba room (its new, free
entrance). 

The Author who wants his production
to be shown during the compo also
agree to show his production on TV,
Radio etc. All the misunderstandings
will be adjudicated by the party
organizers.

»CL5:7. Prizes»

There will be prizes although we
don't know what they will look like.
Evertyhing depends on our sponsors
who promissed their support.
