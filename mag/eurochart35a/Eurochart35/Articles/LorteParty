»CL0:           [Introduction]

Christmas time; a widely recognized
holiday season dedicated to
traditions and time spent with the
family. The demo scene also has
it's traditions, and christmas time
is particular holy: Going to The
Party.

For the 8th time in a row, we're 
proud to hold our annual party in
late December and feature more
competitions, prizes, events,
surprises, and activities than
ever. Experience the real party 
feeling, meet friends, and see the
master work of soon-to-be computer
and digital arts professionals. Or
stare at your monitor for 70 hours
straight, live on Coke and peanuts,
feel the true stress of meeting
deadlines, and watch Amiga demos at
04:30 in the morning without
knowing why. In any case, you'll
have to ask yourself:

- Do You Believe in Life After
Christmas?
