»CL9:»SML:--------------------------------------



»CL0:The good ol' »CL1:Eurochart» code was as
usual handtyped by »CL1:Quedax» - suppose
not much has changed since last time,
so...

As »CL1:Visual»/»CL1:Nah-Kolor» did not find time
to send us a design, the design is the
same as in last issue, drawn by
»CL1:Nightsight»/»CL1:Depth».

The cute titlepicture is drawn by
»CL1:Zack»/»CL1:Endzeit» - thanks a lot for
helping us out in a tight spot, »CL1:Arild»!

The fabulous intro was made by
»CL1:LOONIES», featuring code by »CL1:Psycho»,
graphics by »CL1:Bifrost» and music by
»CL1:Tarmslyng» and »CL1:Apollon» - good work
guys, and you, dear reader, should
keep an eye out for the fabulous
secret part!
»CL1:Curt Cool» was the man to collect &
count most of the votes, write an
article or two, collect most of the
support, texting the gallery section,
converting the pictures and finding the
necessary information for the new
entries in the chart section.
»CL1:Cytron» did all the hard work with
formatting the articles, took care of
the homepage votes, and, most
importantly, put the whole thing
together.
»CL1:Bucko» joined as third editor, and
wrote many articles for us - nice to
have you on the team!!

The 3rd module was composed by »CL1:Michael
'One2One'» of »CL1:Anathema», and the first
and second module were composed by
»CL1:Caramel»/»CL1:Inf».

The clip-art, of which we have had
tremendous support for this issue, was
drawn by »CL1:Zack»/»CL1:Endzeit», »CL1:Wade»/ex.
scener, »CL1:Kollaps»/»CL1:Depth», »CL1:judaS»/»CL1:Endzeit»,
and »CL1:Acid»/»CL1:Nah-Kolor» - thanks a lot guys!

In case your cliparts aren't anywere
to be found in this issue, don't
worry: We are keeping it till next
issue, in case support will stop
again.
Also, as you can see, there are plenty
of articles this time, and they were
written by a wide range of scene
people - so we must pay our eternal
thanks to:
»CL1:Coma»/»CL1:Mantra»
»CL1:Darkhawk»/»CL1:IRIS»
»CL1:Gafkhan»/»CL1:Cromatics»
»CL1:ID»/»CL1:Vertical Developments»
»CL1:Kollaps»/»CL1:Depth»
»CL1:Magic»/»CL1:Nah-Kolor»
»CL1:The Lawnmover Man»/»CL1:Darkage»
»CL1:Tricktrax»/»CL1:IRIS»
»CL1:Troda»/»CL1:Pegas»

Thanks a lot guys - when we don't have
as much time as we would wish, it's
the support from guys like you that
makes our work worthwhile.

And good luck to our dear supporters
in the Eurochart 25k music competition
- we'll be back next year with a new
one!

Apart from that, thanks to everyone
who supported us with votes, 
photographs for the gallery section, 
votes, news, adverts, sweet words of
praise, and, outside the scene, love,
beer, weed, meaning of life, 
basically - luckily you are too many 
to mention.
