»CL6:             By Ash/Ward

»CL1:(This is a short version, short as in
incomplete... =)

»CL0:* »CL1:Compushere X» - »CL1:Kinder X included» *

As of now, you are all invited to
visit »CL1:Compusphere X», well nearly all
of you anyway... 

So, it's time to yet again enter the
sphere, and this time it's
Compuspheres tenth anniversary you're
going to. The party has been going on
for quite some time now, and I must
say that it has gradually improved
throughout the years. 

And to keep the tradition going,
Compusphere X will be better than
ever. Infact, it might become the
best party in a long time. With the
joint efforts of GI and Ward, and of
course, all you out there. 

For those unfortunate enough to never
have heard of Compusphere, let me
offer you some guidance: 

Compusphere is a demoparty, and it's
hard to describe what a demoparty is
really all about, since that might
change from one mind to another, but
in our point of view it doesn't mean
to have about 50% of the people just
sitting playing quake. 

That would be a gamesparty...

Sure, there might be a playstation or
something rigged to the big screen at
times, but no big network quake area
or such like. Go to Dream Hack if you
have to pay for wasting your time on
that. We are not after getting people
in just to get more money, we want to
get the feeling right too. And in my
honest opinion, gamers dont add much... 

During the years Compusphere has been
know as, although sometimes poorly
organized, a party which had a sort
of old "scene" feeling about it. This
year I and a few pals from Ward have
been helping the crew to organize the
whole thing, the result should be a
party that not only feels right, but
also flows smoothly. So if you have
any bad experiences from Compusphere,
just forget them, because you wont
get any this year. 

The party is as usual held in
Uddevalla in Sweden. It's a mid-size
party, having capacity for about
600-700 people. Like all parties, it
strives to grow larger, but this will
be the limit since the hall isn't big
enough for more people. 

And Yes, we will use the same hall as
last year, but the prices will still
be good. (see the compo section) 

* »CL1:What will happen there?» *

Well, let's say that there will
happen a lot of other things, but at
the moment the only "unusual" thing
that  is really confirmed is that
Amiga Internationals VD, Petro 
Tyschtschenko will be at the party
during 30-31 October. 

*»CL1: Compos, it will be no party without 'em »*

So what can you compete in, and what
will you win?

»CL1:Wild Compo ?»

This is a quick summary on the budget
so the prices might differ a little,
nothing big though, maybe +- 200-300... 

And if we get a full 700 people,
well, just count like this...
500+(500-100)=700 

Which in the demo contests means
9000+(9000-3000)=15000...

Wow, math can actually be fun
sometimes...

And of course, then there's hard- and
software prices on top of that.


There may also be additional compos
on request, see our homepage for more
info. 

*»CL1: What will it cost?» *

The price is set to »CL1:250 SEK», but that
will probably seem cheap in the end.. 

Girls will as usual enter free of
charge, preferably with a computer of
their own though. 

It is now possible to book a place at
Compusphere too, as usual, check our
homepage for more info. 

*»CL1: When will the party be held? »*

»CL1:Compusphere X» will be held during the
laps of »CL1:October 28» or»CL1: 29» to»CL1: November
1». 

Sadly enough this will create a
conflict between »CL1:Compusphere» and
»CL1:DreamHack», as it is held at the same
time.  This isn't good for anyone of
us really, but we can't move the 
party and neither can they. But I do
not believe that this will be a big
problem though, since there should be
enough enthusiasts in Scandinavia to
fill both parties. And competition,
after all,  will only make both teams
work harder.  

An word of advice: Dont book any
party yet unless you're really sure
about it. And if you should... Book
ours.. =) 

Hmm, by the way, atleast I'm noble
enough to mention their party. =) 

*»CL1: And where then?» *

»CL1:Compusphere» is situated in »CL1:Uddevalla»,
which is a town on the westcoast of
Sweden, about 80 kilometres north of
»CL1:Gothenburg» and 450 kilometres west
of Stockholm. It will be held in
»CL1:Agnebergs-hallen», which is the same
place as last year. Look at the
homepage, it will include a detailed
description on how to get there.
(soon anyway) 

*»CL1: The organizers» *

»CL1:The main organizers», the Galactical
Institute, attends school in
Uddevalla. All members of this crew
are students of Östrabo, a school
teaching natural sciences and
specialising in Computer and 
Information technology. 

The co-organizers, Ward, are an Amiga
based demo group spread out within
100 kilometres from Uddevalla.
