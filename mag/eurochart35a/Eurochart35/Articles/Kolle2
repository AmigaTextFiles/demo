»CL5:        By Magic of Nah-kolor

»CL0:»CL1:Note:» 2nd column for one »CL1:Eurochart»..
New World Record? :) 

»CL1:Predictions.. Forecasts...»
Didn't I say it in issue's 33 column?
You can't deny it hehe.. Infact at
the same party issue 33 got released
my »CL1:'forecast'» became a reality. It's a
good thing really, the scene can't
live without such occasions from time
to time. But this is an extreme one.
Like the time some »CL1:Anarchy» members
left the decaying group and with some
other scener's formed »CL1:Lemon». Our
planet turns around every 24 hours,
the scene circles around in time era's
of 3-4 years, only more progressed.

»CL1:Only the good die young!»
"What is he talking about" you must
think. In last issue's column I wrote,
and I quote: »CL1:'new fusions of older
sceners with eager active talents are
appreciated to form a new top group
for the coming years.'» And what
happened on the day of the release of
The Eurochart issue 33? »CL1:Artwork» died,
the organizers and some other members
founded a new group called »CL1:Endzeit»,
together with some sceners from other
groups this formation got created. How
is that for a forecast? :-)


»CL1:Ramjam vs Darkage vs Showtime vs
Magic(?)»
Not very long ago, »CL1:Ramjam» wanted
»CL1:Showtime» back as their release. But
yet »CL1:Darkage» is producing this chart
magazine since issue 5, and made some
major improvements especially on the
code. Since I was main-editor of
»CL1:Showtime» issue 4, »CL1:ACBS» asked me back
to manage the magazine again. »CL1:Darkage»
would rename there chart-mag and
continue it. In a moment of exitement
I said yes, and the whole scene was in
for a blast. I hereby officially
announce to step back as main-editor
of »CL1:Showtime» by »CL1:Ramjam», I will continue
my writings as I did the last years.
»CL1:Generation», »CL1:Seenpoint», »CL1:Retro» and »CL1:The
Official Eurochart». None the less I
would wish all involved »CL1:Ram Jam»mers
and »CL1:Darkage»d sceners the best of luck
for the future. However whatever name
the »CL1:Darkage» chartmag will get in the
future, it has the best team and code,
so »CL1:Ramjam» really is behind on them,
although they have the »CL1:Showtime» name
back again. (Have they(?) :)


»CL1:Winter Party's»
Some cold winter parties are getting
near. »CL1:The Satellite» in Poland, but
also »CL1:The Party 1998» of course. So the
scene is in for many cool releases
during summer time. And I can reveal
that my group has plans for every
mentioned party :) But I also know
that »CL1:Scoopex», »CL1:Haujobb», »CL1:Skarla», »CL1:Floppy»,
»CL1:CNCD», »CL1:TBL», »CL1:NAH», and »CL1:Mellow Chips» have
serious plans for »CL1:The Party1998».. (!)
While »CL1:Potion», »CL1:Nah-kolor», »CL1:Phase Truce»
and »CL1:Kanguroo» (»CL1:EFT») have plans for
»CL1:Satelite'98»..


»CL1:Epiloque»
Will I be back in issue 36 with a
column? Only time will tell. I guess
so, but the x-mas holiday's are near,
and I also started working, (Will
finish last year of my study's in
evenings!:) But of course I will try
my very best. Cheers to »CL1:Curt Cool» who
still is kind enough to mail me every
now and than :) (Mostly votesheets :))

»CL1:p.s.» my ONLY valid email adress is
     now »CL1:magic_mi@dds.nl» other e-mail
     addy's I had in the past won't be
     answered to..
