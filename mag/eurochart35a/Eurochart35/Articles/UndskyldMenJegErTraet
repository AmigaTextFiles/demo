1. Where and When
-----------------
Kindergarden'98 will be arranged at
Eikeli Videregående Skole (College)
in Bærum, Norway. Bærum is right
next to Oslo.

The main hall will be divided into
two, with one main hall for the
party, and a separate hall for
sleeping.

The doors open on Friday the 13th of
November.

The doors close at 14:00 on Sunday
the 15th of November.


2. Entrance Fee/Table Reservation
   ------------------------------
The entrance fee will be 150 NOK,
that's roughly about 22$. Girls get
free entrance, like they get on most
parties.

The entrance fee for foreigners will
be 100 NOK. By the term foreigner,
we do not mean people that lives in
Norway and happend to have a foreign
passport.

The prices has, as you might have
noticed, sunk with 50 NOK compared
to last year.

This year we will accept prepaid
entrance fees. The price will still
be 150 NOK.

transferred to:

Daniel Bruvoll
Værhaugstubben 19

We do not allow anyone selling food,
disks and the likes without WRITTEN
permission from the organizers.

Illegal drugs and alcohol are
ofcourse not allowed inside the
party area.

This year intoxicated persons will
be thrown out or put in the showers.
Got to have stricter rules this
year, as the hall-owners will shut
us down if they find drunk persons
in the hall. :-(

Puking inside the hall will be fined
with 100 NOK. Please use a toilet if
you suddenly have an urge.

Any damage to personal and public
property must be paid for.

We can and will not take the

Smoking is not allowed. Smoke outside.

Norwegian laws act as normal ofcourse.

Be polite and smile when the
organizers try to fix your problems.

No drunken
skateboarding/rollerblading inside

Don't bitch the organizers all the
time if you can fix something
yourself without us noticing. (But
stay away from the power/network!)

It's cool to be crew. They are gods.
