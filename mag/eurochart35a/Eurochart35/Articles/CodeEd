The past two months I've been coding
my ass out in many other languages
than Amiga-ASM. It's been impossible
for me to inspire myself to another
lecture of the coder's course. If any
of you readers have any suggestions
for the next time, I'll be glad to
hear about them.












Anyway - we're happy that »CL1:Troda»/»CL1:PEGAS»
has written a long a very interesting
article about coding, optimizing, the
meaning/purpose of coding,
systemhandling etc etc. I'm sure that
a lot of people will disagree on some
of his points. Perhaps this will start
some discussion which can never be bad
for the scene. So - enjoy Troda's
article and stay tuned!
