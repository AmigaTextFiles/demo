»CL5:        By Magic of Nah-kolor


»CL0:»CL1:Proloque»
The last few years »CL1:objects» and
»CL1:3dengines» have become common words
troughout the upper limits in
'demo-making' territory. The leading
and most dominating coders at the
moment haven't exactly coded real
breaktroughs or just some innovating
routines. (Exceptions ignored) A few
updates troughout the year of their 3d
engine is enough. 

»CL2:»CL3:Classics Of History»
Why is the »CL3:The Party 1991» winning demo
»CL3:Hardwired» still in a lot of charts
around? Because it featured mostly
amiga first routines. The same counts
for »CL3:Nexus7» by »CL3:Andromeda», the winning
»CL3:The Party 1994» demo. They were ahead
of their time, and introduced a lot of
new routines which would be seen in
other demos by other groups later on.
Even »CL3:Captured Dreams» by »CL3:The Black
Lotus» featured a ripoff from »CL3:Nexus7»,
the starfield in the beginning. Why is
it so hard nowadays to code and come
up with new routines? With more
processor power there should at least
be some room for real routine
innovation is it not?


»CL0:»CL1:When words are not enough..»
The most overrated coder in the scene
is without no doubt »CL1:Antibyte» of
»CL1:Scoopex». Notice that the entire Amiga
scene appriciates all his work the
last four or five years, but today he
is THE example of how to stay active
in an easy way: »CL1:"Updating a 3d-engine,
and letting the raytracers do all the
hard work."» Raytracers become more
important than coders nowadays.
Strange that »CL1:Showtime» (read:
»CL1:SceneTime») or »CL1:The Official Eurochart»
didn't introduce a best raytracer
chart yet. Something I described
already in an 'raytracing' article
back in »CL1:Showtime» issue 4. What's the
coder of a group nowadays without (a)
quality and powerful 3D artist(s) to
back him up? Maybe we are in the 3D
era of the Amiga Scene? :-)

»CL2:»CL3:Epiloque»
It's obvious we can't walk around the
3d hype of the late 90's. On game
consoles like »CL3:Nintendo64» or the
»CL3:Playstation» it's all 3D where ever you
look. And I must say there are really
breathtaking sequences available in
games from those consoles. Also on the
modern PC's of nowdays. But in the
Amiga Scene I really miss the thing
that made the beginning of the 90's so
special. New routines and ideas in
almost every demo.. This article is
dedicated to all coders out there,
with a special message attached: "Try
to insert some amiga first routines
next to your (updated) 3D engine in
your new demo(s).." This especially
counts to the forthcoming Amiga demo
competition at »CL3:The Party 1998».. »CL8:( '3D
not included?' :))»
