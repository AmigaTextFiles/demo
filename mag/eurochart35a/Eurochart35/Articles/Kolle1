»CL5:        By Magic of Nah-kolor


»CL0:»CL1:Note:»
After missing the last issue, I am
back in 1998 with yet another column
for the one and only »CL1:Official
Eurocharts».. As always cheers to »CL1:Curt
Cool», for regaining the e-mailing
frequency we used to have in the past
:) (Did we?? :))) This column is
dedicated to the Staff of the paper
magazine »CL1:CU Amiga», which released it's
LAST issue in September..


»CL1:Proloque»
»CL1:Internet» may as well be in it's early
stage of developement, it can't be
denied that it makes several digital
enviroments. A digital economy if you
want to define it like this. We all
gladly take these modern technologies
to our advantage, and use it so that
it benefits a faster proces in demo
making, group orginizing and alot
more, previously described in earlier
articles written by me. 


»CL1:The Amiga Scene Past Tense»
It's obvious, if not written prior; We
used to snail-mail to get the job
done, and now we e-mail. A proces in
demomaking that has gone a lot faster
and better than in the past. But not
only for this. For example »CL1:TRSI
Recordz» is exploring the internet for
commercial ends. And why not? A yearly
turnover on the Internet worldwide is
about 20 Billion dollars alone. No
wonder »CL1:Bill Gates» is the richest men
in the world, forget »CL1:Bill Clinton» and
his mistress, »CL1:Bill Gates» is the man
with the real power. Who sucks up alot
of money trough this, while Clinton
just gets a yearly salery to rule the
world :)


»CL1:Into The Great Wide Open..»
Party's sell CD's roms with demo's we
make.. Every Evening the »CL1:IRC» (read:
»CL1:#amigascne» and many other channels)
are filled with those Amiga Chat
Junkies day in day out. Or what about
surfing the web to catch the latest
updates of the homepages of Amiga
Groups. Sending another 'mass' e-mail
to - 50 sceners at the same time -
with a new module I made.. Hooking on
while being on the best party I ever
visited. And uploading the lastest
party warez to the well known FTP site
every online scener at home is eagerly
watching frequently the past 24 hours.
Being an Amiga Scener has become more
intense. It sure has compared to the
OldSkool. O boy it was real easy back
than, today it has become a 24 hours
job, to stay on top! Why else does
»CL1:Haujobb» has +/- 10 musicians in their
group??!? :))



»CL1:The Talents Stream Across The Scene»
Have you noticed, how the major groups
like »CL1:Haujobb», »CL1:Scoopex» more or less
control the mainstream of charttopping
talents? Groups like these dominated
the 'Western' Amiga Scene the last few
years, and took in about 5-6 new
members a year.. Of course »CL1:IRC» and
E-mail play a leading role in this.
People like »CL1:Owl»/»CL1:Haujobb» or
»CL1:Antibyte»/»CL1:Scoopex» make sure that a
group name becomes a label, and exists
for years now.. None the less, country
based and/or new groups are hard to be
found nowdays.. All the legacy of the
internet.. 

»CL1:Epiloque»
Ah well, easy come and easy go as some
people might say. The Amiga Scene is
developing towards it's own direction
like it's doing since aprox. 1985.
Will it ever stop? Today I read an
article in this morning newspaper
about the comeback of the »CL1:commodore
64». Released at »CL1:Cebit» in Germany, this
console will be all it takes to get
hooked on the internet at home. Using
the good old »CL1:Commodore» 64 name as a
market strategy. How smart. Who needs
a PC, Amiga or even a Mac ? Just a
good old commodore 64 to net around.
To communicate with other Amiga
sceners, and send the latest by your
group.. =)
