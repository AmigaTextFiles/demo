»CL7:             By Curt Cool

»CL0:As some of you people might remember,
we held a »CL1:Eurochart 25600 bytes module
competition» during last issue, and I
must say that the support has been
tremendous - it amounts to as much as
twelve modules, and, let's get
straight to the point, it's time for
the results:

»CL1:1.» Shampoo         »CL1:-» Apollon/Giants
»CL1:2.» Rodebutik       »CL1:-» Daddy Kool/GFB
»CL1:3.» The Datababe    »CL1:-» Reed/Damage
   Disco Vering    »CL1:-» Joule/Independent





So, the »CL1:Eurochart» team will present a
special surprise for »CL1:Apollon»/»CL1:Giants» at
»CL1:The Party 8» (as we know he will
attend - or at least he was before we
told him this... Hehehe).

For the runners up, there is THE HONOR
(!) - we're poor students who can't
even afford xmas presents for our
dearest (because we have to pay the
entrance and fare for The Party), so
that will have to wait for some other
time... When I (cc) marry some rich
girl or whatever... 

Anyway, all the modules are of course
in the »CL1:Eurochart» archives as bonus -
enjoy, there are more cool modules
than just no. 1-4!
