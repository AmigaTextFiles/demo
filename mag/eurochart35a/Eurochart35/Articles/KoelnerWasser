»CL1:o1 - Introduction»CL0:
Once upon a time, maybe three or
four years ago, every scener knew
that there's a party after visiting
the WOC, nowadays known as the
Computer '98 fair.
For the guests, this meeting was an
occasion to drink some beer, meet
scenish friends and a place to feel
comfortable. After some bad tries to
organize a party, and lastly nothing
happened last year, we, Ghandy,
Merlin-M!, Dire, Exon and eVRIMSSON
thought, that it`s time to change
the history.
We are sorry that our meeting won't
be open until the next day, but
please mail us if you're looking for
a place to sleep...  We'll try our
best! 
So, this year you'll hopefully have
a reason again to come to Cologne!
Meet us, party with us, and be happy
at the Cologne Conference 98!

»CL1:o2 location and date»CL0:
The Party is closed to Rudolfplatz, 
to one of the crowdiest places in
Cologne. It's Downtown Cologne. You
shouldn't have any problems to find
it. The address is:

Köln Veranstaltungsraum
Händelstr. 41
50674 Köln

Party phone: 0221 / 219 63 14

phone number is available only after
5:00 pm (17:00 cet) on 14th November.

Admittance is at 6 pm (18:00 cet)



»CL1:o3 how to get there»CL0:
How to get from the fair to the
party by subway/metro (Straßenbahn):

* At the fair, you have the
possibility to catch many different
trains at different metro stations.
The easiest way is to catch the line
1 to "Junkersdorf" and to get out at
"Rudolfplatz".

* If you don't find the line number
1, you either can take number 14, 9,
3, and 2, which even run from the
fair. Take one of those trains to  
"Neumarkt" and get out at the
"Neumarkt"-Station. From Neumarkt go
upstairs where the lines 1 and 2
run. Take one of those trains to  
"Junkersdorf" and get out at
"Rudolfplatz". From Rudolfplatz to
the party place, it will take you
about 4 minutes of walk. It's behind
the big "Crown Plaza Hotel". Once
you reach Rudolfplatz with line 1 or
2, you have to walk straight ahead,
the same way the line 1 and 2 use to
go.  Cross the big intersection and
then turn left the first street. Go
straight up about 30 meters and you
will see the party place on the
corner of the next intersection. 
Look out for the blue gate.  Also
look for some party signs around the
place. 





how to get to the party from the
fair by car:

Cross the bridge called "Deutzer
Brücke". That's the way to Centrum.
After crossing the bridge, just stay
on your way and go straight ahead.
After a while you'll see a big gate
and McDonalds on your right. Do the
drive across the big intersection
and turn left at the first street.
That's the place of the Crown Plaza
Hotel. 

You can use the big parking lot of
the hotel. Press the button
"KURZPARKER" and take your parking
ticket. The parking fee is 2,00 DM
per hour before 7 pm (19:00 cet) and
from 7 pm to 7 am (07:00 cet), it's
only 1,50 DM per hour. The parking
lot is opened 24 hours. We recommend
you to park your car at that hotel
parking.  It's the cheapest around
and anyway, it's quite difficult to
find a free parking place around the
Centrum, especially on saturdays.

Outside the parking lot, ask for
Händelstr. It's 50 meters away from
the Hotel. And almost everybody
should know the Händelstr.  It's
even possible to see the party place
from the main entrance of the Plaza
Hotel.

For a detailed city map, look at
www.academicus.de/cc98 or take a
look at the picture "Citymap.IFF"
included at the invitation-pack.
»CL1:o4 entrance fee»CL0:
The entrance fee is very low
comparing to previous parties took
place during the WOC. We are not
that kind of people who gonna let
others pay for our amusement. We
figured out the entrance fee and
maked it as low as possible for you,
that we just will be able to pay the
rent of the party place.

Entrance fee is 10,00 DM only.

- Admission free for girls! -
