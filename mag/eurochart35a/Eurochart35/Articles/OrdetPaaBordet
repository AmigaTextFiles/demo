            »CL5:By Bucko/Depth

»CL0:When I first joined the scene a couple
of years ago there were a couple of
memorable groups that were the focus
of the UK scene. They were »CL1:Eltech», »CL1:NFA»
and »CL1:Carnage». »CL1:NFA» as many of you will
know produced the disk magazine »CL1:"The
Word"» which due to some really
talented and funny writers quickly
became a very popular production in
the UK. All was not well, however, as
»CL1:The Word» had a weakness, it was coded
in »CL1:AMOS». »CL1:Eltech», who considered
themselves a 'proper' scene group set
about attacking »CL1:NFA» and later also
»CL1:Carnage» for trying to muscle in on the
scene with inferior productions. They
accused »CL1:NFA» of being lame and bad for
the scene. Admittedly »CL1:The Word» was not
the only reason for this. »CL1:NFA» were
condemed as being commercialised,
mainly due to them producing »CL1:the AGA
experience» CD's (although both
»CL1:Spaceballs» and »CL1:LSD» have produced
commercial CD's) and also putting a
shareware fee on a slideshow, which
admitedly was pretty lame. However the
attack was also aimed at »CL1:The Word»,
which lead to »CL1:NFA» stating at the start
of every issue of »CL1:The Word» that »CL1:"This
is not a scene magazine."» Groups in
the UK chose sides, some, like
»CL1:Grasshopper Developments» joined the
»CL1:NFA» bashing bandwagon, while others,
like »CL1:Phuture 303», sympathised with
»CL1:NFA». However, the fact remained that
people enjoyed »CL1:The Word» magazine. I
remeber »CL1:Triumph»/»CL1:GHD» writing to me and
plastering a »CL1:GHD» ASCII logo with the
words »CL1:"NFA - We don't like 'em"» on his
letter. However when the next issue of
»CL1:The Word» came out people were always
asking for it. "Most sceners don't
spread »CL1:The Word» because they think
it's lame." Strange how I was always
asked for a lame production then. The
aforementioned »CL1:Triumph» even confessed
to quite liking it and descibed it as
"a bit of a laugh." So I would like to
put this question to you. »CL2:Would you,
the scene community rather see »CL3:AMOS»
productions from smaller groups who
lack really experienced coders, or
would you rather they not bother?
»CL0:After all does a disk magazine really
need to be hard coded in assember?
It's not like it's supposed to be a
mega-demo that pushes the machine to
its limits after all. If the
presentation is there and the
production, be it a slideshow, music
disk or disk magazine, works properly
then does it matter if its coded in
assembler or BASIC? Lets have some
lively debate over this next issue
boys and girls.
