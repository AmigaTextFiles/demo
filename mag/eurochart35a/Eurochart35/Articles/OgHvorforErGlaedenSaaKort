»CL0:Hi 2 all! Before everything, respecto
to »CL1:Ramses» and their demo. I have
nothing against it or them, diz iz
just an opinion of my own, ok? 

I have seen the 3 demos which were at
»CL1:Euskal Party» on the Amiga section. All
of them were very good and nice, but
really.. in my opinion »CL1:Ramses»
shouldn't have won... The favourite
was the one from »CL1:Network», »CL1:Synthesis», a
very nice demo, wiz great effects,
cool soundtrack and very well coded.
Well, their demo hang at the middle of
the show, so the demo obviously
couldn't have a good position, as they
placed 3rd.. hopefully they placed 3rd
on the »CL1:ASM'98», and diz time they
ruled.. but that's another history...
Then we have a demo from »CL1:Capsule», »CL1:The
Last Inline», perhaps a little short,
but wow! Its effects were really
awesome, shocking and cool!

So, what's the problem wiz the »CL1:Ramses'»
demo? Hum... If you have a look at the
demo without knowing it was first on a
demo compo you only can say: Hey! Diz
iz just another demo, becoz it's that,
just another demo... It has a nice 3D
engine, but no more! I found it wiz a
big lack of design, also the music was
not in the demo thematic and in
general was boring.. Yes, the effects
were well achieved, but no more.. And
a demo which is boring is not a demo
for being the top winner in a party.

As I said the demo is not bad, is
quite good, but it doesn't give
anything new to the demos.

Perhaps they should give a better
design to their demos and to search a
better way to include music to their
releases. They have the talent and the
perfect people to rule in the scene,
but they are not giving their most..
Let's see what they will give to us in
the future, good luck »CL1:Ramses!»
