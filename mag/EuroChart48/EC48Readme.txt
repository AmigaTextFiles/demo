The Official Eurochart issue 48 was released the 29th of March, 2006.

Notes of interest:

Amiga OS4 version - due to a buggy SDL library, cpu load is at 100%, this 
is fixed in the new beta SDL, and so the next issue of the EC will not 
have this issue. Also, Upon exiting this version, you might get a 
recoverable alert. Shoddy we know, but we wanted to release the EC as 
soon as possible. This will get fixed for the next issue, naturally. 

68k AGA version - This version refuses to work when launched from any 
RTG resolution. Launch it from a native AGA resolution. It also needs 
the fonts included in the archive to be placed in 'Fonts:'. Also works 
on WinUAE. 

68k+GFX card version - Probably un-enjoyable due to extreme slowness. 
This is the ported Panorama engine. It is working, but various features 
take a heavy toll. Can probably only be viewed reasonably on high-speed 
PC's within WinUAE, and the sound will probably stutter anyway. Ixemul 
and SDL libraries needed.

Windows version: .exe packed with UPX. 

C64 version - Delayed beyond the release of the EC 48 - Look for EC49 
on the C64.
