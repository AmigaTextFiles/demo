A hyper jump back into the past.«»
«»
The Italian demo scene environment has 
always seen a limited spectrum of demo
crews.«»
«»
And only a small number  of  them  were
able to gain respect from  the  scene 
brotherhood.«»
«» 
One of the most  known  and  respected 
surely  had to be   Ram Jam. 
Build  up  in  late   1989   by  ACBS, 
who,  mainly  in  Italy,   did a lot 
of  work   to   find   new  members.«»
«»
They amazed the  Italian  scene 
with  many   productions,   but  their 
European  success   was   gained   and 
consolidated thanks to the release of
"The Charts" followed by "Showtime" .  
"The Charts" can easily be  considered 
one of  the most respected chartmag
of the Demo-Scene history.«»
«»
THE CHARTS was created by a bunch of  the
most well-known names of  the  Italian 
scene of that era namely:  Posdnous, 
M.A.S.E., Flender and Rocketeer.«»
«»
Work  on it started  in  early  1993,  when 
a lot of magazines were released
and   The Official Eurochart  was  the 
leading  chart  on  the  market.
Issue by issue The Charts  gained 
respect.«» 
«»
They managed to release about a  dozen
of issues in a period of 2 years, which
means an issue every 1.5 months. 
It was really an enormous lot of work.«»
«»
After that time passed and a couple  of  
new issues saw life. This time with a
new  editorial team with ACBS and VEGA
at  the head of it.«»
«»
Consequently,  due  to  internal 
conflicts  with the previous editorial 
crew, they  decided  to  make  a  new 
'zine called  "Showtime".«»
«»
Four issues of Showtime have  seen the
light under the Ram Jam flag. But later 
Ram Jam was undergoing a really 
black crisis period. The leading people of
Ram Jam decided to freeze or close all
activities.   Kaosmaster/RamJam ( me )
left  and obtained permission to  take 
Showtime into Darkage. 
And thus  Showtime   once   again  had 
an opportunity in the scene world.«»
«»
Posdnous,  M.A.S.E., 
Flender and  Rocketeer  formed  a  new 
crew  to    develop    games,   called 
"The Spooky Fellows" (TSF).«»
«»
Vega   (Giuseppe Galluzzo)  took  over 
the leadership  of  the  crew  for  a 
couple of years. Later leadership  was 
passed  to     Surfing    who  officially
moved the crew to the PC.«»
«»
From  then on Ram Jam  spent a 
decade with sporadic minor  releases on
the dark side of the scene.«»
«»
