Aspects of the New Scene and Mags«»

The Amiga PowerPC scene of these days
is really quite elite,  more so because
of the number  of  sceners 
rather than the quality ;).«»
«»
We  can   consider  each other  real 
PIONEERS. For this reason the idea to
release EC with a new PPC  engine  is 
really a great move.«»
«»
We should focus one thought in our minds:
The scene is  made  by  a  couple  of 
people, we have touched the ground and 
we cannot go further down :). Now it is  up 
to us to start building it up again, and we
can do it from the very foundations.«»
«»
We can see ourselves as  Tristar 
and Red Sector back in 1985/1988. 
When they  were  a  small  bunch  of 
sceners  and  started  their  career, 
with all  the related  problems  of  that
period  in  time.«»
«»
Yes,  a  diskmag  is one of the means 
that  can help to strengthen up the new
PPC scene.  Obviously it is not the  only
element! But it is the tool that MUST
invigorate spirits.«»
«»
At this point, we should consider 2 
things:«»
«»
1) Joining forces is vital.«»
2) Having a break with the past is also a
factor to keep under consideration.«»
«»
Regarding the first point, I think it is 
obvious.«» 
«»
Joining forces will give  us 
an increased production rate  and  a
better quality. «»
«»
It  is   like  a  puzzle,  with  few 
pieces, the  scene  must  join  them 
together. Much more cooperation please.«»
«»
Also in our case it is  better  to  not 
disperse votes,  articles,  editors, 
ideas, etc.. etc..«»
«»
About the second point, I fully agree 
with Darkhawk. A break with  the past 
is  a necessary consequence. «»
«»
Something  I  have  preannounced  in 
SHOWTIME    by     introducing   the 
'legends' chart.«»
«»
It is important to give space to new 
people. People who now WORK hard,
who support the PPC scene  or are otherwise 
active on 68k. «»
«»
So let's make a magazine for  active 
people, giving  them the opportunity 
to  be ranked   on   a  chart and 
writing  about  them,  if  they 
deserve it.«»
«»
Once again, I stress to you, that it is 
important to  motivate  people,  and 
that is our job, dear editors.«»
«»
Just a name mentioned in a mag or an 
article about that scener will give
him great motivation.«»
«»
It is useless to always write about the
same old 'non-existing' people. 
Sceners get bored.«»
«»
And  remember  that   "The  pen   is 
mightier   than  the  sword",  think 
twice before writing war articles.
Articles must  be  constructive  not 
destructive («c1»come on, Browallia wants his fun too - ED«c2»).«»
«»
And I  am  talking  due  to  personal 
experience.«»
«»
Of course, we must have a sort of break
with  the past, but we will  have and
need a bridge that   connects   these 
two worlds.«»
