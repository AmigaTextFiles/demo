RALLYING THE SCENES - WHAT HAS HAPPENED?«»
«c3»«»
By Darkhawk of IRIS«»

Now it came to pass; we finally released the Eurochart again, making it the first truly multiplatform mag, and also making it the first AOS4 mag to appear (7Days, a polish 68k/MOS mag was in the start of
November).«»
«»
Our aim with the EC was (rather ambitious to be sure) to have the Amiga scene rally behind us. Old and new scenes alike, and from there we could face the future together. We could have sceners working on both 68k and PPC productions, sharing most things and stimulating each other. We could give the new PPC scene its first mag, we could heighten interest in this scene, while also rewarding its members through our chart and focus. At the same time, we could keep the old Amiga scene alive and well, never forgetting them, nor closing them off from the 'future'. All of this we dreamed about, and now the result has finally materialized in issue 48 of the Eurochart.«»

NOW WHAT, DEAR SCENE?«»
«c2»«»
It is too early to say what will happen of course, but the EC was to be a ray of hope (sorry Majic 12) for the Amiga scenes (and an interesting ray of light for other scenes), showing it that it is still possible to do things, to have fun, be creative and productive, in those scenes. Will this happen? It is up to you of course, but in the 2 years (!) that have now passed since I finished the EC 47 and wrote more or less stirring about what we would do and what the scene might do, what exactly has
happened?«»
«»
'Not too much' is the real answer, isn't it? This is not doom & gloom, but in those two years, we've had one demo crew do a few demos for AOS4, we've had a dwindling number of MOS demos and we've had more or less the usual number of 68k demos (and quite a few of great quality I might add). While things look rather ok for the 68k scene, things haven't exactly been moving forward for its proposed spiritual
successor.«»
«»
In most other walks of life, having a 2 year hiatus means that you will miss a lot of things. In this regard the 2 year hiatus of the EC didn't really miss much. A new PPC scene has NOT emerged yet. The groups who did MOS demos have become a bit quiet, though MAWI (mainly because of Kiero) is still active doing the occasional MOS demo, mostly at Breakpoint. FIT and Bandwagon have more or less become the first cross platform demo group, porting their demos to the PPC architecture, and Universe has emerged as an AOS4 demo
group.«»
«»
This isn't much, during 2 years, is it? Some momentum is still missing, some incentive to join up with the new PPC scene has still not be established. Will it be established? Possibly, and the EC will be a bridge between these
scenes.«»

68K POSITIVITY INTERLUDE«»
«c2»«»
In this spot however, I must add that it doesn't look too bad for the 68K scene. A lot of great productions have come out, and demo groups that were active 2 years ago are still active today. Yes, things are slowly diminishing on this scene too, but not too much actually, and the level of quality we see from the best releases might even have grown a bit. This is great, and personally I do prefer the 68k scene and can't see why we should have another - were it not for the fact that I would like the Amiga scene to survive into the future. To do that, we do need to have a minimum of growth now and then, offsetting the dwindling of our numbers. This won't happen in the 68k scene anymore, but it might theoretically have happened with a new Amiga PPC scene. However, during the 2 years, it seems like the 68k sceners have mostly seen and dismissed the PPC option for now. Maybe this will change, and maybe it won't, but I would like to express my sincere respect for the groups who continue to bring out great and artful 68k releases. You indeed have done well these past two years, and it is only fitting that this be recognized
too.«»

CREATION (can't come) OUT OF NOTHING«»
«c2»«»
Back to the less positive happenings during these last 2 years however.«»
«»
The never-finished AOS4 and the beleaguered MOS haven't helped the new scene emerge either, we must admit. Amiga sceners are notoriously loyal and tenacious, clinging on to their scene, even far better than the C64 scene has managed to do, but they don't attract new sceners
either.«»
«»
New sceners come from the pool of computer users (of course). If that pool doesn't grow, and it's the same computer users who have been there for decades, then the scene is obviously not going to grow
either.«»
«»
In the PC scene they can talk about other causes for people not joining the scene - lack of interest because everything is about games now, the youthful lack of focus and concentration, and so on. This is a luxury problem for them - we can't talk about this as a problem because we don't get new users in the first
place.«»
«»
One can possibly keep a scene alive without new computer users, if that scene was there when there were a lot of users to recruit. From there, loyalty and motivation can keep you in the scene (in the best of circumstances). However, the new PPC scenes have never had a lot of users to recruit from, and the only way it is going to survive is if there is an influx of new users, of which a few can then get recruited into the scene.«»
«»
AOS4 and MOS have a responsibility there, if you will. Without them, the new scene will fail, obviously. As both are in a bad state (you might want to argue this point - fine, write an article about it) right now, things are not looking too well. Now - as also two years ago - most of the hope rests in the release and marketing of a final AOS4, while MOS continues competing with it. Will that be enough? Will it even
happen?«»
«»
The future of the Amiga PPC scene does not rest in our hands unfortunately - look to the developers and marketing people. They had a near impossible task to begin with - to bring out a complete non-IBM compatible platform and make a profit (big or small) by selling it. It should have helped that they had a brand name like the 'Amiga' (cursed at it seems to have been), and a loyal following of die hard Amiga fanatics, that were sure to buy the new machines/OS'es. It has taken an incredible amount of time so far though, there have been a lot of soap operas and the development has been left to enthusiasts, not professionals. This might be all well and good, in that these enthusiasts are sooner or later (maybe) going to come up with something that is nice/great to use, but I am very doubtful in regards to it attracting new users. We shall see, but Amiga has really been stored away, its name gutted to be used for set-top appliances (and even that is niche), while small third party developers have been allowed to risk their own time and money on producing a computer OS and hardware
platform.«»
«»
It is a weird situation, and then I haven't even looked into what has happened with MOS in those two years. MOS had/has a few things going for it, namely that it is actually released and more feature complete than AOS4 (though this has been slowed down), and it was hosted on better and cheaper hardware. It was never really 'Amiga' though, and it has become less and less so. Now, with the makers of MOS having stopped development (though other enthusiasts are updating it/drivers ever so slowly) while they fight Genesi, the company that was supposed to pay them, MOS is not looking like a stable
bet either.«»

WHITHER SCENE?«»
«c2»«»
What does all of this mean for the scene? Well, it isn't good news. In fact everything about the Amiga in a commercial perspective since 1993 (and also before that, really) has been tragic, misleading, cursed, deadlocked, etc. All small and big initiatives that have been started have led to a bit more blood being squeezed out of the patient, with no new blood entering. It is indeed amazing that the patient survives for so long, and ultimately sad that she is submitted to this degrading treatment which is becoming a mockery of the life she once enjoyed, more than a decade ago. The best to hope for now seems to be for a decent, quiet release of a working, (more or less) final AOS4. Maybe in another 2 years time? From there, a niche can be had, although new hardware will have to enter into the equation too. Realistically not many new sceners, if any, will come of this, the most positive
scenario.«»
«»
If no new users enter, the question is: Will the old 68k sceners shift to the PPC Amiga's? My guess is: no. They have had more than two years already in which they could have done so. I don't think waiting for the release of the Eurochart is what kept them from doing so either. There is not much interest in spending money for an outdated machine with a niche OS that is either not finished or not updated. We already have that, so why waste money on more of the same? A new Amiga needs to provide more than that. There needs to be life, creativity, growth - then the scene will follow for
real.«»
«»
The best thing that can realistically happen now, is that we keep together in the 68k and PPC scenes - we do work for productions that are PPC one day, and for 68k the other, we mingle and we enjoy the releases of each other. Thus, we grow into one real scene, and even though only a few might release PPC stuff, it will still be a part of us, and it will still motivate us. Maybe some of us will then one day acquire a PPC Amiga too, especially if it comes with a working and updated OS of course. That way, we can still keep our level of activity and enjoy both worlds. This is not bad at all, and in this regard, the EC will serve as a bridge to both worlds. But hoping for more than this for the Amiga, its users and its scene at present would be..
Optimistic.«»
