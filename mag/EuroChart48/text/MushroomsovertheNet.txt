Recently a new scene resource  has 
been  spotted  on  the  net,  it's the
'Magic Pack Archive',  arranged by
Majic Mushroom.  
He started to release packs in early
1990, but it wasn't until joining 
'Crack UK' and getting good code support 
for menu systems that he really started
packing big time!«»
«»
Magic  Pack  Archive,   as  stated 
'Contains the Amiga Demo Pack Disks
compiled and released by Majic Mushroom
during 1990 - 1993', where you can
find productions from many well known
crews , such as Rebels, Razor 1911, 
Andromeda,  Quartz and many others..«»
«»
EC has also discovered  an unreleased
pack  series , named 'Honey Packs'. 
Take it in consideration, as they 
contain some pretty nice stuff.«»
«»
Magic Pack Archive is still a work in 
progress, at the end it means to feature
about 112 packs! That is something
quite interesting for any scene 
collector.«»
«»
Once the site will be completed with 
all 112 packs Majic Mushroom will work
on a new site with a huge and promising 
demo collection. It will take some time 
but it will be worth waiting for it.«»
«»
In the modern demo scene packs have 
become useless, but what does Majic Mushroom
think about this?
"Packs were great for 2 reasons:  
You could get many productions on 1
disk and your productions would get
onto many peoples packs, meaning they
were seen by everyone!  
There is no need for packs these days
as everyone has the internet and hard 
drives."«»
«»
«c4»... and a solution?«»
«»«c2» 
"I think the modern solution is a web site
 with all the groups productions on.  
Boards are still a great idea but I think 
they are just there for nostalgia rather 
than what they used to be for."«»
«»
«c4»But, who is Majic Mushroom ?«»
«»«c2»
Let's hear it directly from himself.:
I started out in Christmas 1989 when I got my A500.  
I already knew about the demo and cracking
 scene so got into it right away.  
I formed a group with a couple of local friends 
called "Liquid Gold".  We were lame :)«»
«»
Then in October 1990 I went to my first party 
and met lots of new people.  
A couple of days afterwards I joined 
Pussy UK and then after a few days left and joined Crack.«»
«»
I stayed in Crack until February / March 1991 when Paradroid 
and I left to form Flash Production UK.
 This group suffered from not being able to get the 
right members and many people were bullshitting 
about us so we dropped the group.«»
«»
I joined Razor 1911 for a few weeks but the 
guy who was organising the group was getting
wrong information about who was in so I left
and joined Plague.«»
«» 
Plague lasted until just after Xmas 91 and died!
After a couple of weeks groupless I joined Quartz.«»
«»
I loved Quartz!  It was the happiest I
ever was in a group, everyone was so friendly
and I worked my way up to Co-Manager.  
I also released some intros and my first
ever demo under Quartz, which came 3rd in
a demo competition!«»
«» 
At The Party '92 some of the Anarchy guys 
were plotting to leave and in early 1993 they did.  
The group they formed was LEMON.!«»
«»
I was asked to join and head up the UK 
division which I did.«»
«» 
Lemon. died at The Party '93 :(«»
«»
My next group was Fairlight where I was 
a modem trader, but when Splatt! left to
quit the scene I decided to leave as I
did not really like the guys running the group. 
I moved over to Delirium and joined some great
guys in WildCard and Phil Douglas.«»
«»
Later on that year I moved back to mail
trading and also joined a group whom I 
had always loved.... SONIC! 
Although now they were known as SONIK CLIQUE
or something heh :)«»
«»
Those guys and their productions were 
great and I wish I had been around longer,
but sadly, at Christmas 1994 I has to quit
the scene because of work reasons and I
never went back to the Amiga scene in the same way.«»
«»
The last thing I coded for the Amiga was
"2 Blokes and An Armchair" for TESKO for
the Deja-Vu party in England in 97 or 98, 
I forget now!«»
«»
And that's my scene career!  
I enjoyed most of it, never regret any of 
it but I definitely know it was time to
quit when I did.«»
«»
And finally Majic Mushroom greets fly out for :  
Rotox, B-Real, Splatt!, Murk, Dalmak, 
Paradroid, Dan, Nuke/Spaceman, Hannibal, 
Carsten Sørensen (SurfSmurf), Gonzo and 
Freagle, Phil Douglas, WildCard... 
so many great people who I respected!«»
