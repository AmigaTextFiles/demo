In  every  issue  of the EuroChart we're going to give away a nice prize in
our  easy  competition.   Usually only a few sceners bother to take part in
any  kind  of competition, and therefore there's a BIG chance for you to be
the lucky winner.«»
«»
Therefore I recommend everybody to take part and have some FUN.  The winner
will  be  announced in the next issue of the EuroChart and get the prize by
mail.«»

Now...   What can you win this time?  That's a bit uncertain at the moment,
but  it can be everything from a CD album by some scene musicians, user CDs
with  programs  and  productions  to a T-shirt from a party held the latest
years.   Time  will  tell,  at  least everything will be clear when the
winner is revealed.«»
