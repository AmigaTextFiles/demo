THE STORY BEHIND THE DEMISE OF ELLESDEE'S GRAPEVINE«»
«c3»«»
By Various People«»
«c2»«»«as»
Editors note: This is some selected text taken from a (now) old discussion about 
the demise of the online Grapevine. As you may recall, this magazine managed to 
come out 3 times, dealing mainly with the PC and the scene in general, but 
wanting to receive more Amiga specific support. After lack of support and a lot 
of pressure on them because of their group name and their property theft of the 
Grapevine name, they closed down the mag, and it has been silent ever since. 
However, I have yet to see a report about this in a diskmag, so this is why we 
include these snippets for you. Although the things you are going to read are 
highly subjective/one-sided, it is still clear that Ellesdee took over the 
Grapevine name without permission by the authors, and that they even modeled 
their group names and individual handles after the LSD people. This is in fact 
quite interesting, and it would be cool to have an interview with those Ellesdee 
members about what on earth they were thinking in doing this, the most blatant 
property theft in the scene, but the members seem to have passed on. If they 
would like the chance to reply to the statements in this article, they are 
welcome to contact us.«»

 [THIS WAS ORIGINALLY POSTED ON THE NOW DEAD ELLESSDEE FORUMS BY PAZZA/LSD, THE 
ORIGINAL EDITOR OF GRAPEVINE. WITHIN 48 HOURS OF HIS POST, ELLESSDEE WHERE SO 
ASHAMED THEY CLOSED THE SITE DOWN SO NO-ONE COULD READ ANYTHING, THEY MANAGED 
ABUSE & BITCHING AS A REPLY, BUT COULDNT COME UP WITH EVEN ONE SENSIBLE ARGUMENT 
TO WHAT PAZZA HAD WROTE.«»

IF ONE GROUP USES ANOTHERS KEYGEN WITHOUT PERMISSION TO CREATE A SERIAL NUMBER 
FOR A NEW RELEASE THERE IS A LOT OF SHOUTING & NAME CALLING ABOUT IT, ISNT 
STEALING THE NAME GRAPEVINE AND HAVING A SOUND-ALIKE GROUP NAME AS BAD, IF NOT 
WORSE?«»
«»
I USED GOOGLES CACHE TO LOCATE THE FIRST MESSAGE FROM THE ELLESSDEE BOARD, THEN 
I RE-POSTED IT TO www.SCENE.ORG. HERE IS THE MAIN MESSAGE, WITH ANY INTERESTING 
REPLIES. I HAVE ALSO ADDED A MESSAGE FROM MAXIMAN/LSD AT THE END I FOUND IN THE 
GRAPEVINE YAHOO GROUP. «»

The #### ginger-haired stepson is dead - Now lets give the memory of Grapevine 
what it deserves.«»
«»
I was Pazza/LSD, a friend of mine posted 'This Is All A Bit Lame Isnt It?', then 
told me about it. Yes, he is an ex-LSD member and his wishes to remain anonymous 
should be respected.«»

So to begin with, how can I prove I am who I claim to be? Im told Monty Python 
is still about and as hes not so well known on the scene (sorry Alan :) ) heres 
some info scenewise probably only Monty Python would remember - MP lodged with 
me (although I dont recall any rent being paid lol) he had the front bedroom, I 
had the back bedroom, his dog was called Mima and his girlfriend at the time was 
called Lisa. He then got his own place with Lisa, and Echo/LSD lodged with them 
(ill leave the saga here...). My 'location' on Skullbuggery BBS was 'I Blow 
Goats' (a joke I decided to keep as it amused me) and we used to rag Fish/LSD as 
really being the wrestler Hulk Hogan :). I hope thats enough.«»

OK onto why im here - The original Grapevine achieved almost Legendary status in 
Amiga UK circles, but like all things it eventually died – here lets explore why 
it died? Because the world had changed, the Internet had become the WWW and disk 
magazines had became totally pointless, newsgroup access is available to all 
that want it, any clown can surf to a WWW page. So there was no longer a need 
for a diskmag from the days 2400 modems where still expensive and 14400 modem 
users where still elite.«»
«»
Then a decade later some wannabees decide to resurrect Grapevine, possibly in 
the hope some of the original GV popularity will rub off on them. WRONG - IT 
DIDNT - GO AND ACHIEVE SOMETHING WITHOUT RIDING ON THE BACKS OF OTHERS! Calling 
yourselves a name that sounds like 'LSD' and producing a disk magazine called 
Grapevine doesnt make you part of the scene. Why didnt ex-LSDers come forward? 
Why didnt ex-UK sceners come forward? Because some no-longer give a #### and 
because others feel they didnt want some nobodies trying to 'be part of us' (I 
subscribe to somewhere between the two).«»
«»
If you want to do something creative, then start your own group, which doesnt 
have the name especially created to be a corruption of another scene groups 
name. You want a magazine too? «»
«»
Then start one but dont call it Grapevine as you have no right to even hint your 
piece of #### has anything to do with the original Grapevine, because it doesnt. 
And while im at it, having members that have names like ex-LSDers it very VERY 
lame, theres a mention that your ECHO isnt the LSD Echo (now Spoonwizard) and 
surely the nick DAZZA is supposed to remind you of a Grapevine editor if you 
change one letter? Sad, Sad, Sad.«»
«»
I recall some statement on here (or in the new GV) about Sir Garbage Truck being 
in touch with Shagratt and the Shagster is happy about the use of GVs name
- A quick chat to Shagratt soon revealed hes never even heard of Sir Garbage Truck, 
SGT, or Truck, has never said he supports the new GV (cos he doesnt) and feels 
the same way about the use of the name GV as I do.«»
«»
I am in touch with some ex-LSDers and I know of quite a few ex LSDers and UK 
sceners on irc in their own server, as we used to have also. We have 
deliberately kept away from the 'new' GV, because we all believed if you all 
ignore a lamer he will go away, as will the new GV. And it has. Yippee!«»
«»
And Nerve Axis wasnt an original UK Amiga group (mentioned in some forum on here 
earlier), they came to be around the time many original UK groups where already 
dying including LSD. Although they did provide a useful vessel for Maximan to 
empty his bag into, Mat may explain ;)«»
«»
Now respect the name LSD and Grapevine, acknowledge the fact youll never be good 
enough to be part of it and go forth into the world and do your own thing, like 
we all have.«»
«»
Respect to all ORIGINAL LSDers and GVers, your names have already become part of 
Something thats a Legend, dont let some wannabee ####s drag you down.«»
«»
'Grapevine - once a legend, then hi-jacked by lamers, now it can return to the 
status it had and we can remember it fondly once again.'«»

PPPPS – This is NOT for publication in anything ran by ELLESSDEE, or included in 
anything called GRAPEVINE, as I do not wish to be associated with ####s, Ive 
only posted on this forum because of the wonderful news that the abomination 
they dare to call Grapevine is finally dead after a pathetic three (count them) 
issues. It may be included in the Grapevine Mailing list if you REALY want to 
include it, I dont read that though, ive moved on.«»

I have talked to PaZZa about his post on the Ellessdee forum (as above). We 
would all like to make it clear that the only problems PaZZa (and other ex-
LSDers) had with the "new" Grapevine was using our name - using another name for 
the magazine and we wouldnt have said a word, however it seems that the name was 
the most important factor to these wannabees, to give people the impression it 
was an official 100% ex-LSD/ex-GV sanctioned magazine, WHICH IT WASNT IN ANY 
WAY! Despite the fact Ellessdee had stated they would like some input from ex-
LSD or ex-GV people, PaZZa and Shagratt had already came out against the idea of 
restarting GV well before their first issue was released, but Ellessdee ignored 
this and went ahead, probably in belief the name GRAPEVINE and its concept where 
in the public domain - WHICH IT WASNT AND NEVER WILL BE.«»
«»
We all agree that using a LSD sound-alike name was the height of lameness. We 
made a name for ourselves through our own hard work, starting with nothing and 
creating what became almost a Legend in the UK. We did NOT hi-jack someone elses 
work and tried to continue it badly!«»
«»
PaZZa has added - himself (main editor), Shagratt (the coder), Scud (part time 
co-editor) and other ex-GRAPEVINEers and ex-LSDers are AGAINST anyone 
ressurecting Grapevine again (nomatter who you think you are and what rights you 
believe you have and what arguments you come up with). Reguards to anyone still 
interested in GV, but the WWW replaced GV over a decade ago (with sites such as 
this one), with its accessability to all and information on any subject.«»
«»
If you want a good read, surf to www.google.co.uk and search for whatever you 
are interested in, I GUARANTEE its all been done before on the internet (if no 
luck try the newsgroups or the groups ran by sites such as Yahoo etc. failing 
that the internet is full of forums) and in the unlikely event it hasnt, then 
there is YOUR reason for having your own web page or blog! Please DONT assume 
because you once read the original GV, or contributed to it, or even once where 
an co-editor you have the right to restart it - BECAUSE YOU DONT!«»
«»
Thanx to those friends who are "always lurking" and keep us informed of anything 
worth looking into.«»
«»
A Last word from PaZZa - I truly hope I never have to emerge again to defend 
Grapevines memory, or even use the name "PaZZa" - Ive moved on, no-one can bring 
back the Amiga scene from the early 90s! Im now crawling back under the stone I 
came from.«»
«»
Typed by an ex-LSD member after a further conversation with PaZZa, hes read this 
and is happy with its post.«»

[GARBAGETRUCK ASKED ABOUT ROAR IN A REPLY, HERES WHAT WAS SAID...]«»
«»
Garbagetruck - The text magazine your thinking of was called ROAR (the lion you 
are probably thinking of was an ascii Lion PaZZa used as a logo), most people on 
the scene guessed it was by PaZZa - and of course it was - but it was nothing to 
do with LSD of course. I understand PaZZa has all copies somewhere still, ill do 
my best to snarf them, but dont hold your breath.«»

PaZZa (main editor of GV & LSD manager at the time of GV) and Shagratt (main 
coder of GV, plus coder of classics like "Jesus On Es" etc.) had already stated 
BEFORE the new GV #1 was released that they where both against the idea of them 
using the GV name, but ellessdee shouted them down, deciding that the name 
GRAPEVINE and its look and feel where public domain - and they never where. They 
and other ex-LSDers just want it clear to the scene it was not sanctioned or 
supported by ex-LSD and they sincerly hope that no-one else will try to revive 
GV again, like the Amiga, its dead FULL STOP. We all hope this episode in GVs 
"life" is now over for good.«»
«»
I hear the Pendle Europa Amiga utility floppies arent produced anymore, maybe 
ellessdee could change their name to "Pindel Eroopa" and instead of being 
produced by Manny, Dazza could be Danny. Silly isnt it, but thats exactly what 
happened with GV!«»

[IN MAY 2003 MAXIMAN/LSD POSTED THIS TO THE GRAPEVINE YAHOO GROUP / GV MAILING 
LIST...]«»

The sooner this Yahoogroup is killed, the better.«»
«»
So many years down the line, I have absolutely no idea why anyone would want to 
attempt to resurrect Grapevine magazine today, especially when whatever is 
produced is most likely going to be a shadow travesty of the "glory days" of the 
magazine when it was on the Amiga. «»
«»
Anything that has been attempted so far has only appeared to soil the name and 
reputation t the magazine nurutred int he first place.«»
«»
There is no scene to speak of anymore, and the main appeal of Grapevine - it's 
diversity of articles and subjects - has been replaced by a prevalence on the 
web of specialised sites and groups for the topics (and more) that Grapevine 
used to cover.«»
«»
Aside from the nostalgic motivation to resurrect Grapevine, I have to say it's a 
pretty fruitless exercise to undertake, particularly when you have no clear way 
forward, no obvious (and captive) target audience, and no real source of 
articles - aside from the web, and that is just pure plaguarism.«»
«»
If you want to produce another magazine, then good for you. Go for it. Just 
don't slap the name "Grapevine" on it and expect it to be a success, or to be 
appreciated by those who put the effort into the original Grapevine in the first 
place.«»

[SO IS THERE **ANYONE** OUT THERE THAT WAS BEHIND THE ORIGINAL LSD GRAPVINE THAT 
SUPPORTED THE NEW GRAPEVINE? WHY DID WE ALLOW THESE LAMERS TO SPOIL A LEGEND 
WITH THEIR THIRD RATE CRAP? YOU CANT PUSH YOUR WAY INTO THE SCENE BY PRETENDING 
TO BE PART OF IT, BECAUSE ELLESSDEE ARE NOT & NEVER WILL BE.«»

TO QUOTE SOMETHING PAZZA ONCE SAID - SOME PEOPLE ARE BORN LAME, SOME BECOME LAME 
& SOME HAVE LAMENESS THRUST UPON THEM - WHERE DO THE ELLESSDEE WANNA-BES
FALL?«»
