FUN MEANS CRAP??«»

During my work of adding all the
productions from 2002 and onwards into
our online database, I had the
sometimes dubious pleasure of checking
out all the productions on my Amiga.
This elicited more shaking of the
head than feelings of awed sensation,
to say the least.«»

The reason for this is not the groups
who try their best, but are just not
able to compete with the best. The
reason is the flood of so called 'joke'
or 'fun' releases you will encounter 
if wanting to view all the Amiga
releases. While I have been pleasantly
surprised some times, most are, in my
definition, untalented crap.«»

In the Amiga scene of today, it is not
viewed as particularly nice to say
this out loud, as there is a feeling
of imminent collapse if anyone would
criticize the current quality of
releases. Sceners seem to think that
anything is ok, as long as it is a
release, because otherwise the Amiga
scene might be dead. This is in
some ways true, and the hope seems to
be that those making fun productions
will one day make quality releases
instead, but this is a quite vain
hope, and in any case, there should be
limits to what crap one should put up
with, that degrades the scene as a
whole and makes ex. Amiga sceners with
fond memories shake their heads when
viewing those newer releases.«»

My position here, as well as the
opposite is an old one. Is the scene
for fun, or is it for competition?
This question has always divided
sceners, though the truth is clearly 
something in between. Should not so
skilled people be allowed to release
crap on top of crap with no hope of
them ever wanting to better themselves
just because it is 'fun'? This is a
somewhat misconceived stance on fun
vs. competition I think. In the past,
when the scene was big enough, you
would naturally get people looking to
continuously better themselves, who
released stuff that was not too good,
but as long as you knew that they had
a desire to become better and more
competitive, it was totally ok, after
all it takes time, skill and
dedication to become a gifted scener.
Nowadays however, things have
degenerated, with people releasing
crap, people who have no intention of 
ever bettering themselves, but who do 
it all for the 'fun' of it, sometimes
releasing truly spectacularly crappy
stuff just to do it. I think the thing
that really annoys me in this, is the
fact that they don't really view the
scene as a place to better themselves.
I don't think they get as much
'fun' out of the scene as they could
have, if they engaged themselves more
in it. Also, they de-motivate other
sceners who might still be serious.
What's the point in continuing to work
hard during long hours on a new,
creative effect, when the majority of
those who will watch it themselves
release 1 day demos with big breasted
ladies, old and recycled 2d effects
and uninspiring music? And that's on a
good day, mind you... On bad days,
they release polish language joke
scanned slideshows coded in AMOS
(arghh).«»

Honestly, there are a handful of
really skilled and creative groups
left, more or less the same as
we've had for the last 5 years, and
there are also other groups who do try
to better themselves, and who show a
certain spirit, but as the amount of
good releases decrease, as people
think it is not worth the effort to do
too much work, the amount of so called
'fun' productions increases. That
name, 'fun' production, is usually
only a name used to defend the
production from criticism, something
to make excuses at it being crappy. it
was and to some extent is still the 
same with so called 'old school' 
releases, sadly. Everyone knew that if
an unskilled group called their
production oldskool, it would be an
excuse for the crappy quality. Now, it
is the same with joke productions,
mostly there is no effort or beauty
put into it, the term is simply an
excuse to release uninspired crap.
Sad, but true, no matter how
unpleasant this is to admit.«»

Some of you might argue that you like
making fun productions, meaning
productions that raise smiles or
laughs with people. This is fine,
there is certainly a place for this.
However, there is nothing 'fun' in
most fun productions, nothing talented
nor inspired, no hard work. In real
fun productions as in real old school
productions, there is hard and skilled
work, whether the aim is to make
people laugh or emulate the old school
spirit with talented work. This is
great, but sadly these terms have been
more misused and used as shields for
crap, than they have been used for
real fun or old school stuff. This
should be pretty obvious for those
watching Amiga productions.«»

Who are the groups releasing crap? I
could easily name them, but that
would serve no point, you all know who
they are by watching productions and
being objective. The only thing
shielding these releases from scathing
reviews is the fact that there are so
few releases, and it is seen as
critical to be 'nice' to the few who
are still active. Well, I don't care
about niceness if someone is flooding
the scene with uninspired crap
because they are too lazy to do any
better. I really don't think we need
that kind of 'activity', though I
believe we need both fun, friendship
and competition. Just don't make the
mistake of confusing the one with the
other, we don't need crap in our scene
to have fun, nor do we do the people
releasing crap any service by not
pointing it out to them.«»

However, when reading reviews of Amiga
scene productions, it is clear that
they are all somewhat good in some
way, the reviewers go out of their way
to not be overly negative, and would
do so no matter what they reviewed,
because they are afraid to dissuade
anyone from the Amiga scene by honest
reviews. Objective indeed, right? It's
fun to read those reviews; someone not
knowing the scene might really come to
believe that some AMOS demo made in
1-day with horrible gfx and music was
better than the latest TBL demo,
because the reviewers 'dare' to be
negative in regards to the TBL demo,
as that demo is so obviously the
highest scene art, that some form of
criticism is seen as ok. On the other
hand, if there's no redeeming quality
to be found with a scene release, you
can be sure that reviewers will do
everything they can to avoid writing
this. So, the good gets criticized
while the bad gets praised. A weird
state of affairs, but not uncommon in
situations such as the one the Amiga
scene is in now.«»

With this article, I wanted to make
you consciously aware of this fact.
think about it, check the productions,
am I not right? You might disagree
with me being too harsh, but the trend
is there. Sceners think the Amiga
scene is so fragile right now, that
they must not discourage ANY form of
activity, or otherwise it might die a
final death. However, maybe this view
is exactly what might be able to close
the coffin on the Amiga scene? After
all, what people remember fondly from
their time in the Amiga scene is the 
creativity and the friendship, 
certainly not crappy productions.«»
