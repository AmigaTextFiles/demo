MAG REVIEW 2005«»
«c3»«»
By Darkhawk of IRIS«»
«c2»«»«as»
Looking at the diskmag published in
recent years, we have an ok number of
releases, in fact more than just a few
years ago, when also counting the new
chart Versus. 2004 saw releases of the
EC, Jurassic Park, Saxonia, Versus and
Cows n' Snakefights. In terms of
quantity, this is a lot, in terms of
quality however, it is next to
impossible for any of these mags to
beat the golden age of diskmags, when
there was a lot of support and
professionalism invested into it.
However, in my opinion, the diskmag
scene is, all things considered, doing
well these days. I don't want to
review the 2004 releases, although I
missed doing that due to the long
interval between issue 47 and this
issue, instead I will review the mags
having been released in 2005.«»
«»
As usual, I will review objectively
and somewhat on the critical side,
i.e., I won't be overly friendly,
unless I think it is warranted. On the
other hand, I am not in a position
where I need to be biased (you may
analyze into this sentence whatever
you like), so I think I can be quite
fair here. You can be the judge of
that, of course.«»

JURASSIC PACK #13«»
«c2»«»
The announcetro, made with AMOS
features a quite ok tune, good
graphics and simple code,
displaying/scrolling pictures, and with
one scroller to boot. It was done by
the guys in Moods Plateau, and so is
the mag itself, though it is in
cooperation with Scarab.«»
«»
The gallery for this issue is somewhat 
weak, the pictures are old and not too
interesting. The music by Genetix of 
Mangoo is fitting enough, and
the title picture by Fireball of Scarab
of a girl is good, albeit typical. The
code was done by Dodge of Moods
Plateau and works well, though
quitting the gallery it is a bit 
confusing.«»
«»
Code wise, the mag is the same, though
a few bugs might have gotten cleaned
out. The original code was done by
Xeron of IRIS back in the days, but is
now being maintained and updated by
Stingray of Scarab. The code is
functional and has the features you'd
expect of a mag, though there's
nothing fancy in it either. It works,
multitasks and runs in whatever
resolution you'd like.«»
«»
As for music, Jurassic Pack has always
been quite the musicdisk, and this
time it is no exception, with 6
modules being offered. As usual, I
think this is a waste of modules,
since you're going to read through the
mag faster than you can possibly start
to appreciate the modules. 3 modules
would have been more fitting in my
opinion. The best ones are the tunes
by Reed of Fairlight and Maze of
Apathy and Moods Plateau.«»
«»
The two titlepictures as well as the
exit picture for the mag are actually 
very good in a quality  minimalist 
way, and have been done by Dan Dee of
Scarab. The panels look fitting, and
its colour scheme pleasing to the eyes.«»
«»
Now, looking at the content of this
issue, there are quite some articles,
around 70, though many could be called
fillers and some are divided so as to
fill up more space. Ghandy does this
with his demospotting articles in
particular, which is a cheap (and
unnecessary) way of getting more
articles. Also those particular fast
reviews of productions are quite
shallow. Apart from that however, JP
13 does have a lot of content, some of
it also fresh, though most is not
focused on news this time around.
The feel of the mag is influenced by
Zito quitting (or halfway being forced
out maybe) the scene, his old articles
are still included, but it is now
Ghandy who is firmly and solely at the
helm of the mag, along with Gone as
his for this issue very active 
co-editor.«»
«»
All in all I enjoyed reading issue #13
of JP, but I wouldn't say that there's
something for all tastes here, nor
that everybody will be satisfied with
the quality. For me however, it was an
entertaining and interesting read,
with an ok amount of articles.«»
«c4»«»
VERSUS #2«»
«c2»«»
Here I should really be biased, and it
would be quite understandable to think
so, but I will still try to be
objective, since I don't feel the EC
is threatened by this alternative
chart, there is space enough for both
the EC and Versus, and the EC is well 
off no matter what charts are out
there.«» 
«»
Issue one was a very simple affair to
be sure, but issue two has improved
quite a lot compared to issue 1 in
regards to functionality, graphics and
overall presentation. To be fair, that
was not such a hard task in itself, as
issue one was below minimalist,
indeed it looked even more retro than
the first Amiga diskmags released in
the middle to late eighties.«»
«»
Graphics are made by Browallia of
Nukleus, who is also the editor of the
issue together with Rumrunner of Void.
Browallia has a love for nudity, which
is fine, so we are treated to a
lowres, 8-16 colour picture of a woman
masturbating. While the motive is
interesting, the actual symmetry, lack
of details and overall technical
finesse makes this picture rather ugly.
Especially the face of the girl looks
more like an invading alien than a
sexy girl. Sorry, but I don't think I
am being overly harsh here, that's
just the honest truth.«»
«»
The panels, also made by
Browallia, are light brownish, simple
and approaching ugly (you could also
say they look 'retro' if you prefer).
There is also one picture of two nude
girls having an arm wrestling match
behind the text being displayed in
this issue. While Browallia's ideas for
his motives are often interesting and
symbolic, the actual implementation of
these ideas are in my opinion lacking
a lot. You cannot just defend yourself
with being a pixel graphician, that
doesn't mean it is ok that proportions
are all wrong for instance. If
more time and care was invested, so
that motive and implementation
approached each other, I think
Browallia would, ahehm, 'penetrate'
better into the gfx charts.«»
«»
There are two modules, which you
can flip between with a click on the
right mouse button. The first one is
made by dIS of Nukleus, and is
a(nother) chip remake of Flight to
Cambodia. As such, it does sound ok.
The second one is a quite uninspired
module by Curt Cool of Depth, and
there's not much more to be said here.«»
«»
The actual layout of the chart is very
simple, and yet markedly improved from
issue 1. You can now scroll through
the charts by pressing the arrow
buttons or clicking with the mouse on
some arrows in the panel. Also, you
can click on boxes representing each
chart section to go to that page.
There is also a scroller running, and
you can access messages and a list of
voters by pressing help. Very basic,
but it works ok with what is
available. The code has been done by
Rumrunner of Void.«»
«»
As for the chart itself, they have the
usual problems getting people to vote,
and the amounts of voters is in my
opinion far below what is needed for
major credibility. However, that might
be biased, coming from my mouth. After
months of collecting, they managed to
get 43 votes for this issue. I know
how hard and draining the task of
vote collecting is, and if the staff
has to fight for months to collect 43
votes, then it is really an up hill
battle.«» 
«»
Overall, Versus is simple, ugly and 
short of votes. The charts seem to be
somewhat representative though, with
newer releases on them than what we in
the EC had before our new rules.
Although more votes are needed, the
actual charts seem interesting and
new, that is, not too bad, all things
considered.«» 
«»
So, the conclusion? I for one would 
like to see Versus continue and 
improve along the way for sure, but
only overly nice people would say
(with their eyes and ears closed) 
that the mag is of an ok quality as 
it is.«»
«c4»«»
COWS N' SNAKEFIGHTS #6«»
«c2»«»
The sixth issue of this traditional
'interview' mag came hot on the heels
of issue 5, at least comparing to the
time between the other issues, and in
this issue, the makers also announce
more articles, more support and a
quick release of CnS 7, so it should
be safe to say that CnS wants to be a
player in the diskmag scene from
release 5 and onwards.«»
«»
Cows and Snakefights, or CnS for
short, has been made almost
exclusively by members of Nukleus
until now, with Browallia as the
main-editor. Earlier issues have
focused almost exclusively on
interviews, and have had some very
interesting ones. This time, the feel
is more like a fully fledged mag in
regards to articles. We'll get to that
in a moment.«»
«»
Codewise, there aren't the big
whistles in the mag, but it is
functional, you can use both mouse and
keys, you can search, it supports
clipart, and it multitasks. There is 
not much else to say about the code, 
other than it works and has some 
features above the absolute minimum. 
The magengine was done by Joru, who 
also did the code for the intro.«»
«»
There are three modules, two from dIS
of Nukleus and one from Curt Cool.
Banana Party by dIS is absolutely
stressing for the ears when reading,
and quite retro. Not bad, but not my
cup of tea for concentrating on the
articles to be sure. Zum Altschool by
Curt Cool is short and features a nice
passage, but is otherwise somewhat
repetitive. Stand by Me by dIS is a
4chn version of the song, and is also
quite hard on both ears and
concentration when reading.«»
«»
As with Versus #2, Browallia did
the gfx for this mag, and again, there
is a girl involved as the intro picture
for the mag. This picture is part of
the intro for the mag, with code by
Joru and music by dIS. The intro is
short and confusing, with a killer
clown and a scantily clad girl, a
sperm cell and some ugly fonts. It
lasts for some seconds, and is nothing
you'll remember. However, the two
pictures are the best of the gfx for
the mag.«»
«»
The panels and especially colours for
this issue are absolutely ugly and
discomforting to look at. In issue 5,
some people disliked the autumn
inspired theme, but I rather liked it.
This time however, there is nothing
interesting or nice about anything in
regards to the panels and diskmag
colours. There are a number of
clipart, that have some good
motives, but again, most don't look
too good, and the reason for this is
probably not that they are in low
resolution, pixel drawn with few 
colours. After all, Kings Quest I 
(enhanced version to be fair) looked 
better in 1989, with the same 
resolution and colours.«»
«»
Looking at the articles, there are
actually quite a few, and although
there won't be something for every
taste, there are articles on many
topics. Browallia is especially proud
of a scene survey (criticizing my own
before starting his, a trend
continued throughout the entire mag), 
where a number of sceners are asked 
several questions, with their answers
then analyzed. This survey is
multiplatform and deals with thoughts
about the different scenes, the
computers, etc. Interview wise the
interview with a previous developer on
DPaint IV is probably the most
interesting. Other than that, there
are party reports, stories, thoughts
and EC slagging. In other words
everything you expect to find in a
mag. However, the 'innovative' new
way of navigating these articles is a
pain in my arse at least. Instead of a
list of contents, you decide whether
you want to browse through the
articles in either article or section 
mode. The first entails you
using the up and down arrows to flip
articles, or you click on the name of
the desired article in a small bar at
the bottom of the screen. This bar
does not list all articles, so you
will have to scroll with the arrow
keys in any case to get to an article
not listed. The section mode is with
sections in the bottom bar instead of
articles. It takes some time getting
used to, and I do not think it is more
effective or very innovative. It is 
however a new way of doing this, and 
as such, deserves a try out. Instead 
of reading about it, you should of 
course try it out yourselves. I 
missed some articles in the first read 
through, because this design  
confused me initially. Yes, yes, I 
might be a total simpleton of course, 
it is possible.«»
«»
Otherwise, when reading this issue, 
one gets the impression that the staff 
is tired of criticism, and don't want 
to listen to it, as we are reminded of 
in several articles. If we think 
something about CnS or if Nukleus sucks, 
we should just shut up and go away. 
Now why is Nukleus so aggressively 
defensive about this? In fact they are
so preoccupied with this that they 
even put a screen with some text 
stating the abovementioned, as the 
first thing displayed in the intro. 
Apart from being incredibly 
irrelevant, it makes me think that 
there is justice to the criticism they 
think people have, because why try to 
stop it this much otherwise? Whatever, 
it doesn't stop me from reviewing them, 
but I thought it a lame thing to 
continuously try to drive home, in 
order to shield themselves. If they 
don't care about this (as they have 
also stated), then there would have 
been no reason to explicitly state 
this. Oh well...«»
«»
CnS is ugly, but worth reading, and
with a quite ok number of articles.
The language in these sports both
typos and grammatical errors, but it
can be read. The topics deal with both
scene and non-scenish things, and it
all has a somewhat limited scope, in
that the entire production feels very
'Swedish' or rather, one group has
been responsible for almost
everything, down to almost all the
articles. This is both good and bad,
and not something I will criticize,
except to point it out. Overall, any
scener should find something to read 
in here, but if Nukleus wants to get 
up in the next league, they need to 
make some efforts. However, as we 
are repeatedly told, they don't care 
about such opinions.«»

JURASSIC PACK #14«»
«c2»«»
Two issues of the same mag reviewed.
This must mean the new EC issue has 
been rather long in arriving. True
enough, and Ghandy has managed to
bring out two mags with just half a
year between them, something that is
regarded as 'fast' in the scene of
today.«»
«»
The announcetro for JP #14 was coded by
Todi of Tulou, and it is the best intro 
I've seen for a mag in some time now. 
It is not fantastic, but it is good,
surprisingly so, since you've come to
regard diskmag intros as nothing
special in recent times. Also, the
module by Maze of Apathy and Moods
Plateau is very fitting to the
action too.«»
«»
The gallery for this issue is a fine
piece of work by Stingray, with a
nice, colourful zoomer and some
fade in/out routines, that works well.
The title picture of the gallery by
Frost is nothing fancy, but the tune
by is quite good. The pictures are a
mix of old and new, no nude action or
wildly shocking pictures, but overall
the gallery feels kinda' cosy.«»
«»
The code is still the same as reviewed
some ways up in this article, done and
maintained by Stingray of Scarab now,
and originally developed by Xeron of
IRIS.«» 
«»
Bridgeclaw of Gods did the intro
picture for JP#14, and naturally this
picture is in a league of its own, him
being an old, talented and experienced
graphician, one of those we don't have
in the Amiga scene anymore. The exit
picture by Pix is good too however,
though in a different style. Frost of 
Tulou made the second title picture,
and it is a nice, simple, relaxing
pixelled alien landscape, the kind
I like.«» 
«»
As for panels, they have a red hue on
them and are nothing fancy in terms of
extras and details, but they look
fine, and the colour scheme is well
chosen. They were done by Dan Dee of
Scarab.«» 
«»
Once again, JP is giving me stress in
regards to how many modules I have to
listen through in order to review the
mag. 7 modules to listen to, and only
50 or so articles. I have a feeling
that many musicians sort of waste
their mods, as not many will listen
through all mods. I might be mistaken
of course. In any case, the best mod
in my opinion, is the one from Bzh
called 'Return of the Summer'. A very
pleasing, melodic module full of charm
and real oldschool (i.e. quality)
style. At least that's what I think,
and thus I've added it to my module
collection. This doesn't happen often
these days.«»
«»
There are not as many articles in JP 
#14 as we have been used to in 
previous issues - not counting the
editorial stuff, there are around 50.
Also, this issue has probably been
quite a struggle to finish for Ghandy,
as he lost Gone (gone to real life),
and now stands as more or less the
only major and stable writer in the
mag. Be that as it may, this issue is
still very worthwhile to read,
especially if you like news and info
based articles. This is a very fresh,
very convincing issue in that regard.«»
«»
Sure, there are a few fillers, like
the review of Star Wars III (ok, not a
filler, but still surprising finding
it amidst all the scene related
material), and the demospotting
articles are still as standard as
ever, but all in all, a very fresh
issue. Not many articles, but most are
researched info/news articles.
Personally I would also like more in
depth slandering, opinionated
feelings, etc., but that's more me as
an editor than the average scener I 
think, and thus JP#14 succeeds well 
as a news based mag.«»
«c4»«»
VERSUS 3«»
«c2»«»
'Just' before the EC release, Versus 
issue 3 was released, and naturally I
included it here.«»
«»
Ok, the chartmag has gotten a bit more
voters, though it seems these voters
are quite selective, and somewhat
centred around voting for German
stuff when possible. This possibly
presents a bit of a problem, but you
can compare our charts to the ones
featured in Versus, to form your own
opinion of course.«»
«»
Versus 3 is still, and I mean this in
the most neutral, objective way
possible, quite ugly in its
presentation. I feel bad for
repeatedly saying that, and maybe I
should just stay silent, since
everyone seems to acknowledge this
fact, but not everyone wants to hear
(or read) it. The background picture
of an angel is, once again, a good
motive, but not very well done, the
fonts are annoyingly pointy (and with
a border of black, probably due to
engine limitations) and the panels
are.. Blocky, amongst other things.
Sorry, but there's a long way to go in
terms of presentation. Maybe I should
just be happy that we have groups who
release something these days (and I
am!), and maybe I shouldn't be so
harsh, since it might upset said
groups, so that they won't release
anything ever again (not very likely,
instead I think I give them a reason
to write lots and lots of flaming
articles against me, hehe), but come
on. White is white, black is black,
and Versus is an example of an Amiga
scene that has partly broken in two,
with the older, experienced, talented
groups disconnected from the rest (and
only a few groups in the middle).«»
«»
This is fine, as long as there is
progress, but there doesn't seem to be
progress, things are standing more or
less still for Versus. There have been 'suggestions'
from people that the gfx are handled
by someone else for the next issue,
which might indeed be a good idea.«»
«»
So, on the positive, there are a few
articles included too, and.. Well, it
is a chart, and it gets released,
there is something positive in that
too.«» 
«»
On the so-so side, I think there's a
bit of a bias in the votes of this
issue and there are not that many
votes either (42 - a nice number
otherwise).«»
«»
On the negative, presentation is still
'simple' - and oldsk00l is no excuse,
looking at the old Amiga 500 mags such
as RAW, Upstream, Eurochart, etc.«»
«»
Ironically, the intro picture is quite
nice, though it has been scaled down.
Turns out it is a picture by Matarazzo
of IRIS, who has left the scene. I am
fairly certain we used the picture for
something years ago, possibly our
Miracle #1 issue, but since Browallia
hasn't asked my permission to use it,
I hope he has at least contacted
Matarazzo and asked him about it.
Still, the intro picture does some
good for the chartmag.«»
«»
As for other credits, Browallia of 
Nukleus did the remaining graphics, 
Slicer did the simple, but so-so music, 
and Rumrunner of Void did the code, 
which is the same as in the last 
issue, as far as I can see.«»
«»
With that, I close my diskmag review,
and if this sparks off a fury of
'«c3»We hate Darkhawk' «c2»articles, that
would amuse me a bit. If it sparks off
silence, that is fine too. And my
fondest hope is that you have gotten
something from these somewhat
extensive reviews, something positive
that can be used to stimulate and/or
inform you.«»
«»
With that simple hope, I sign off for 
now.«»
