CALL TO ARMS«»

The EC, particularly with issue 48 and future issues, is a huge project. it needs a lot of support in order to live up to its responsibility towards the scene, and it needs a lot of content in order to be the best chart AND mag
around.«»
«»
While we could indeed do most of the work ourselves (as we have done, agh), it is best for everyone if we get a high degree of mixed support from all around the scene. At times were the scenes of most platforms are shrinking, it is vitally important for us as a scene to rally to something solid, something that can bring out new motivation. The Eurochart aims to be such a rallying point - we would be a very poor rallying point indeed, if we didn't have a broad range of topics, a huge amount of voters, a lot of different gfx and music, and so
on.«»
«»
What is all boils down to is that if you are in any way creative and have some skill that can see a use in the Eurochart - please support us, and thereby yourself. We need a solid rock in the scene, and we can be that rock, if you will but help
us.«»

SEND US YOUR SOULS«»
«c2»«»
.. Figuratively speaking. But send us articles, music (sid, mod, xm, dbm, mp3/ogg) and votes. If you want to do the graphical layout for an issue, contact us via email. Keep in mind that we have three different diskmag engines, and you can do the graphics for any one (or all of them, if you're feeling
masochistic).«»
«»
In regards to articles, we welcome articles dealing with scenish topics of all kinds, and we welcome articles dealing with Amiga related topics. We could especially have wished for more support from the AOS4 and MOS camps, seeing as how we have struggled to bring out a chartmag geared for the future of the Amiga, running on all Amigas but the OCS/ECS ones. If you want a 'new' Amiga scene centred on the PPC processor, and if you want to have people stimulated into making productions for it, you should consider writing articles about this for the
EC.«»
«»
We also need help with updating our database of releases (www.eurochart.dk), especially if we are going to put in older releases too (you won't be able to vote for them, but it would be great to build up a complete database of releases, hosted on a high-speed server). Again, contact us via email if you want to help us out
there.«»

CROSS PLATFORM SUPPORT«»
«c2»«»
As you will have noticed, this is a major cross-platform release. The Eurochart has until now always been about the Amiga scene and Amiga scene charts. This has not changed, nor will it change. However, with the added amount of readers we might now get from the C64 and PC scenes, we would like to receive support from these scenes too - it will be very welcome, and we would love to become a rallying point for all the scenes. That is very much up to the C64 and PC scene though, as we would NOT love doing 3 times the work to be a chartmag for all scenes. If you would like another C64 mag, another PC mag, then send in your support, and we will make a space for your scene too - we would like to offer something for everybody, but we will also stay anchored in the Amiga ourselves. Thus we need an influx of sceners onto our team, if we are to adequately cover other
scenes.«»
«»
If you don't think you can support us with anything, but still would like to support - send us an email, and we might have a job for you. We really need to gauge how much support and help we can get, before expanding our coverage to other scenes. As it is, we aim to be a mag that can be read by any scener, but especially enjoyed if you happen to be an Amiga
scener.«»

FIGHTING ALONE..«»
«c2»«»
Is possible, but in the end, we would fade out. If you don't help us, so that we can bring out the EC, we will nevertheless keep up the fight, but it won't be the same, nor will it last for as long without your help. So please, if you ever thought a project was worth supporting in whatever way, support this project. It is a big, ambitious, continuing project, and we believe it is what is needed if we are going to motivate the (Amiga especially, of course) scene and secure it for the
future.«»
