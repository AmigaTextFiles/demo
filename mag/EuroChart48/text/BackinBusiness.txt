Six years or more passed since my last
article appeared on Showtime. 
Six   years   since  my   (un)official 
retirement from the scene. 
Today, six years later,  while the sun
is high and bright in the sky and  the
calendar on my  desk  reports 19  June
2004 here I am back,once again writing 
articles for a scene magazine («c1»uhm yeah, sorry, guess it took 7 years before you 
made your official comeback. Uups ;-) - ED).«»

At present it seems quite strange  to  be
in  front  a  text  editor once again, 
writing sentences and thinking about what to 
write, but the more minutes pass  the more 
my mind goes back in time when  I  was 
writing articles for  Showtime,  while 
listening  Iron Maiden 
or Metallica playing in the background. That was back then when my A4000/060/PPC 
was  still  alive.  Many years passed, 
many events unfolded, many things changed...«»

Now, let's go back to present. 
What woke me up? A couple of days  ago 
the   Amiga   community    has    been 
introduced  to AmigaOS4,  while  AmigaOne 
has  already  been a  reality  for some  time. 
This  fact brought  my  curiosity  and 
interest back to the Amiga scene.
In the last days I have  been  quite 
active  investigating AmigaOS4 and 
its hardware platform,  and  find  it
very attractive for various reasons. «»

After that investigation, it was time
to have a look at what was going on  in
the demo scene. 
Obviously  after  6  years  all  seems 
much smaller. Many of my friends  left
in  the   scene   have  moved  or  are 
planning to move to PPC. 
The real Next Generation is being  born  
and  I  could not miss the event. «»
