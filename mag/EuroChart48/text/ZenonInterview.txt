GROUP INTERVIEW WITH ZENON«»
«»
«c3»By Darkhawk of IRIS«»
«c1»«»«as»
«c4»D: «c1»Hello and welcome to this group interview with the small Finnish crew
Zenon. Please introduce yourself to our readers before we begin with the
questions.«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»Hi there, I'm Mikko "Mice" Ahola. Born in 1979. In Zenon I'm a 
musician, graphician and Mr. Public Relations.«»
«»
«c5»<Buzzer> «c2»I'm Mikko "Buzzer" Hyyti, musician, 29 years old.«»
«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»I'm Tapio "Tohe" Koivuniemi, and I try to be a coder and graphician. 
And most probably failing with both. :)«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»For how long has Zenon been active, and what have been released so
far?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»We've been active since 1991, the first actual intro was released summer 
1992. We've released a few intros, demos and chip-packs. I guess our 'GooGoo'-
series is something that has lasted so long that it's something to be proud 
of...«»
«»
«c5»<All> «c2»We're probably most happy with The Way, Bees and Broken Promises.«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»Tell us a bit about the members of Zenon over the years.«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»In the beginning there were me and brm. (I guess his nickname was 
Petze or Deadbeat back then), then of course some graphics were drawn for the 
first intro by our friends (currently as support-members: Dr.Chain (now Randy :) 
and Woodpecker) - Soon after the first intro, we started our pack-series 'Cute-
pack' and Buzzer and Chronic joined our forces.«»
«»
In 1995 we met Mare (Manux), and in a few months he became part of the Zenon-
family and since that everything is history :) Manux was the one that was really 
active with coding new effects and a quite ok 3D-engine. Back in 1998 Mice 
joined us, he is the one that has kept Zenon alive the last few years (kicking 
our butts to do something during that time...).«»
«»
Then there was our BBS 'Graveyard', which was operated by Dominator. We met him
at Abduction a few years later, he was a really nice guy...«»
«»
Of course we also had swappers (Chronic, Nemesis, Loop...)«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»Me, Tohe, Buzzer, Mare and Brm. have always been the most active 
members. I guess only one member has ever been kicked out of the group and 
one (Deetail - ex. Gore) has quit. The rest of the bunch are still members, but 
inactive.«»
«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»... That one guy just deserved to be kicked out :) BTW. all of our 
members have been Finnish (and unfortunately males too :)).«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»What releases have you been the most happy with, and why?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»I like our 'Bees'-demo most. As for my own work, for 'KickAss'-intro I 
did my best to get it running well on A500 and it actually did :) Regarding 
graphics I like the stuff I made for 'Bees' and 'Broken Promises' and of course 
I'm proud of winning the Motorola Inside graphics competition with my really old 
A500 Lo-res picture (thanks to Mice, who found that on his disks :))«»
«»
«c5»<Buzzer> «c2»Broken Promises v1.1, released at the Abduction 1997 - party in Oulu, 
1st Place in the democompo (AGA). I'm also proud of being 4th in the Assembly'94 
4ch competition.«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»I also think that "Bees" is our best demo so far. But since I haven't 
got anything to do with it, I'll have to say that "The Way" is the latest 
and the greatest ;) Best personal achievement must be 2nd place in the
Abdution'98 music-competition, or something...«»
«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»... Yep, "The Way" was ok a little bit more time and it would have been 
a gem...«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»Do you know how Zenon got founded, and the history following that?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»Tohe & Brm. (at that time known as Petze) founded Zenon in 1991. You 
can read more about our history in the previous answers by Tohe. I've actually 
known the Zenon guys since 1991, but it took me about 7 years
of composing before I was good enough to join this group.. Or maybe they just 
needed someone to keep the group alive and active ;)«»
«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»Our first actual piece of code was an easy menusystem with a picture and 
a module playing, and via function keys you could start some intros etc. For 
the first intro I remember fighting with a random-number generator (with 68k ASM 
ofcourse), random numbers were used for a sprite 2d star-field. I guess with 
UAE you can still achieve situations where sprites are drawn in one line
:)«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»Regarding the name Zenon, what is the story behind this name?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»It just sounded great :) Of course Mice can explain the mythology 
around it... :)«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»Ehm.. well... no comments..«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»What's the status in the group nowadays? Who are members, who are active,
what are your plans?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<All> «c2»To beat FIT! HAHAHAH!«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»In other words, we're still active and trying to do some new stuff 
for the Amigascene. Me, Tohe, Manux(Mare) and Buzzer are still active. Also Brm. 
might do something, someday, somewhere, somehow... The rest of the group is 
(more or less) dead.«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»About Googoo, how long have you been releasing it, and what is the
story behind this release?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»The first GooGoo was released in 1994 and the latest issue was released 
in December 2004. There should be about 10 issues of those and of course we 
had to make people confused so there're actually 2 issues of GooGoo#1 and 
GooGoo#2. I guess there's no special story behind GooGoo, Zenon just needed 
a chippack for spreading some nice chiptunes by Brm., Buzzer and Gore. Then 
suddenly it became my responsibility (surprise, surprise ;)) to release new 
GooGoo's.. Well actually I always wanted to have my own chippack so I 
shouldn't complain. Btw. You should check the original issues #1 and #2 and 
press the joystick-button for hidden-parts.«»
«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»Yep those hiddenparts are kewl, there is a nice moomin-part in #2 and 
in #1 there's the legendary '4 iloista veikkoa' composed by Brm. It's just one 
of the greatest chiptunes ever written by anyone...«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»Googoo has come under attack for being too simple in regards to graphics
and interface. What are your thoughts about this, and will we see changes to
the chippack in the future?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»Keep it simple stupid... :) We have thought about changing it, but
as we're so simple guys we don't have any good ideas... So gimme some ideas 
MICE! Actually I'm not even sure if there are any interested people left, so is 
it worth it to update the interface?!?«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»Ideas? *cough* Well we have been talking about AHI-support and a simple 
menu so you could choose AGA or Cybergraphics. Personally I think that a 
chippack doesn't really need AHI, but since we like our productions to work on 
Pegasos/PPC/etc. that would be a good thing, or something.. I'm the one who has 
to do all the graphics so there won't be any improvements there and I hope that 
Buzzer would compose more chiptunes so I wouldn't have to do those all by myself 
too :)«»
«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»It already supports CGFX/AGA (I guess it's now selected automatically?), 
but please just spam Mice with those ideas how to improve it, and we will
:)«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»How has it been doing Googoo, and why is it the only thing Zenon has done
for ages?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»Only thing?!? What about my 'KickAss'-intro from 1995 or was it 1994 
;) Please watch the 'Bees'-demo (from Aminet or our www-page)...«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»It might have something to do with our coders and their perversion called 
"real life" :) Second reason is that we don't have any REAL graphicians, most of 
the graphics are done by me and Tohe.«»
«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»HEY, I've just won the graphics competition and you say that I'm not an 
REAL graphician... don't push your luck to be 'the second guy' :)«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»Heeheh.. That's the organizer for you ;-)«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»I've being composing music for groups like Scarab, IRIS, Artway, RNO, 
Schitzophrenic, etc. So I've been active all the time. But I've also been 
busy with school, work, my "real" band Body By JAYK 
(http://www.freewebs.com/bbjayk) and I've been composing some coop-tunes 
with Buzzer for some dvd's etc. so I haven't had too much time for Amiga :( 
But I'll try to release GooGoo#11 in 2005 anyway.. Maybe another 
Xmas-special or something :)«»

«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»What has been your best memory to take with you from the scene?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Buzzer> «c2»Propably being drunk @ MI2004 with the Zenon-gang and watching demos 
there, or visiting Assembly or sumthing.«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»Watching new demos, meeting old & new friends at the parties - 
Motorola Inside 2004-trip must be one of the greatest. Hard to say which is 
the best memory, maybe it's just the memory of watching those A500-demos for 
the first time OR maybe it's when I got my A1200 and saw Polka B. 
productions, etc. OR maybe it's when I finally got my 060 OR... :)«»
«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»Yep Motorola Inside 2004 was great...'ole kuin kotonasi' :)«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»Looking at the Amiga scene of today, what is good and what is bad?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Buzzer> «c2»GOO«c4»D: «c1»Amiga! BA«c4»D: «c1»It's mostly 8-bit samples and 4ch. More demos 
should be released.«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»Good that it's still alive :) Bad that there isn't too many new 
sceners nor releases and the old sceners are getting, ehm, old.«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»Thanks for the reminder ;- ) Do you still think the scene is worth your time 
and effort?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Buzzer> «c2»Absolutely ;)«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»Ofcoz! And trust me - I'm not going to be the one who strikes the 
last nail to its' coffin ;D«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»What about the potentially new Amiga scenes, on Amiga One and Pegasos, is
that something that has trickled your fancy?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Buzzer> «c2»We are oldskool oriented X)«»
«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»Actually I have an Pegasos, but there won't be any 'new Amiga-scene'. 
Amiga scene is only about the classic Amiga, but of course it won't do any harm 
if your production works on Pegasos, PPC-amiga or AmigaOne.«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»Pegasos would be nice, but I think that I'll stick to my 060 and 
won't be buying a Pegasos in the near future... Maybe when I win in the 
lottery ;)«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»Where are you seeing yourself in 10 years time, both as a group and as
individuals?«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»We're still going strong, just about to release GooGoo #50 (with the same 
interface :) As my kids will be much older, I think I'll have more time to spend 
with my Amiga's then ;)«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»Exactly! Zenon will still be alive because I'm still doing stuff for 
the dead scene (AND I will be using the same codes as I use today since 
everyone else will have quit the scene ;D)«»
«»
«c5»<All> «c2»We'll stay in touch on IRC and hold group-meetings at least once per 
1-3 years :)«»
«c1»«»
«c4»D: «c1»And with that, I guess we conclude this interview. However, feel free to
play around greeting people, firing off last words, etc., now.«»
«c2»«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»Watch out Marq, see you at Motorola 2006 :)«»
«»
«c5»<Buzzer> «c2»Greetings to Nectarine. Mice and I have planned to make some more 
co-operation music in the future.«»
«»
«c5»<Tohe> «c2»And I couldn't care less about that co-operation.«»
«»
«c5»<Mice> «c2»That's becoz you suck :) Anyway, no official greetings this time, but 
respect to everyone who still uses Amiga!«»
