Coders Crack-Down/Rise of 3d artists«»

Since the introduction  of  new,  powerful
hardware  that   met the requirements  of 
professional 3d modelling software, we have 
seen a great progression of 3d art.«»
«»
And slowly a new scene career 
appeared with many talented 3d artists.
In the beginning  they had little 
prestige, but nowadays the situation is
the opposite.«»

«c4»Massive 3D«»«c2»
«»
Having a look at  productions  released 
in the latest years we surely notice a
massive use of 3D scenes.«»
«»
90% of demos are made up by 3d engines
and animation  scenes.  Hard  to  find 
bi-dimensional effects. And if you find 
them, they are  the  old  and  usual 
routines.«»
«»
Once a coder has a decent 
3d engine in his hands, he has already done  the  core 
of the demo. Next  step  relays  work into
the hands of  a  3d artist  who  will 
work on objects, textures and scenes..«»

«c4»Is that not so ?«»«c2»

Let's stress that this article  is
not against 3d graphicians or  against
coders. It only wants  to   reflect on a
point of view of a typical scener.«»

«c4»Back to us...«»«c2»

Coding is very much a question of maths and
logic. It has always been possible  to
invent new  things,  to  improve  old 
effects,  to  use nice transitions and 
so on.....  unless  we  must  follow  the 
'better to not optimize' pc trend ?«»
«»
How many time is passed since the last time that:
"xxx has invented"   or  "xxx record",
substitute x with the name of a demo crew.«»
«»
Just remember old demos, and  how  many
times we have read i.e.:
"Sanity has invented"«»
«»
Maybe the best expression to value the 
ability of coders  are  4k intros  and 
40k intros.«»
«»
At least now we have new  hardware  
to beat  previous  coding  limits, and 
someone  is  beginning to demonstrate 
it.«»
