«c4»INTRODUCTION«»
«»
«c1»As a short introduction, please tell the readers a few words about
yourself, which computer scene you're a part of and what you want to
achieve in the scene.«»
«c2»«»
Well, the usual geek-stuff I guess. Got my first C16 at the age of 8 
or so, and as it didn't have a tape drive, all I could possibly do 
with it was trying to code in basic and try to understand the English 
manual. Around 1988, I got a C64. After getting the first demos 
from Public Domain Disk shops, I got interested in the scene. Around 
1990 I met an older guy going to the same school as I. This guy was 
Bionic/Tropic, who was a GFX artist and swapper if I recall correctly. 
As he was about to quit the scene, he handed me over his ~300 disks of 
scene related material he got from his contacts. This way I got myself 
an impressingly huge collection of intros and demos to study and also a 
few mail swapping contacts. I also wrote 2 crappy demos myself, but 
those didn't get spread far I guess. While back then the Amiga looked 
impressive, I couldn't afford it and instead started playing around on 
the PC my father had bought. It was the PC I really started coding on 
and produced quite some stuff, including the best SID player in good 
old MS-Dos times (together with rom/vacuum, who did the main work). In 
1994 I also founded the first scene-related German Fidonet-Forum ("Echo"), 
szene.ger, which got me lots more contacts. Ok, enough of that, this 
paragraph is getting too long.«»
«c1»«»
What do you find so fascinating with the scene?«»
«c2»«»
The tolerance. It's great to be part of such community that completely 
disregards nationality and race, and manages to integrate even the 
most weird minds. There is no dress-code, there rarely are taboos 
regarding what you do or say - it's community that has tons of freedom 
for the individual while still giving you a family feeling. Great 
stuff.«»
«»
«c4»GROUPS«»
«c1»«»
Please tell us a few words about Vacuum, and what you're doing for this  
group?«» 
«c2»«»
Actually Vacuum is pretty inactive these days. The group was founded 
by me in the early 90s, and meanwhile the whole memberlist changed 
several times with people retiring from the scene. The release we once 
were most known for was VacSID, the ultimate SID player for MSDOS back 
in those days - the emulation beat Sidplays ones hands-down, and it 
had a very neat interface. Back at.. Wired'96 (I think, might also be 
Wired'95) we also released the first 64k intro on the PC featuring SID 
music. Also there have been some demos released by us. My job in the 
group obviously is being the founder and leader, and coder.«»
«c1»«»
What do you think are the good and bad sides of your group?«»
«c2»«»
The bad side probably is that the people I once loved working together 
with are no longer part of the scene. The good side is that after more 
than 10 years, it still more or less exists ;)«»
«c1»«»
How important do you think it is for a group to have good organizing and 
real friendship between the members? Is it important at all?«» 
«c2»«»
The real friendship stuff isn't so important. What's important is that 
you are able to work together in a productive way.«»
«c1»«»
What's your all-time favourite group? And why?«»
«c2»«»
Can't really answer that. A lot of groups achieved lots of totally 
different things on different platforms.«»
«c1»«»
What's the next release we'll see from your group?«»
«c2»«»
Hopefully a demo in 2005, but well, all this party organizing is 
eating most of my spare time already, so I don't know for sure yet.«»
«c1»«»
Which own-made production are you most satisfied with?«»
«c2»«»
Probably Vacsid. Honestly the release I'm really satisfied with isn't 
done yet.«»
«»
«c4»DEMOS«»
«c1»«»
Tell us about your favourite production?«»
«c2»«»
No, I won't, for the reasons stated above :)«»
«c1»«»
Do you think it's ok to include animations in demos/intros?«»
«c2»«»
Yes. "Konsum" by Farbrausch and my own stuff is a clear sign that 
there are situations where animations in demos can achieve nice 
effects.«»
«c1»«»
Are there too many 3d-routines and too few 2d effects in nowadays 
demos after your opinion?«»
«c2»«»
Yes. But opinion is mostly based on crappy "good old times" thoughts. 
I loved reading scrolltexts when I was young, so I'm missing those 
now etc.«»
«c1»«»
What do you think about nowadays demos, like the demos released at the 
previous Breakpoint parties for instance?«»
«c2»«»
As we all know the demoscene has more or less lost the battle against 
the game industry now. The "look, we can do things with this computer 
hardware none else has done before"-times are over, at least on the 
PC. So people need to impress with other things - good design, humour, 
nice story, good synch etc. I think the demos of today are doing a pretty 
good job with this. As in the past, the scene has managed to adapt to the 
changing environment, so all is fine.«»
«c1»«»
Do you remember the first demo you saw and the first mag you read?«»
«c2»«»
The first demo - no, not really. The first mag I read was probably 
Sex'n'Crime on the C64.«»
«c1»«»
What do you think are the good and bad sides of the scene?«»
«c2»«»
We already had the "good sides of the scene" topic above ;) 
Regarding the bad side: It's sad to see people retire. Personally I 
find it bitter to see that lots of the c64 sceners I admired when I was 
young left the scene years ago, and when they show up again on parties of today 
look like they became total ordinary boring people with boring 
jobs, a boring family, and nothing happening in their lives anymore. 
These guys totally lost the scene feeling and are missing a lot.«»
«c1»«»
How should we manage to get more people attracted to the various computer  
scenes?«»
«c2»«»
It's kinda hard to attract new people in this shiny new computer 
world. Back in the 90ies it was much easier - if you were really 
interested in computer stuff, you sooner or later came into contact 
with the demoscene. Every C64 gamer saw the cracktros before his game 
etc. These days the best way to acquire new talents 
is probably making people aware of the scene - for example in 
school.«»
«c1»«»
As you're mostly a part of the PC scene, do you have any 
knowledge of the Amiga scene? Do you for 
instance remember Amiga productions you liked?«»
«c2»«»
Sure. Planet Potion and Lapsuus come to mind, and of course all the 
great stuff from TBL. The Amiga is an impressing platform. Back in my 
C64 days I hated it simply because I couldn't afford buying an Amiga.«»
«c1»«»
What do you think are the similarities and differences 
between the Amiga and PC scenes?«»
«c2»«»
I guess the Amiga scene is suffering from an identity problem. As said 
above, times have changed - on the PC the scene has drifted away from 
doing pure technical demonstrations of what can be done with the 
hardware over to using the hardware power to improve design etc. The 
Amiga scene, on the other hand, still has to live with hardware 
limitations, and coders on it are often still proud in a "look what I 
managed to create on this old hardware"-kind of way. But a lot of 
today's PC sceners are unable to rate these achievements correctly, 
which is a source of deep conflict. Unlike the PC scene, the Amiga, 
C64 and Atari sceners often think they have to defend their platform 
against the evil dominating PC. I think that's why the PC scene is much 
more relaxed than the other platform scenes these days - their future 
is secured.«»
«c1»«»
Do you have any special scene memory you want to share with the
readers?«»
«c2»«»
No, not really. Too many memories to write down here ;)«»
«»
«c4»THE BREAKPOINT PARTY - http://breakpoint.untergrund.net«»
«c1»«»
You're wide known in the computer scene for being the 
main-organizer of the best scene party the 
latest years. If I remember correctly, you were not a 
part of the old Mekka & Symposium gang, so how did you get 
involved in the Breakpoint party and what was 
your motivation and reason to take part in this event?«»
«c2»«»
No, I wasn't part of M&S organizing. In fact I even got thrown out of 
M&S 2000 after starting a sit-down strike against the crappy and 
violent security team ;)«»
«»
As you may know, M&S ceased to exist due to strong mistrust between 
some of the 'administrative' main organizers. Back then I already had  
friendships with quite a lot of the 'executive' organizers, and quite a few of 
them were already organizers of the Underground Conference party series I 
had been organizing since 1996. Some time before the public 
announcement of M&S's death in November 2002 they informed me about 
what was going on. I understood most of the 'executive' organizers still were 
highly motivated to do another party, but that they didn't have an 
administrative head who would do the local organizing and take the 
financial risk etc. So after some planning, I invited them all into a 
mailing list and offered them to use the Bundeswehrdepot location I 
had used for Underground Conference 2002.«»
«»
Of course this move seemed a bit strange to some people - while I was 
running my own software company for a few years already, and therefore 
had lots of contacts with the commercial world, I was a radical fighter 
against commercialization inside the scene, who in the past had already 
attacked the M&S organizing team for various decisions done (allowing the 
teenie magazine "Bravo Screen Fun" to report from M&S, not fighting 
gamers at M&S enough, hiring an aggressive security team and all 
that). Still everyone from the former M&S team who didn't want to 
retire from the scene anyway decided to trust me and join the 
Breakpoint organizing team.«»
«»
As this is an often-asked question, I'll add this here: The reason why 
Breakpoint was moved to Bingen am Rhein was that I happen to live 
here, and did all the local organization work. It's quite impossible 
to do the main organization for a party whose location is 500kms away 
from your home.«»
«c1»«»
What do you think was the key to the success of the Breakpoint parties so  
far?«»
«c2»«»
The most important thing is that all main organizers are active 
sceners. A lot of the other big parties (and this includes M&S) have 
suffered from the main organizers losing contact with the scene, and 
therefore making wrong decisions on which routes to go. All members of 
the main organizing team are respected sceners. From the first day on, 
we also build upon synergy effects - we invited organizers from every 
other existing German demo party to join the team, adding heaps of 
experience. This hasn't changed until today - all major German demoparties 
are working closely together and helping each other, and once in a 
year the organizers of all of them together work for Breakpoint. Also 
we manage to keep our team fresh - each year we are seeking motivated 
young sceners and add them to the team.«»
«»
All this together makes the main difference to most other current and 
past big demoscene parties - nobody in our team does the work because 
of the "good old times" (which often results in organizers totally 
forgetting what TODAYS sceners needs are), we do it because we are 
supporting a scene we are directly a part of.«»
«c1»«»
You've also organized other parties, what do you think are the main  
difference 
between the Breakpoint party and the Underground Conference?«»
«c2»«»
The Underground Conference is something completely different. It was 
designed to be the most "hardcore" demoparty ever. It is illogical, 
chaotic and disorganized. All organizers are guaranteed to be drunk 
and stoned from the first hour on. The whole thing is kind of a 
survival camp for demo sceners with no real heating, no water etc, 
usually held at locations in forests near the end of the world. Everything is 
organized in a way that doesn't make sense, and that makes it a hell lot 
of fun. I'll give you an example: We have our own currency, the 
"rule". The exchange rate is: 0.50 Euros = 303 Rule. The money is 
stored on a chip card you get when entering the party, and everything 
on the party is paid for in rule. Also in additional to traditional 
party competitions, UC also features things like "180 BPM pan 
beating", "SID headbanging". No other party I've ever visited gave me 
such a "we are a family because together we've survived this"-kind of 
feeling. This of course only works because the party is small, and 
everyone is able to trust each other even in the most weird 
situations.«»
«»
Breakpoint, on the other hand, is meant as a mass-event for all 
sceners, even the "I want it warm and clean"-ones, beginners and all 
that. Also Breakpoint is connecting the world outside of the scene 
(press, commercial world). While Breakpoint is meant to be large, 
representative and friendly to everyone interested into the scene, UC 
is meant for hardcore sceners only.«»

«c4»Breakpoint 2005 - Aliens ate my demomaker«»
«c1»«»
The Breakpoint party, changed location from the Bundeswehrdepot to the
Rundsporthalle. What's the reason for the change of location,
and what do you see as the main advantages and disadvantages of this?«»
«c2»«»
The Bundeswehrdepot was originally chosen because it was a location 
that I already had my hands on from Underground Conference. For a 
"serious" party like Breakpoint it had lots of drawbacks - as the 
location was abandoned and unused for well over 15 years, everything 
was old and rusty. The water pipes were broken, so there was no way to 
get running water. The halls were originally used to store army trucks 
and didn't have any isolation. The only real great thing about the 
location was the freedom it gave us - the next town was 5kms away. We 
were able to do a huge bonfire, lots of outside action, and be 
incredibly loud.«»
«»
One of the main problems with the location was that it wasn't 
abandoned for no reason - the Country of Germany and the city of 
Bingen where fighting about it for several years already. While the 
German army wanted to sell the location or re-use it for something, 
the city of Bingen wanted to get the whole location removed and the 
area renatured - with the country paying the bill. As you need a 
permission from the city to change the kind of usage of an area (e.g. 
make a military area into something else), the city of Bingen used this 
power to reject any potential investor or buyer the army brought 
to them. For 2003, I managed to convince the city to give me an 
exception to use the location for Breakpoint.«»
«»
At the end of 2003, things got worse - now the city and the army 
started a lawsuit regarding the whole issue. The city council silently 
adopted a bill which said that the location was no longer allowed to be used 
for anything. Boy, was I surprised when in late 2003 my request for a 
permission to use the location for Breakpoint 2004 was rejected due to 
that bill. The future of Breakpoint was in limbo, and there wasn't 
enough time to find a new location. The following weeks were used to 
visit any political party in Bingen, sit together with the city major, 
sit together with the office of tourism and all kind of lobbies and 
"important" people. I even organized demo shows for the city council 
so they could see what this was all about.«»
«»
In the end, a few weeks before the party, the city council in a 
special session made a decision to allow me to use the location 
again. I had to sign a paper which said I would promise to 
never again ask for the location, though ;)«»
«»
While all this may sound like a nightmare (well, it was), it had a 
really great outcome: I made everyone in the city council aware of 
what we do, and these days everyone thinks it's a great thing that 
needs to be supported. I'm now getting all the support I could 
possibly imagine from the city and the political parties. I was 
offered the Rundsporthalle as a replacement location, and the Easter 
weekend got reserved to us "forever".«»
«»
Looking back, I now think with all them loving us, I would be able to 
convince them again to let us use the Bundeswehrdepot. But well, we've 
lost our interest.«»
«»
After Breakpoint 2004, we started a visitor survey asking about 
various aspects of the party, and what we should improve on. A lot of 
people requested improvements in areas that are impossible to improve 
at the Bundeswehrdepot. For example a lot of people asked for better 
heating. Well, now you need to know that at Breakpoint 2004, we 
invested over 7.000 Euros in heating equipment and heating oil! An 
unbelievable sum and by far the biggest chunk of our budget, but it 
still wasn't enough to get the un-insulated hall warm, while the 
freezing wind was blowing in through various holes in the walls.«»
«»
People also requested lots of other things we couldn't really do at 
the Bundeswehrdepot.«»
«»
In the end, there was only one thing about the Bundeswehrdepot 
everyone wanted to keep: The freedom regarding noise and outside 
action, and the large bonfire.«»
«»
So there was a tough decision for us to do - we knew that no "real" 
hall location would give us the freedom we had. You can't do a 5 
meters high bonfire in the middle of a city. But as the majority of 
our visitors had wishes we couldn't fulfil at the Bundeswehrdepot, 
there was no other choice left - we had to switch locations.«»
«»
Not having to spend an insane sum of money for heating also allows us 
to add heaps of new party features we couldn't afford at previous 
partys. There will be lots of special events and goodies.«»
«»
Ok, this was the short version of the story regarding the location 
change ;)«»
«c1»«»
It seems like a lot of experienced organizers with background 
from lots of various parties are behind the 
Breakpoint party. Are there any big changes in the staff from previous  
years?«»
«c2»«»
No, there aren't any big changes. Most importantly, all the highly 
respected sceners of the competition team are still with us. The only 
real change is that we are enlarging the whole organizing team with quite a few  
new talents to be able to bring more features to the party.«»
«c1»«»
Is organizing a party as big as the Breakpoint party very time consuming? 
How much time do you spend on this party?«»
«c2»«»
It sure is. I approximately spend 3 months of full working days doing 
the main organizing. 2004 was especially hard because I additionally 
had to do political lobbying to get the location. While a new location also  
means re-doing a lot of work, the Rundsporthalle is promising to give me much 
less headaches regarding unexpected problems than the Bundeswehrdepot.«»
«c1»«»
You're focusing very much on the fact that Breakpoint will be a demoscene 
party (not a LAN or copy party). What's the difference  
in atmosphere after your opinion? Are you 
afraid that the Breakpoint party with time also will turn 
into something like the Assembly party, the 
Gathering party and at the end like the Party?«»
«c2»«»
It's rather easy: I'm a demoscener, not a gamer. I work my ass off to 
support the scene I love and am part of. Why on earth should I invest 
all that sweat to support people I don't care about?«»
«»
Regarding the atmosphere: LAN-parties are usually "sterile", quiet, and have a 
VERY strict ruleset without any kind of freedom. Demoparties on the 
other hand are loud, colourful and full of creative freedom.«»
«»
Very personal opinion coming up:«»
«»
Breakpoint will never become a LAN-Party, and we'll never go the route 
The Gathering or The Party have taken. Many organizers of "big" parties 
do the work for ego reasons. This makes them want to make their party 
bigger and bigger, as they will become more famous, more press and 
sponsors will show up and all that. But well, the demoscene only has a 
limited size, so they invite all kind of non-sceners to make their 
party grow. And in the end, the result always is the same: They are 
losing their roots, and one day the sceners will be a minority, looked 
at as in a Zoo. I've sure got more than enough ego already, so I don't 
feel the urge to become famous by organizing a huge "computer party".«»
«»
By spending 3 months/year for organizing Breakpoint, I lose a hell lot 
of money I could make with my company. Financially, Breakpoint already 
is a gigantic loss for me, and I see no reason to increase that loss just 
to enable a few hundreds gamers or leechers to visit our party.«»
«c1»«»
Why don't you welcome gamers at the Breakpoint party?«»
«c2»«»
Counter-question: Why should we? Where's the benefit for the scene? I 
don't see any. The stuff I hear most often regarding this is:«»
«»
a) Allowing gamers at the party will give you a better budget for the 
sceners.«»
«»
Nonsense. The bigger a party gets, the more expensive it becomes per 
visitor, as you need to invest in all kinds of additional things 
required by law and less aspects can still be organized by volunteers. 
Just compare the entrance fees of the "other big parties" that invite 
gamers with Breakpoints - they are twice as high as ours.«»
«» 
b) Gamers might become interested in the scene by visiting a demo 
party as a gamer.«»
«»
While this might be true in some rare cases, at least inside Germany I 
haven't met a single scener that converted from being a gamer. And I 
know pretty much anyone. Gamers can still read about demoparties in 
gaming magazines or hear about it from friends or cracktros. If they 
really are interested in what we are doing, they'll show up even 
without being able to play games.«»
«»
c) Gamers are traditionally connected to the scene«»
«»
No, they are not. Game-DEVELOPERS are. Gamer-Modders are. Those 
are the absolute minorities at a typical LAN party, and they sure are 
welcome to visit Breakpoint. Actually we are working on improving 
Breakpoints connections to the game development scene as we clearly 
are interested in this target group.«»
«»
d) Gamers don't do any harm to me, I don't mind them showing up at a 
demoparty.«»
«»
Face it - a demoparty is not what a gamer wants. The demoparties that 
got "infected" with gamers are by no means respected inside the gaming 
scene, compared to the "real" LANs they are completely irrelevant. For 
example, "The Party" died with both the sceners and the gamers 
remembering it as a crappy party.«»
«» 
This is no surprise, a typical LAN-party visitor has totally different 
expectations about what a party should offer than a demoscener. So as a 
party organizer inviting gamers, you now have to do a compromise to make 
both groups happy. In the long run the gamers WILL change your
demoparty.«»
«»
We don't want compromises. We want the best possible party experience 
for our fellow demoscene visitors. That's the sole reason for our 
policy.«»
«c1»«»
One of the most important things for sceners being at parties (apart from 
socializing with sceners) is of course the competitions. The scene is 
about working within limitations, showing your skills, so why 
has it been allowed to use a hxxx lot of 
ram and make a huge executable in the past Amiga demo and 
intro competitions? Isn't this the opposite 
of working with limitations but instead giving a helping hand 
to those that are not that skilled 
(for example those that can't optimize their sources and use lots of  
animations etc.)?«»
«c2»«»
The rules of all competitions are based on the feedback given by the 
scene. While we get lots of feedback from the PC and C64 scene, the 
Amiga scene is far too quiet. Up until now there have been zero posts 
in our party forums or mailings to our competition hotline regarding 
this topic. Go figure.«»
«c1»«»
Isn't it a bit unfair to  join the  classic Amiga and the 
PPC productions in one compo? Isn't  that  
almost like joining the Amiga and C64 compos? Do you have 
any plans to separate the classic and PPC 
productions in the future, or are there simply too few Amiga contributions  
to do this?«»
«c2»«»
There are more platforms than the Amiga. It has been discussed several 
times if we should completely scrap platform-based competitions and 
instead do unified competitions based on hardware power, e.g. Amiga 
PPC, Mac, PC Windows, PC Linux, XBOX in one competition, the less 
powerful hardware in another one etc. Doing this would be a major 
change, and we won't do it without getting tons of feedback from the 
community.«»
«»
Regarding the "unfair"-stuff: No, it's not. Entries are presented with 
clear information about what platform they run under. Sceners are able 
to judge how big a achievement is based on this information. And if 
you think that many (especially PC-)sceners are unable to do that, I 
have to reply: Well, no matter if it's classic Amiga or PPC, these 
guys would say "but demos on my PC look better!" anyway.«»
«» 
Have a look at the console/"real wild" competition. This is a proof 
that sceners ARE able to judge based on the platform information given 
to them. We've seen Gameboy entries beating XBOX entries and the other 
way round.«»
«»
As you already have more or less guessed, separating the PPC and Amiga classic 
compos would result in the quick death of competitions for these 
platforms due to lack of entries.«»
«»
Honestly, this is not the time for the Amiga scene to scatter, this is 
the time for it to unite.«»
«c1»«»
Are there for instance any plans of having a 4channel music competition 
or other compos with special limitations?«»
«c2»«»
Not for the 4 Channel competition. Past has shown that 4-channel tracks 
are able to win the multichannel competition, so this isn't needed. 
There will be a new competition with limitations, but I won't disclose 
this for now.«»
«»
Also keep in mind that all competition decisions are done by the 
respective competition organizers, so nothing I say about this is 
binding.«»
«c1»«»
How do you practise the "pre-selection" for compos? Who is pre-selecting 
what will be shown in the competitions (who will be in the jury)? 
Pre-selection has often been criticized at parties, so is it really needed 
these days? Are there still so many contributions in the compos?«»
«c2»«»
The jury consists of the competition organizers of the respective 
competition. Pre-Selection is only done for the competitions where 
there are too many entries to show/play (music competition), or 
usually a lot of crap is released (wild competition). All this is by the 
way described in detail on our website, and for each competition 
the "jury" is listed.«»
«c1»«»
The general rule is that you have to be present to submit 
anything to the party, but the demos are the 
exception. Will people that actually win something in the 
demo-compo get their prizes if they’re not 
present?«»
«c2»«»
No, they usually won't. Competition prizes are paid from the visitors 
entrance fees. If you didn't contribute to that fund, you have no 
moral right to receive money from it, right?«»
«»
There are a few exceptions in cases of competition prizes provided by 
our sponsors, though.«»
«»
Up until now this hasn't been an issue at all, because everyone wants 
to be at Breakpoint anyway ;)«»
«c1»«»
Will you give the readers of EuroChart any insights about what will happen 
at the Breakpoint party? Live-shows? Special happenings? Competitions? 
And what has the Breakpoint party to offer which other parties lack?«»
«c2»«»
Well, you just got the most detailed insight given at what's going on 
at Breakpoint ever, so don't ask for more ;)«»
«»
No, really, all the new features not yet announced on the website are 
secret for a reason - most of them depend on things we still need to 
organize and won't announce before they are 100% secured.«»
«c1»«»
Please tell your opinion about the future of the Breakpoint party:«»
