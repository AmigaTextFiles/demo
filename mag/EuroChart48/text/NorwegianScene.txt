NORWEGIAN SCENE-REPORT«»

By Zerox of Gods«»
«c2»«as»«»
In  the  last  issues of the EuroChart I've totally updated my scene-report
and thereby removed all the dead and inactive groups.  This means I'll only
focus  on  the somewhat active groups who manage to come up with an Amiga
production  now  and  then.   I'll also skip groups with members who aren't
able  to  come up with productions on their own, or making mainly non-Amiga
productions.  The result should be that this scene-report cover the more or
less  active  forces of the smaller and smaller Norwegian scene!  So if you
miss  your  group  among  the  teams  mentioned  in this report, start
getting active on Amiga!«»

APATHY«»
«c2»«»
-  This  group  has  produced lots of productions from intros and demos, to
musicdisks  and  packs,  but not the latest years.  The latest release from
Apathy  was  at  the Kindergarden party 2003, where they released the intro
Haakan  in  coop  with  UpRough.   At  the  Solskogen party 2004 they begun
working  on  another  small intro, but it didn't get finished and has never
been released.«»

CONTRAZ«»
«c2»«»
-  Contraz has been one of the best Norwegian teams the "latest" years with
many  releases;  both  intros  and  demos.   I  first  noticed  them at the
Gathering'95,  and  afterwards they've improved quite much.  The group is a
result  of two crews joining forces; NSS and Black Spiders, and some of the
members  have  been sceners for a real long time.  The latest Amiga release
I've  seen was the demo Micromonster from the Gathering 2003.  Contraz also
organized  the  Kindergarden party 2004.  It's not very likely they'll come
up  with  many  more Amiga productions.  You should expect some releases on
other platforms instead.«»

-  They  have  been  in  Norway  since around 1994 I think.  The last Amiga
production  I  saw from them was the intro released at the Breakpoint 2005.
It was done in cooperation with the Danish member Curt Cool.«»

«c4»EPHIDRENA«»
«c2»«»
-  This  is  the  leading  Norwegian team these days after the departure of
Andromeda,  perhaps  in  some  competition  with groups like Spaceballs and
Contraz.  They are also one of the leading international groups these days.
Ephidrena  got  founded  in  mid 1995, and have been very active the latest
years with lots of demos and intros.  Their big breakthrough got to be with
the  winning  Concrete demo at the Party 9, but of course they've also made
some  great  intros  that  have  done  good at various parties. 
Their  latest  production  however seems to be an intro called Gin & Tronic
shown  at  the  Kindergarden  2005 in November.  I can't find it on the net
though.«»

«c4»GODS«»
«c2»«»
- This group got founded in 1994 and was very active the next 3 years.  The
latest  years  they have not been very active on Amiga.  The Norwegian side
of  this  crew  was  probably  at its best around 1995.  They were behind a
certain diskmag called D.I.S.C.  and some slideshows.  The demos and intros
were  mainly  done  by  the French coders in cooperation with the Norwegian
graphicians.   In  any  case,  DISC  14  in  coop with IRIS released at the
Kindergarden  party  2003,  was their latest release so far, in addition to
the small intro released for the EuroChart issue 47 in January 2004.«»

«c4»SCENIC«»
«c2»«»
-  This  is  a  group founded by Fusko and Pix a few years ago.  It's quite
special  as  it  only  consists  of  graphicians.   The  group  will mainly
cooperate  with  other groups and make the entire design in productions for
them.   Some  years ago Scenic was working on slideshows, both on Amiga and
PC.  They are still not released.«»

«c4»SPACEBALLS«»
«c2»«»
- This is a legendary crew which got founded back in 1989.  It has had lots
of  famous  members,  like Dark Helmet, Lone Starr, Lord Helmet, Vinnie and
Major  Asshole  to  mention  a  few.   It has also released lots of quality
productions during this period, most famous are probably Wayfarer, State Of
The  Art,  RAW  and  9  Fingers.  The latest years they have been even more
active with Slummy as the coding-force behind all productions.  They've won
the  demo  compo  at  the  Gathering  Party  an amazing 4 times.  The latest
releases  so  far  are probably Whatever rocks your Boat, Hog and Shameless
that  all  got  out  in  2004.   In  addition  to this, Spaceballs made a
contribution  called  Ballehard intro at the Gathering 2005.  However, that
production  didn't run very well in the compo, and I can't find the release
anywhere. Slummy  is  busy  working these days, so his activity level has
dropped. That  didn't  stop  him  from  making  some  productions for the
Kindergarden party 2005 this november.«»

«c4»SPECTER«»
«c2»«»
-  This  is  a  group  consisting only of norwegian members.  However, most
members  are  double or triple-members and some are using different handles
in  this  group.   Nevertheless,  Lost  Puppy  4  and  Bubble are among the
releases  under  the  Specter  label.   More  releases  are expected in the
future.«»

«c4»SQUIRRELZ«»
«c2»«»
- This is a very special team.  In addition to being something as rare as a
"new"  group  in  the  Norwegian  scene,  it  also  contains  only females.
However,  the  only  Amiga  productions  I've  seen  from them so far were
Rabb-It  and  Spinner.   But those were obviously not done by them, hehe...
At  the  Trsac 3 party they released the wilddemo The Obstacle Test, and at
the  Kindergarden  party  2003  they  released  another contribution in the
wildcompo.  Leia is also a member of various other groups.«»

- According to my knowledge the only  Norwegian member of this group is now
Rumrunner.   In any case, he has released several issues of the mag Saxonia
and  Versus  (in coop with Nukleus), and also released the 4k-intro Bobflow
at the Jamaicademo. We're now waiting for Saxonia issue 4 to be released
early 2006, but before that a new demo is on its way.«»
