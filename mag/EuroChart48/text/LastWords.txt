And so it is over - at least for this time. You have come to the end, and 
so have we. It is a very somber yet enourmously relieving experience 
standing here at long last, having finished the massive year-long work 
that was involved. We hope that you, standing here with us, have also 
enjoyed the Eurochart issue 48.«»

While promises are a difficult thing to get right - they often end up 
unfulfilled or even broken - we will promise you to bring out the next 
Eurochart much faster than this one. For the 48th issue of the Eurochart, 
we really had to chew over a lot, more than any diskmag team has ever 
chewed over we think. Now, we know we succeeded in bringing you this 
issue, but we also know that issue 49 will be far, far easier to get 
out. We don't need to get new diskmag engines to run on a lot of 
platforms, we don't need a new Eurochart database, we don't need to 
set up quite as much text manually anymore, heck we don't even need 
new gfx if you don't supply it - we just need new votes, new articles, 
and new music for the next issue.«»

As to a more concrete estimate of when we will see the next Eurochart, 
we'd say that when the weather turns warm and sunny you should get 
ready for the EC again. After Breakpoint we will start working on the 
next issue, you will send in your support and then, happening somewhere 
around the sunny months, you will see the new issue.«»

Writing this makes me personally think 'oh no, do I have to start
working on that )!=!¤( chartmag again in just 2-3 months time?', but I 
hope some intensive care and psychological support will make me ready 
for that task once more. For now, the entire EC staff leaves you 
standing here, looking at the sunset together with us and hopefully 
motivated for scenish work.«»
«»
We will all meet at the Breakpoint party and do the releases that are 
the lifeblood of our scene. Until then, take care, all of you.«»
