INTRODUCTION«»
«c1»«»
As  a  short  introduction,  please  tell  the  readers  a  few words about
yourself,  which  computer  scene  you're  a  part  of and what you want to
achieve in the scene.«»
«c2»«»
Hmmm... what to say? Been a member of Ephidrena since the start, 
having music and composing as my main function in the group. Have done 
tracks for several demos and intro during the years. Mostly for Ephidrena 
on Amiga, but I've appeared on some prods by Contraz, Kewlers, and 
Ym Rockers as well.. I concentrated on Amiga productions only 
until 2002 when I did music for an Atari productions as well. This year
I also contributed on my first pc release, although I've worked with 
several softsynts on Windows the last four years.«»
«c1»«»
When did you enter the scene and how did you first get attracted to it?«»
«c2»«»
My first introduction to the scene was in 1990. I had just purchased my 
first  computer, an Amiga 500 and were copying some games from a friend.
When finished with the X-Copy session, I was introduced to some crackintros, 
that lasted a lot longer than the ones included on the games. I was amazed when 
told that they where made by people, not so very much older than myself. 
They were called demos, and I decided to start collecting them.«»
«»
When it comes to music, I always liked to listen to music from various 
games I played on the C64, Msx, Sega Master system, etc. So when I was 
introduced to Soundtracker, my path was clear :) Although I got my first 
copy of it in 1991, I played a lot of games, and it wasn't until '93 I 
stopped laming and concentrated on composing for real.«»
«c1»«»
What do you find so fascinating with the scene?«»
«c2»«»
Hmmm.... In the beginning I was stunned by the fact that there where guys 
sitting at home and producing demos that were much more technically advanced 
than many of the commercial games released at the same time. But in those 
days, we didn't have such a big gaming industry. Nowadays we have companies 
with several hundreds of employees working with the same project. But 
since the demoscene has concentrated on making productions mostly for the 
scene itself, and not for the man on the street, I would say that the gap 
between the game industry and the demoscene is much bigger now than 
ten-fifteen years ago.«»
«»
Nowadays, I'm mostly fascinated by the fact that despite all the 
"scene is dead"  statements slagged around on threads, demoscrollers, 
diskmags, etc....demoevents are  held, demos are released and there are 
more than a thousand demosceners still around, making productions for their 
platform(s). Even today there are newcomers joining, and even some retired
old-timers are making a comeback or two. The scene is alive, and we are still
making wonders!«»
«c4»«»
GROUPS«»
«c1»«»
Please tell us a few words about Ephidrena.«»
«c2»«»
A lot has happened since the start in 95, and writing about it here and 
now would take an awful lot of time, so I would recommend everybody 
interested to check out our homepage at «c3»www.ephidrena.net.«»
«c2»«»
Anyway, Ephidrena has existed as a group for ten years now, and we 
celebrated our anniversary  by having an internal party this summer. During 
the years we have been keeping the group active, I'm glad we have been able to 
keep the contact between everybody in the group,  despite the fact that 
not all of us are active any more. That is perhaps a reason in itself to 
celebrate?«»
«c1»«»
What's your all-time favourite group? And why?«»
«c2»«»
I'm afraid there are to many demogroups who have released a lot of 
quality production so I cannot manage to select any specific. Luxury 
problem perhaps? :) The Amiga scene is blessed with it.«»
«c1»«»
What's the next release we'll see from your group?«»
«c2»«»
A finished version of Loaderrors Gin & Tronic 4k from KG this year. 
(If it's not already been released.)«»
«c4»«»
DEMOS«»
«c1»«»
Tell us about your favourite production.«»
«c2»«»
Again a luxury problem strikes me.... But since this is about Amiga prods, 
I would like to select Planet Potion. It's as close as you can get when it 
comes to perfection. At MS2002, the audience went wild when it hit the 
bigscreen.  And only 64k big....Magic!«»
«c1»«»
Do you think it's ok to include animations in demos/intros?«»
«c2»«»
Of course it is! Demos have always been about faking your skills :) 
Honestly, I don't see any problem using it. Combining it with coded effects
shines it up more than you will ever imagine. What would Substral, 
Concrete and J' have been without the small design anims?«»
«c1»«»
What do you think about nowadays demos compared to the demos you saw
when you first entered the scene?
«c2»«»
When I started to collect demos, Amiga was the state of the art, and 
the ultimate platform to make demos on. Nowadays it's a slow old dinosaur
compared to modern IBM-PC compatible computers. Such a change has 
influenced the newschool demos heavily. Old Amiga demos displayed world
records, while modern Amiga demos try to push lemonade out of a stone. 
I think each period has its glory, and its goldies.«»
«c4»«»
THE SCENE«»
«c1»«»
Do you remember the first demo you saw and mag you read?«»
«c2»«»
I do not recall my first demo, but my first mag was Raw#4.«»
«c1»«»
What do you think are the good and bad sides of the scene?«»
«c2»«»
The good side of today's demoscene is that people of all platforms
respect each other. There are no childish wars that spoil the 
atmosphere at demoparties, which where a frequent plague at earlier 
parties.«»
«»
When it comes to the bad side, I think we have a bit too low a recruiting 
level in regards to newcombers. And I have no magic receipt how to make the 
demoscene more attractive for yongsters. Maybe because the way today's kids are 
introduced to the modern PC as a simple user, makes the way into 
3d/code/gfx/music more tricky?«»
«c1»«»
Do you have any special scene memory you want to share with the readers?«»
«c2»«»
My best scene memory is from TP99, when we won the democompo. I was so 
sure about TBL winning the compo and was taken completely by surprise 
when we where announced as winners.  When I rose up from the chair, 
Loaderror sitting next to me grabbed me and we ended up rolling around on the 
floor while the audience was laughing. The rest of the party was great,
and we had a great afterparty at the ferry back to Norway!«»
«c4»«»
MUSIC«»
«c1»«»
When did you decide to start composing and what was your very first module?
By  the  way has  it been released?  Which was the first module used in a
production?«»
«c2»«»
I focused on music making for real in 1993 and wrote only mod music until
1996, when I did my first XM tune. In 1998 I discovered Digibooster and 
did a lot of DBM music. Four years later I began working with softsynths
and most of my work nowadays is done with Reason. I also have done some
AHX tunes earlier, and after I bought an Atari Falcon in 2002 I've done
some tunes on it as well in various formats.«»
«»
My very first mod file was made in 91. Just some crap I don't have
any more, but I still remember how horrible it sounded.«»
«»
The first production from Ephidrena also included a tune made by 
me. A horrible release, never spread. (And thank God for that!)«»
«c1»«»
What's is your favourite own made module?«»
«c2»«»
Of those that are released, I prefer "Feel" which was used in the 
endpart of our demo Flux from TG99. The tune was originally much shorter
and made for a 64k intro which was never released. Some days before going
to TG, we started to get closer to the finish of the demo and we needed an 
endpart tune. I suggested using it, and we agreed to 
include the tune. So I started to make more parts and extended its length.
Today I'm very satisfied with the final result.«»
«c1»«»
What's your favourite module made by others?«»
«c2»«»
For some reason I'm still very impressed with the tune "Slow Motion" by 
Axel/Brainstorm. You can start listening to it again and again without 
getting tired of it. Perhaps the best diskmag tune ever? I'll vote for
it for sure!«»
«c1»«»
How  do  you  start  when composing a new tune?  Do you start experimenting
with  any  instrument, or do you first get a vague melody in your head which
you  want  to  realize?   And  do  you use this main melody to bring other
instruments and background themes in afterwards?«»
«c2»«»
I write music after what kind of sounds I produce in the softsynths I 
work  with. Actually, having the option of producing your own sounds and 
write your melodies in the same program are one of the main reasons  for 
making most of my music in softsynths nowadays. When tracking earlier, I was 
always in need of a sample CD for getting soundclips to use, and too many 
times I had to rip samples from other sceners to get the most out of my 
work. A shame really.«»
«c1»«»
You won both the 32k exe music compo with the tune "Vrien" and the high
quality  music compo with the song "Et stykke håndverk" at the Kindergarden
party  2005  held  last  month.   How long did it take to finish those
tunes?  And how long do you usually spend on making a normal module?«»
«c2»«»
Its hard to say how long I use on a tune. Sometimes it's done within 
days, other times even more than a month. It depends a bit on what I 
want to obtain. If I start with a rather complex project, there is always a 
risk of spending more than a month before I reach my goal. Simpler projects 
usually take much less time. But it's also a question of how much time I
can spend on it if I have a deadline to follow.«»
«»
"Vrien" was developed in MaxYMizer on my Falcon, and I spent about two 
weeks on it. I did an ordinary tune with three Ym channels only first, and 
when a new version of maxYMizer got released right after I finished the tune,
I added DMA channels to it and put all the digidums in those two channels,
leaving the sinewaves and buzzes alone in the ym channels. The Dma version I 
released got a much more powerful base drum and clearer replay on the 
hihat, and I think it was those final details that made it a winner.«»
«»
"Et stykke håndtverk" also took about two-three weeks to do. Most work 
was done in Reason on my PC, while some small after touches where done with
Soundforge. When starting it I had the main melody in my head and some 
soundpatches ready to use from previous work, so it wasn't really that hard 
to finish it in time.«»
«c1»«»
Are  there  any other composers who influence your music, and in that case
which ones?  Who are your favourite module/chiptune composers?«»
«c2»«»
In the late nineties I listened a lot to musicians like: Revisq, 
Muffler, Bay Tremore, Whiskas, Heatbeat, Dizzy, and Groo. Nowadays, most 
music in the scene is made in various formats on various platforms, so the
rules have changed a bit. Among sceners who works with streamed music, 
Ponas, Syntheesi, and Little Bitchard are among my favourites. On the C64 I
prefer Ne7 and  Aleksi Eeben, while STU, Gwem and Tao are my favourites on 
the Ym 2149 chip on Atari.«»
«c1»«»
What kind of style of music do you enjoy the most of making?«»
«c2»«»
My own style :)«»
«c1»«»
When making  music for an Ephidrena production, how does the cooperation
usually  start?   Does  the  coder ask for a certain type of music, or do you
have  an idea and make a module and then ask the coder to make some fitting
effects?  Do you spend much time adjusting the music to a demo for
example?«»
«c2»«»
Our demos mostly start around a tune or parts of a tune, but it's always
a long process from the day we start working with something until it's 
finally done. Adjusting the music to the code/gfx and vice versa
takes an awful lot of time, and sometimes the whole demoproject comes to a halt 
because of design issues. But at the same time, it is vitally necessary
to have consistency in how the 2d/3d/music and code work together, or 
you easily end up with a boring and/or chaotic effect flyby.«»
«c1»«»
If  you  forget  about  your  computer for a minute and grab a CD from your
collection,  which  one would it be and why?  Which 'real' music styles and
composers do you enjoy the most?«»
«c2»«»
Right now I have a CD by Plaid called "parts in the post" on my table. A 
fantastic compilation of remixes Plaid have done of other artists.
If I should select any favourite musicians, I would say Autechre, but 
artists like, Aphex Twin, Plaid, Squarepusher, Biosphere, Pluxus, Orbital,
The Orb, FSOL, Crystal Method, and Chris Clark are also among those I
respect highly.«»
«c1»«»
Many  scene  musicians have played other instruments before they joined the
scene, have you?«»
«c2»«»
I've never been interested in playing with any music instrument, since
you have to spend so much time learning to master your instrument 
before you are able to try making anything of your own on it. An instrument
is just a voice. With music software you can make a complete band or an 
orchestra of your own. And that's the way I like to do it.«»
«c1»«»
Do you have any musicprojects going on outside the scene at the moment?«»
«c2»«»
During a year I produce about ten tunes in various formats. Most
of them are quite long tunes which last about 6-9 minutes and don't
really fit a demoscene production, but some of them can be used if a 
fitting demoproject shows up. I like working with electronic music and 
since I have the option of taking time out for making music, I see no reason
to stop, unless I got entirely fed up or something.«»
«c1»«»
What  do  you  think  about the older scene musicians like; Chromag, Dizzy,
Dreamer,  Heatbeat,  Jogeir,  Moby, Virgill, Xtd and others compared to the
quality of nowadays scene musicians?«»
«c2»«»
Nowadays musicians have a totally different scene to compete in since 
there are so much more music software to choose from when working with
demomusic. In the old days Amiga 500 ruled, and Protracker was the 
ultimate demomusic program. As a musician you where quite limited to those 
four channels, and had to tweak a lot to get anything interesting out of 
it. Modern softsynths makes a lot of operations very easy but at the same 
time you have a lot of pitfalls you must avoid in order not to mess everything 
up. So it's hard to compare.«»
«c1»«»
What  was  the  last  good  demo you saw?  What was the last music-disk you
heard and the last diskmag you read?«»
«c2»«»
I watch demos quite often on all platforms, so there are several good
releases through a year. Last Amigademo I checked out was "Treble" by Rno, 
really nice work for the Amiga 500. Last music disk I heard was 
"Hacks for Tracks" by Loaderror/Ephidrena, Last diskmag I checked out
was the latest issue of Jurassic Pack.«»
«c1»«»  
Describe the future of the Amiga;«»
«»
OPTIMISTIC: «c2»Amiga OS 4.0 makes it comeback, and establishes itself as an 
            alternative.«»
«c1»«»
REALISTIC:  «c2»Amiga OS 4.0 hits the market, but only gets attention amongst 
            hardcore users and earlier users of Amiga. It will struggle to 
            survive, but will make it in the end.«»
«c1»«»
PESIMISTIC: «c2»People reject OS4.0, stating that "It's not what Amiga is all 
            about", buy themselves a new PC with Windows bundled, and
            complain about how much better everything was before.«»
«c4»«»  
REAL LIFE«»
«c1»«»
What's your occupation?«»
«c2»«»
Nothing special, I work in a Scandinavian shop selling computer hardware
and software. My function at the store is to have a complete overview over
the storage and stock.«»
«c1»«»
Do  you  have any hobbies other than scening?  I've heard some rumours that
you're  very  interested  in  the Norwegian language and spelling?  Can you
tell our readers more about that?«»
«c2»«»
Hehe, it's true I sometimes start to analyse Norwegian dialects to discover
parts of our past history. Dialects doesn't only tell where you are from, it
also says a lot about your personality, your local community, etc.....«»
«»
Interests outside the scene.... Hmmmm.... I have a passion for Formula One 
racing and watch most of the races when they are racing on the TV. I also 
follow my favourite football team from my town who play in Norwegian
2.div.«»
«»
Then of course, Movies, especially Scifi movies and series, are of great
interest to me. I simply can't get enough of the new "Battlestar
Galactica".«»
«c4»«»
THE END«»
«c1»«»
Do you picture yourself in the scene 10 years from now? ;)«»
«c2»«»
No idea... if it's still attractive and interesting to attend, I'll
probably be a part of it if I have time.«»
«c1»«»
What are your future plans in life?«»
«c2»«»
People who know me find me quite pessimistic, so I think I'll refrain 
from answering that question. :)«»
«c1»«»
At last, ask yourself a question and answer it.«»
«c2»«»
Will these be my last words?«»
