Sometimes sceners act like a wolf pack.  Hunting for negativity and a chance
of  slaughtering  the work of others.  No doubt it's very easy to make
certain  aggressive and mocking articles nowadays, as the quality level has
dropped  quite  much  in  for  example the mag world all in all considered.
Most  people  think  their  own work is pretty good though, it's always the
others  that lack the capability to come up with amazing releases.  Luckily
many  sceners  are  familiar  with  irony  also.  Nevertheless, not much is
stopping me from making this easy article.  So here are some statements from
various sceners.  Some are just too good to exclude.«»

"Fuckyanica  10:   A  rumour  told me fake voting has penetrated the party.
Maybe  true,  especially when looking about the rank my own picture got and
most  of  the  other pictures were pure crap.  But, that's life, and I'm not
known to be a bad loser.".«»
