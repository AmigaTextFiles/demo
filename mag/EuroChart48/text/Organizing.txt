We are running on the razor's edge of
20 years of demo  scening, and are about 
to enter a new dimension with  our two 
new systems,  AmigaOne and Pegasos.«»
«»
In the past years  we have experienced other
technlogy changes.«» 
From OCS to ECS.«»
From ECS to AGA.«» 
From AGA to a sort  of  implementation 
of  classic  Amiga  equipped with PPC, 
Gfx  cards  and  all sort of hacks and 
mods.«»
«»
Now it's time for another trip. 
Basically  it's  the  same thing  that
happened    last   times  ,  there are no    real 
differences, except for one: the  Scene  is
not longer as big as it was before.«»
«»
New talents are needed.«»

«c4»THE KEY ROLE«»
«»«c2»
The Leader or the Organizer! 
Of extreme importance , vital  to  the 
resolution of this problem,  it  plays 
an important role in the New Scene. 
He is the  key  to  starting up  the  new 
engine.«»
«»
«c4»TALENT SCOUT«»
«»«c2»
The leader must be someone able to 
discover and recruit talented persons. 
Not only inside  the  scene  but  more 
so OUTSIDE  the  scene even if 
this means looking for a  needle  in a 
haystack.«»
«»
«»
«c4»CONVERTER«»
«»«c2»
A leader must burn for  the  purpose 
of promoting a cause , being  able  to 
enlighten the spirits of  people. Or better, 
why not, to move them from the  old systems 
to the new one.  He must  be  active  and 
reactive, a sort of example to follow.«»
«»
«c4»INNOVATIVE«»
«»«c2»
Innovation and originality is the key. 
the idea is to introduce  new  ideas , 
remember  that  The  Scene  or  better 
The   Amiga   Demo  Scene  is not very
well  known outside of itself.«»
«»
Potential  talents are  a  bit 
afraid  and   fearful    in 
venturing into new and unknown  places 
or activities.  Just imagine how  many
potential sceners are  out  there.
Remember that you were one of them!«»
«»
So, one idea among others could be to
publish adverts in non scenish Amiga 
paper magazine, or on websites. 
Just some lines  inviting  people  to 
join up with your crew.«»
«»
It is a long time since we lost the 
culture of making jointros, or maybe it is
too hard to put 2 effects and a couple of
logos together?«» 
«»
«c4»CLASSIC's«»
«»«c2»
The leader must also try to increase
knowledge inside  his  crew,  keep it 
alive,  give  them goals to achieve,
the crew must feel deeply  united  and 
into business.«»
«»
The same thing must be done outside 
the crew, he must  be  a  channel of 
communication between  his  crew  and 
the rest of the scene.
News must be sent to magazines, people
need to know whether your crew is alive, whether
you need more  members, or  whether  you  are
working on something. It   will   keep the 
competition going.«»
«»
If a coder, a musician or a graphician
spends hours and hours  working  on  a 
project,  an  organizer is supposed to 
do the same.«»
«»
Well that sounds great, but actions 
speak louder than words.«»
