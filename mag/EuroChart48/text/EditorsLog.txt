Work begins on the next EC issue. We have got the go ahead to port the diskmag engine Panorama2 to the platforms we want it ported to. Ransom begins work on this. I lean back and plan the next issue, but do approximately nothing except asking a few people for support and mostly bugging Dr. Doom to finish the gfx. All of this will (unsurprisingly) take one
year.«»

Curt Cool hands in his module support for the Eurochart around here, and gets credit for being the first external

Zerox delivers his research about all productions released since 2002, and Hexagon starts on a design for our new site
(www.eurochart.dk).«»

March to May:«»
«c2»«»
Hexagon and myself start working on the massive database that is to be hosted at the new Eurochart site, as well as on the online voting system. Kempy jumps in and helps with adding things to the database. Many hours each day are spent, but in late March, the site is deemed functional enough and goes live. Support is overwhelming in regards to online voting, and within a few days, more than 100 votes have been gathered. The site continues to be fixed and updated, but the main work finishes in May. I take June off from EC work, and go on a vacation with my girlfriend to the Czech Republic, where there's thankfully no mention of any Eurochart
whatsoever.«»
«»
I also got a very nice tune from Nutman for the mag during this period.«»

9th - 16th July 2005:«»
«c2»«»
In a rented summercottage, during a week long IRIS meeting, Ransom finishes most of his work not with a scream, but rather with a (very tired) sigh. However, the Panorama2 engine now runs on Linux, Linux PPC and classic Amiga (though you would be a sadomasochist to want to try this). Sound is lacking, as is conversion to AOS4, Windows and MOS. Realizing that a massive work load is looming for me now, I slowly begin to get ready for the coming months, and manage to do my first few articles
here.«»
«»
Dr. Doom amazingly finishes his titlepicture for the mag, FINALLY, and now 'only' the panels are left to do for
him.«»
«»
Also, after some discussion as to the very dim possibility of optimizing the Panorama2 engine enough to be workable on 68k+AGA, it is decided to use one of our other diskmag engines, the one also used for
D.I.S.C.«»
«c4»«»
17th July - 9th August:«»
«c2»«»
I start the real call for support, setting the deadline at the 10th of August and start really bugging Dr. Doom for panels now, afraid that it would otherwise take another year. I don't dare to think about cliparts at this
stage.«»
«»
I write a few articles, but mostly spend my EC time trying to coerce people into supporting the magpart. This results in one, ONE (!!) article being sent to me before the
deadline.«»
«c4»«»
10th - 12th August:«»
«c2»«»
Zerox of Gods and Adonis visit me for a workmeeting centered on the Eurochart and the Kubika online mag (www.kubika.dk). Not taking a clue from the massive article silence, I write out lots of emails to make people support us. I also finish some articles, but not anywhere near as many as Zerox, who explodes in a frenzy of activity and ends up handing in around 13
articles.«»
«»
KAM_ sends in his music support for the EC, and so does Myx of Dream
Merchants.«»
«»
Kubika is also almost finished at this meeting, and appears with its first issue some days
later.«»

Time flies, and I do other stuff than the EC, trying to earn a living by participating in dubious pyramid schemes. Pretty clever, if I do have to say so
myself.«»

Came up with the idea of writing an editors log today. In totally unrelated news, I also managed to write my very own
filler.«»
«»
Spent 9 hours grammar checking the articles. Especially this part of being an editor is very enjoyable and makes it all worthwhile. Yes indeed.. Managed to finish roughly half of the work in this
field.«»
«c4»«»
19th August:«»
«c2»«»
3 hours spent grammarchecking, guess it will only take one more day of focused work
now.«»
«c4»«»
22th August:«»
«c2»«»
Another 5 hours have gone by grammarchecking. Am I slow or is this just incredibly timeconsuming? Anyway, now 503kb of text has been fixed, and that should be roughly 2/3 of the articles that we will feature. So all in all, we will have some kb's worth of articles, though the 1mb mark (the record held by D.I.S.C., at least in newer, non-Grapevine times) is still far
off.«»

24th August:«»
«c2»«»
Checked out the Panorama engine a bit, and wrote one article. If I just had to write articles and nothing else, life would be heaven. Spent 2 hours on the EC today I think, as I also wrote some rather long EC related mails. Some of them containing thinly veiled threats and shouts for
support.«»
«c4»«»
25th August:«»
«c2»«»
One more article written. Ok, slow progress, but still progress.«»
«c4»«»
26th August:«»
«c2»«»
And another article is finished. I'm a bit miffed that I can't put any more time into this these days, but other projects and real life concerns make this a bad week for the EC. Better luck next week I
guess.«»

Started learning how the Panorama2 engine works for real today, in order to do some layout. Got the article main menu up and running, but have no idea how the chart part is going to look yet. After around 8 hours of experimenting and figuring things out on my own, I guess I am ready to do some layouting. Too bad that I can't do any layout involving cliparts before the panels are ready, because I won't know how much space there will be for the clipart. As the panels have taken more than a year in arriving now, this vexes me a great deal. Oh well, I will have to dish out some treats, and focus on something else until getting those
panels.«»

1st September:«»
«c2»«»
Got our new 3D graphicians, SOL and Ismena working on 3D for our PPC EC intro, according to a simple design from me. If I could just find someone to do a 68k version too, it would be more or less perfect. Also, I need to find out who can do fitting music for this.«»

28th November:«»
«c2»«»
Ahehm.. A «c3»'minor' «c2»break in regards to the EuroChart, as I had finished doing everything I possibly could months ago. I needed the panels before I could continue my work. These have now arrived, FINALLY! Also, I got panels for the AGA version of the EC two weeks ago from Darklight, meaning I could have started working on the EC back then. However, I was indeed busy myself these last months, and could not have handled another full-time project. Now Hexagon and myself finished work on our online investment portal which is going to make us obscenely rich however, and thus I can dedicate myself more or less fully to finishing the
EC.«»
«»
Spent some time integrating the graphics into the Panorama2 engine, threatening people to support via email, re-familizarizing myself with the Panorama2 engine and grammar checking the articles I had gotten since the last batch to be checked. All in all I probably spent around 7 hours on the EC
today.«»
«c4»«»
29th November:«»
«c2»«»
7 hours spent today on learning PhotoShop, tweaking the graphics, deciding on a layout, sending out emails, brainstorming, writing a bit, finalizing a todo list for the people involved and so on. A 'light' day, in that there was a lot of different stuff to do, and a lot of thinking that had to be done. The 'todo' list is one ugly monster, but at least now it is set up and can get taken out one item at a time. Of course I had to get sick though, and my concentration is not the best right now. Getting really tired of getting sick with certainty every time I have been to a
demoparty.«»
«c4»«»
30th November:«»
«c2»«»
Managed to do the basic layout for all articles in the new engine today. It only took around 5 easy-going hours, which surprised me. Still, I lack adding in the bells and whistles - clipart which needs to be found and/or created and some creative use of different fonts and colouring. This was half of the part I dreaded would take the longest time, but it looks like it will turn out ok, at least with the new engine.
Yay.«»

Dr. Doom came by and tried to get the panels set up for the Classic Amiga EC Engine (CAEE?), but after 2 hours, he had to admit defeat, because of a non-working version of PPaint. He promised to look into it tomorrow instead (yeah riiight), and then he ended up throwing a party this night. Not much work done, but hey - I'm sick
;)«»

Spent 5 days being sick, boozing and seeing my girlfriend - not a wise move, I can see now.. Emboldered by the apparent ease of setting up 33% of the EC (one out of three engines), I might have become a wee bit easy going. In truth I still need to put in a lot of work each available day if we are going to get this out this month. Now I can see where it is going, and what is still lacking, and there's a lot. I can see the end though. And after the end, there're japanese PS2 RPG games waiting for me in the January vacation I will grant myself..
Joy!«»
«»
Anyway, today I set up the gallery in the Panorama engine - more or less completely, only lacking the text now, which is a snap to get in, once I figure out why the way I wanted to do it doesn't work. Guess I put in around 6 hours of work today. Tomorrow I will begin working on one of the huuuuge areas still left unexplored - the chart
part..«»
«c4»«»
7th December:«»
«c2»«»
Whew.. Tough day and I am getting closer to the mental institute after spending 10 hours with various EC doings. The sad part is that although I have managed to roughly set up the basic chart on the Panorama engine, there's so much more left to do. Luckily Hexagon is helping out by doing a script that can calculate and save bmp images of graphs, which will be great for the 170 chart entries (which I haven't even started on filling out yet). So, I managed to get all the basic data into the charts and set it up. There are now 170 entries with links that should lead to that individual scener/production/group and info about them, but which still do not do
that.«»
«»
Looking at the calendar, it seems I have roughly 4 days to finish up the Panorama version, one week to finish the Classic Amiga version, 1 week for updating the eurochart.dk database (and spending christmas with my family, hrm) and one week for finetuning/unforeseen
stuff/delays.«»
«»
Also, I still lack any EC intro, and it is looking grim in that regard. I lack gfx from Dr. Doom and Ransom has to include a working music replay for the Panorama engine and fix some bugs. Apart from that, Zerox, Hexagon, Ghandy and Darklight should also be working on stuff I'd like to get
included.«»
«»
«c3»'Ahehm'. «c2»We shall see about all of this.«»
«c4»«»
8th December:«»
«c2»«»
Didn't get much work done today, because I was mostly out of town attending a seminar. Did meet up with Ransom to go through some bugs and strange issues in the Panorama2 engine tho', and did some emailing and project
management.«»
«c4»«»
9th December:«»
«c2»«»
Another day spent focused on EC work. Spent 10 hours collecting all the clipart needed for this issue, as well as finalizing the chart results and writing them into the Panorama2 engine. Now I 'only' need to do those 170 individual chart entries. Oh, twice at least, for 2 of the 3 engines. Maybe this is something that will get cut out of issue 48, if time gets short (I can always hope, eheh). Dr. Doom also dropped by to fix the 68k Panels, and failed again. Better luck next time. Before I have to set up the layout for that engine preferrably. Anyway, in terms of work done, today was an ok
day.«»
«c4»«»
10th December:«»
«c2»«»
Party with Amnesty International today and demonstration against torture. Not too much Eurochart there, though I got some article support and wrote some
emails.«»
«c4»«»
11th December:«»
«c2»«»
Today, for lack of something better to do (nooo), I resized all the clipart and put it in the articles of the Panorama2
engine.«»
«»
Was that it? Roughly 8 hours work compacted into such a small sentence? Yes, seems so. Am I slow, or what? Or what I think, after all, I also wrote some long emails.. Hrmm.. No, but seriously, it takes an enourmous amount of time. Now I have finished one of the major work hurdles. I haven't yet set up the clipart nicely though, it's thrown into the articles a bit haphazardly. Resizing all the clipart and going through all articles multiple times took a lot of time. All in all, definately not a fun
day.«»
«c4»«»
12th December:«»
«c2»«»
A somewhat 'lighter', i.e. more fun day, with several different chores. According to plan I should have started on the 68k engine layout by now (and the Panorama2 layout should be finished.. Yeah right). However, although Dr. Doom tried to fix the panel, it's still fucked up, so I have continued working on the Panorama2 version. I went through all the articles, centering and setting up the clipart as nicely as could be done. Trouble is, there is a problem right now that makes the 2-3 last lines of the first column be blank, which fucks up the layout, so I can't finish it before this is sorted out. However, article layout is now almost complete :)«»
«»
I also wrote a TRSAC party report and finished my Mag Review article today - both were edited into the Panorama2 engine within minutes, complete with clipart. Not that difficult, once the basics have been done. The music selection was also finalized today - it's good to be the sole dictator, hehe. I think the EC has a very strong selection of diskmag tunes - in all versions, you should definately hear all of
them.«»
«»
Around 7 hours spent today. I should work more, but it's been a bit difficult finding motivation for more then 7-9 hours a day lately and today was actually mildly pleasant, because I had varied tasks and took my time doing
them.«»
«c4»«»
13th December:«»
«c2»«»
Started work on the 68k engine today - now I know why DISC died. Poor Zerox, having to do the layout in the DTP editor Dr. Doom supplied. Dr. Doom must really hate editors, it all becomes clear to me now.. It took me 2 hours to set up the first article in the editor. Admittedly, that article was no filler either, but still.. Dr. Doom likes pain.. The pain of others, obviously. Be that as it may, I learned the ins and outs of the 68k engine today, and managed to roughly set up around 1/4 of the articles at the same time, not bad at all I
think.«»
«»
Zerox sent in some more support today, hard working as he is. I fear he will run with all the writing glory this time around - I haven't much time to spare for such frivolity as actually writing articles. If I don't watch out, I'll end up as another Damian/Endzeit. Fantastic editor, but largely unknown, since he didn't have time for writing. Where are my slaves when I need
them?«»
«»
Ramble, ramble.. Today I worked for more or less 10 hours straight.«»
«c4»«»
14th December:«»
«c2»«»
Had to take a break from the EC today to do some semi real-life work and to see my girlfirend who surprisingly thinks I spend too much time in front of the
computer.«»
«c4»«»
15th December:«»
«c2»«»
Phew.. 16 hours of work today, counting 2 small lunch breaks. More or less a record I think, and one that hopefully won't get beaten too soon again, eheh. More or less finished menu, articles and clipart for the 68k version, as well as learning how to work most efficiently with it. That sure took some time. Especially the cliparts were a killer, as was the fact that I have to load the mag anew for each small change that I need to check. But overall, I have a good feeling now, because I did manage to finish so much. After tomorrow, I should be pretty close to finishing most of my work on the two EC versions. Then I can begin updating the eurochart.dk database, look at the C64 version, bug people (again) and begin polishing the chart parts. If I finish all of this next week, and people have also finished what they should by then, then the EC can get released between christmas and new year.
Yay!«»
«c4»«»
16th December:«»
«c2»«»
The work on the EC68k engine continued today, and I managed to finish up everything but the chart part. I also managed to find some cliparts I hadn't yet inserted, wrote some mails and well.. that was more or less it. 10 hours spent
today.«»
«c4»«»
17th December:«»
«c2»«»
Did the chart part of the 68k engine. Seems it will be bothersome for users to view 170 individual entries, because you can only go back to the main menu, not the last page viewed. So it seems like that feature won't be implemented in the EC 68k at present, hrmm. Did around 6 hours of
work.«»
«c4»«»
18th December:«»
«c2»«»
Added in more text, did some planning on the last stages and talked with Ransom and Dr. Doom about this stage. And I got to spend a day with my girlfriend. All in all I got in only 2 hours of work
today.«»
«c4»«»
19th December:«»
«c2»«»
Bad day, with me wasting hours on getting panels to work, but we're close to fixing that now.. At last. Also polished the layout of the EC 68k now, so that everything that is left to do with that version is final colourizing and adding the last
articles.«»
«»
A lot of smaller issues and bugs that have to be fixed pretty soon surfaced today though, and it took too much time thinking and talking about how to solve them, so I didn't get enough substantial work done, sadly. This, combined with the fact that I spent around 12 hours on the EC today makes it a frustrating day. Oh
well..«»
«c4»«»
20th December:«»
«c2»«»
I'm beginning to hit a wall now, in that there is not too much work for me left to do, without others finishing up their work, so I can continue. This is both frustrating and a bit worrying, as this might delay the mag (again). Ransom is still working on implementing sound in the Panorama versions of the Eurochart, and afterwards he has to do the final compiling to AOS4, MOS, AOS, Linux and Windows. Shadow or Xeron will have to take care of the AOS4 compiling and Ransom has seemingly wiped his MOS HD (ups), which means another will have to do that, or Ransom has to spend extra time setting up that HD again. Too many extra complications usually result in too much delay, and christmas is also getting
close.«»
«»
Also, Xeron will probably not manage to finish the EC C64 in time either, so I told him to send me all the articles and let me do the layout if he didn't get time for it. I just want to get the EC finished as soon as possible, and get this entire big thing out of my system, so that I can move on. And I don't mean that in any negative way, it's just that focusing on this project constantly is kinda' taxing, and it will be a relief when it's done. Any delays will put me in limbo, while I wait for it to be finished, so I might as well do whatever I can to bring it
out.«»
«»
On the graphics side, Dr. Doom promised me to finish the final graphics two days ago. Not a 2 year delay of course, but now the time frame is also considerably lower. Yesterday he promised to get certain things finished by today so that I could start finishing the chartpart. Today he didn't even dare go online, so that's not a good sign. There are quite a few loose ends in the graphics department, and they have to be tied together real soon too, preferably
tomorrow.«»
«»
Trouble also surfaced in regards to the font renderer on the windows version of Panorama vs. the other, SDL versions. Simply put, the two versions render fonts differently, resulting in around a difference of two lines for every column, completely messing up layout, especially in the chart part. Therefore I haven't been able to start finalizing the layout for these versions, and Ransom will now also compile an SDL port of the Panorama engine for Windows, so that all have the same font renderer. Before he does this however, and before Dr. Doom finishes layout for the chart part, I cannot start work
there.«»
«»
On the online front, it is currently not possible to add new entries into the database, meaning that sceners can't start voting again before that is fixed, and it would be best if they were able to vote just right after the EC is released, when there are hopefully many who are inspired by the EC release and go directly to the www.eurochart.dk page. Buzz promised to look into this, but again.. It is soon christmas, and he is also
busy.«»
«»
As for intros, that has been completely dropped. There is a very, very slight possibility of a PPC/PC intro still being finished, but I wouldn't bet on it.. At all. It would be a positive bonus
though.«»
«»
Ok, looking at the way things are now, one might maybe think that it is completely impossible to have the EC released between Christmas and New Years Eve. I think not, but strings will really have to come together during the next few
days.«»
«»
Today I mostly spent time trying to solve the problems listed above, inserting some more clipart and happily, writing 3 more articles, which felt really good.  I feel kinda' sad only doing the editing, I also want to write. As this log clearly shows ;-) 7 hours spent on the EC today I
think.«»
«c4»«»
21th December:«»
«c2»«»
And even slower day today, and frustrating to boot.. No incoming information about the state of the problems and work that still need to be done, so I am left more or less waiting without knowing what is happening (but I can suspect the worst). Business as usual. But of course, the scene isn't a well-run business, and creating things for the scene should be a creative process. Only too bad that big projects, whether creative or not, need a lot of disciplined work and focus. Hrm, well I'm not grumbling much, people understandably want to relax and focus on christmas, and have real-time jobs too - it's not like they are lazy. They could communicate better though, grumble,
grumble.«»
«»
Today was a more significant day for me than the 24th will be in fact, since it is midwinter's eve, or Yule, the original heathen celebration that was slowly replaced when christianity conveniently decided to place the birth of Christ around this period in order to directly combat and supplant the midwinter celebration. Lots of good stories there, but nothing I can write about in the EC,
so..«»
«»
Set up articles and clipart for the articles I wrote yesterday and began work on gathering info and productions about the Amiga releases of the last half year. This doesn't seem to be too difficult. It is not too fulfilling having spare time, eventhough I might need it tho'. Only spent around 5 hours on the EC today, and I just want to be able to finish it. Oh well, the next days it will be hard to get work
done.«»
«c4»«»
2nd January:«»
«c2»«»
Once again a longer delay and no Eurochart. While people are generally working very hard now, it suddenly stopped around the 21th for mysterious reasons, and it didn't pick up again before today. As I am dependent on the work of others right now, I had to wait too. Today I was able to start communicating with people again and get updates. Spent most of the day organizing and talking with people about the EC. That only took 2-3 hours though. Dr. Doom also delivered the chart gfx today, which means I have something to do tomorrow. I also managed to get TrickTrax to look at updating the eurochart.dk database for me, though I fear he will turn tail and flee when he sees what he has to do,
eheh.«»
«c4»«»
3rd January:«»
«c2»«»
Inserted articles, found clipart, inserted the chart panels and did other organizatorical things today. Before I can do any more major work, I need to get a version of Panorama that renders the fonts in a perfect way, since I can't begin the final Panorama layout or chart statistics if I don't know how much space the text is taking up on all versions. Spent 6 hours working
today.«»
«c4»«»
8th January:«»
«c2»«»
I really, really want the EC to come out now and get my January vacation, before January disappears. Today Ransom gave me a working, font-rendering, music-playing windows .exe to work with, and this evening the AOS4 version was finished. This made it possible for me to start the last stages of my work, which feels
good.«»
«»
I started finalizing the charts, but still need the final graphs from Hexagon, as well as all the pictures of productions, group logo's and sceners that I can get my hands on. This will probably be something I continue work on tomorrow. I also went through the mag and gallery part, and now mag layout is almost finished and just needs a last look-thru. Spent 8 hours today on
this.«»
«»
On the negative side, things are looking uncertain with both the C64 EC and the eurochart.dk database, so I will have to divert some attention to that too during the next days. All in all though, I feel we're getting close now. At long
last!«»
«c4»«»
9th January:«»
«c2»«»
Pieces are coming together now. I worked on making the chart part again today. The Panorama versions will be at least as good as the old EC chart was, with newer data and pictures, while sadly the 68k version will not be so pampered (this time), due to the technical limitations. Doing the 170 entries manually is every bit as aggravating as I thought it would be, and things I hadn't thought needed doing keep popping up. However, it will likely only take me 2 more days to completely finish that part now. The good old EC had this part fully automated, so it only took me some minutes to set up the entire chart with info, pictures and everything. Sigh, well that was
then.«»
«»
Hexagon finished the black/white graphs we will be using for this issue, and Ransom is veeeery nearly finished with all the versions of Panorama now. TrickTrax gave up on doing the EC database entries, saying that this was too sad a work for him to do. Yes, great, well I seem to be the saddest person in the scene now then, with all the sad work I am doing. Oh well, I managed to get Nutman into accepting the job instead, but now we'll see whether this creates
results.«»
«»
Haven't heard from Xeron as to the progress of the C64 EC yet, so this will likely be the one factor that delays the EC, since everything else is pretty much ready in a couple of days. Oh, haven't heard from Dr. Doom regarding extra buttons and extra headline gfx for the 68k version yet either. In fact I haven't seen him around on the net for many days, which is highly unusual. Hope he isn't hanging by a rope in his apartment now,
hrmm.«»

10th January:«»

4 hours of working with the Panorama chart today, didn't have time for more. Guess I can finish the chart part
tomorrow.«»

11th January:«»
«c2»«»
Whew! Now I am getting there. 15 hours spent today, the MOS, AOS4, 68k, Windows and Linux EC versions are now almost ready, apart from the very last fine tuning which I will do tomorrow and some work left to do by Dr. Doom and some final bug squashing by Ransom. I have no idea what is happening to the C64 version though, I haven't heard anything from Xeron. Haven't heard from Dr. Doom either, so that is business as usual. Maybe I should send my team mates on a 3 day lecture in project communication? But if I had the money for that, I would probably spend it on something else
instead.«»
«»
Oh well, finally this is coming together. I hope there's a small part of January left for me for that vacation I thought I was going to
have.«»
«c4»«»
12th January:«»
«c2»«»
More finetuning today - there is virtually nothing left for me to do, except for writing the editorial and the last words. Of course I save these for the day of release. Otherwise, I spent 4 hours today, and now I wait for the last contributions to come
in.«»
«c4»«»
17th January:«»
«c2»«»
While Nutman is close to finishing his work and Ransom has produced final versions of the mag, others haven't done anything or even contacted me, so now the final MOS Panorama version is about to get compiled by Kiero/MAWI since Ransom's MOS HD got wiped. When we get that one back, the EC is going to appear, with or without the C64 version and the last gfx. A line has to be drawn somewhere, and it is drawn now, so that we can get on with our
lives.«»

Yes.. You may laugh when noticing the days between the last entry and this one. I am not exactly laughing.. At all. It's been hell, mentally, but at last we're at the goal now. Kiero never really responded, Ransom spent a lot of time recreating his MOS partition and fixing a very simple, yet very hard to spot bug, and when the MOS version was finally ready - the final AOS4 compiling took another month. Why? Mostly because no one bothered booting up their AmigaOne and compiling it, argh. However, in the end Xeron stepped in and has now produced a working AOS4 version of the EC. So, with that I am scrambling to get the EC out of the door ASAP! Hopefully that will be tomorrow. Today I finally got Dr. Doom to do some rather nice headlines for the 68k version too, so everything is coming together now. I spent 7 hours working on it today, and just finished the editorial. Now all that is left is to get in the last 2 articles, and close up everything. It seems the EC will be finished
tomorrow.«»
