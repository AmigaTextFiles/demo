TRSAC 2005 PARTY REPORT«»

Geez, it seems like I have begun to loathe and detest writing party reports. Too bad for the TRSAC party which has been held the 25th to 27th November that I am the only one around to write such a report
then.«»

Honestly though, what's the point? You want to know what was released? Look at the results after this article. You want to know who were there? Look at the pictures we have taken. You want to learn about the releases? Go watch them yourself. What's left for me to tell? Sure I could tell you all about how my group mates and I boozed nonstop the whole party and were an absolute disgrace to the organizers. It would be a lie though - my group is getting to that advanced stage in life, where they either don't drink, or drink in a very quiet, almost timid way - you needn't fear the IRIS rowdies anymore (if ever).

So let's go straight to the normally dry and pretty irrelevant facts. Either you were there and don't care, or you weren't there, and don't care. Hey, why do I even care? Aghhh..

But anyway, TRSAC which has been oft delayed and oft thought dead, was once again held this autumn, close to the danish capital of Copenhagen, in some classrooms belonging to the Danish Technical University. As such, everything was rather crammed into the main 'hall', where the small bigscreen and ok soundequipment was located. A second 'hall' (ok, rooom it is) was also available and half filled. All in all, around 50 people were probably there for most of the time, with others popping in for a few hours here and there.

This party was for all types of computers, a general catch-all danish scene party. Feeling that we had to support this party, now that there're not many danish parties left (actually only one PC-centric party is being held annually in Denmark these days), we felt that we had to give the EC a break and compete with as much as possible, and so did a few others, judging by the releases (and the almost non-existant danish
scene).«»

I had the.. ehrm 'honor' of meeting the  upstart wannabe arrogant main editor of what passes for the competition these days, namely Browallia of Nukleus at this party. He and his mates from Nukleus had taken the trip and to be fair, the party shone a bit brighter for it. IRIS was the biggest crew present, both numerically and otherwise. We were Adonis, Darkhawk, Dr. Doom, Nutman and TrickTrax, with good old Hastur (who doesn't fondly remember Quest, come on?) popping in for a visit too. 
Apart from those, Curt Cool of Depth, Puryx of Scarab, Optima of Haujobb, Corial of Focus Design, Blueberry, Maytz, Psycho, Farfar and Booster of Loonies were there, as well as Selecta Novel of GNP. That pretty much did it, in regards to the Amiga sceners
present.«»

Ohh and what about facilities? You don't care right? Fine, then I won't waste many bytes on them. You could sleep where you wanted, which meant on a chair or the floor, there were toilets, most worked, and supposedly there were also showers somewhere at the university (surprise). Food.. Yawwn.. Yeah, there was a pizzaeria close by, and the city center of Lyngby was 20 minutes walk from the party place. There, that about covers it.

Did anything interesting happen at the party? Sure, it was actually a nice party, though it seriously lacked more intoxicated people (including people from my own group. Yes, I'm very ashamed to admit it). As usual I met up with people and got to chat with them, and as usual I wiped ass in Viper and KickIt, good and pure Amiga games both. However, the danish scene, while made up of nice people is a bit.. how shall I put it.. boring? They sit in front of their monitors, work and watch a few productions now and then. Occasionally they also smile a bit at passersby. Yeah, the atmosphere was a bit.. let's call it intimate. No big groups of people boozing and talking animatedly, people mostly kept to themselves in that typical Danish/Scandinavian/Northern Europe way. And since they didn't as a rule touch alcohol, things stayed that way. So, the best chats and happenings were between the Amiga sceners of course and internally in my group. Which was great of course.. I just missed lying unconscious in a pool of puke, so to speak..

Release wise, I could of course review everything Amiga related, but there wasn't much, and come on.. If you are at all interested in Amiga productions, you will check them out yourself. It's not as if it'll take you long to keep updated anymore, eheh. There were no Amiga demos released, but two fantastic crews fought for the coveted first place in the 64kb intro competition. Too bad for Nature that we were present and they weren't.. With no one to compete against us in regards to vote faking, we won the intro compo easily with our oldsk00l OCS/ECS intro. Nature got the second best place with a pure A1200 intro, and kudos to them for that.. better luck next time.

We were also forced to deliver a 4k intro, but Loonies must have votefaked better than us, because they won more or less closely followed by our entry. Both intros are very fast party productions however, and I am not sure they are (or should be, eheh) available
online.«»

That's it. Yeah, I hope TRSAC will be held again, but then I would wish for less tame, satiated, old people having a cozy time with their beers and more youthful energy exploding in wild orgies here and there. To be more
specific:«»
«»
- Less cramped space«»
- more boozing«»
- more events«»
- less danish people sitting in front of their monitors«»
- Earlier notice of when the next TRSAC is going to be held«»
«»
In short: MORE PAAAARTY! «»
