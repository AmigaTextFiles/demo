INTRODUCTION«»
«c2»«»
To  find  out  about the  past, present and future of the Amiga magscene, we 
have arranged  some  short  interviews  with  the  main-editors of the remaining
digital mags.«»
«»
Let's  first  have  a  look at the things that happened in the magscene last
year.   2004  was  actually  one  of  the worst years in the magscene ever.
There  was  one  issue  of  the  EuroChart  by IRIS (nr.  47), one issue of
Saxonia  by  Void  (nr.   3),  one issue of the new chartmag Versus done by
Nukleus  &  Void  in  cooperation, in addition to Jurassic Pack by Scarab &
mOOds (nr. 13).  That was all.«»
«»
When this article was created in early 2005, there hadn't been released one
single  issue  of  any mag.  If we look back at the latest years, there has
been  at least one mag out each January.  In January 2004 the EuroChart got
out, in January 2003 Taboo was released, in January 2002 D.I.S.C.  was out,
and in January 2001 D.I.S.C.  was launched, just to mention the last
years.«»
«»
With   this   in   mind,   we  asked  the  main-editor  of  the  Eurochart,
Darkhawk/IRIS,  the  main-editor of Saxonia and Versus, Rumrunner/Void, and
the main-editor of Cows n' Snakefights and Versus, Browallia/Nukleus, about
their  opinion  concerning  the  future  of  our  precious  magscene.   The
main-editors  of Jurassic Pack, Ghandy/Scarab^mOOds^Vantage and Gone/Scarab
were also invited to take part in our query, but none did respond in
time.«»

THE QUESTIONS«»
«c1»«»
ZX: What did you think about the magscene in 2004?  What were the
    highlights?«»
«c5»«»
Browallia/Nukleus:«»
«c2»«»
The  highlights  for  me  were  the four releases from different corners of
Europe.   These are Eurochart #47, Saxonia #3, Versus #1, and Jurassic Pack
#13 recently before Christmas.  Sadly, they all just managed to release one
issue each.«»
«c5»«»
Rumrunner/Void:«»
«c2»«»
Well,  I  don't  think  that much happened.  There are of course the rumours
about  the  "new"  EuroChart, but I haven't seen anything yet.  I hope that
they  don't  fall into the trap we have seen many times before, often, when
big  changes  are  to occur, the mag gets discontinued, and I don't want to
see  that  happen  again.   For my own part, I'm not happy about not having
released  more issues of Saxonia, but I think that will change soon.  Also,
I have Versus to concern myself with now.  It takes time.«»
«c5»«»
Darkhawk/IRIS:«»
«c2»«»
Eurochart issue 47 in the beginning of the year, and Jurassic Pack issue 13
in December.  Also, there was a release of a new chartmag, but its contents
and  quality  are  not  yet  anywhere near the league of the aforementioned
mags.  A slow year for the magscene, but compared to the rest of the scene,
not that slow, and it seems like we might get some mags in 2005 too, so all
in all, it isn't so bad.«»
«c1»«»
ZX: What do you think will happen in the magscene in 2005?«»
«c5»«»
Browallia/Nukleus:«»
«c2»«»
I  think  it  will  be  a  better year for all sceners beeing involved with
diskmags.  Here are my thoughts in numbers.«»
«»
I  guess  Eurochart  will manage one issue (#48) before March.  Versus will
manage  two  issues, while Cows n Snakefights will only fix one issue (#6).
Saxonia  will  probably  release  two  issues.   Then I think Jurassic Pack
probably  manage  one  issue  this  autumn  and  I  hope for a comeback for
Showtime in the end of 2005.«»
«»
I  sense  a bit more competition between the diskmags.  Here's one example:
Except for Eurochart, no other groups can fix a better chartmag than Versus
by  us  and  Void  at  the moment («c1»uhm, there are no other chartmags? -
ED). «c2»But if we should not continue, I have a strong feeling that Worldcharts or 
Jurassic Pack are the closest candidates for  taking over.  This is great, so I 
don't fear that the Amiga charts will disappear that easily.«»
«c5»«»
Rumrunner/Void:«»
«c2»«»
Well,  I  can  only  speak for myself here.  I plan to release more Saxonia
issues with updated code, and of course more issues of Versus in cooperation
with  Nukleus.   This is a chart, not a mag but there's work on both and it
takes time, however, I think that there will not be so much to do in school
up till' the summer exams, so I think I will have more time for the
Amiga.«»
«c5»«»
Darkhawk/IRIS:«»
«c2»«»
I  think  the  EC,  JP  and  Versus will continue to come out.  There won't
likely  be  new mags, but then again, those that we have, are not likely to
die either.«»
«c1»«»
ZX: What about your own mag? When do you plan to release the next issue?«»
«c5»«»
Browallia/Nukleus:«»
«c2»«»
The  plan  was to celebrate Nukleus 10 years in the scene with a release of
Cows  n Snakefights in December 2004.  But we failed and will release it as
soon as possible.«»
«c5»«»
Rumrunner/Void:«»
«c2»«»
That's  hard  to  say,  but  everybody who wants to contribute should do so
already.  When I first decide that now I WILL release a new issue, I don't
ask  around  for articles.  I put together the ones I have and then release
it.  Everybody can contact me at rumrunner@sensewave.com.«»
«c5»«»
Darkhawk/IRIS:«»
«c2»«»
As soon as possible, more or less, which still means that it will take some
months, but late winter/early spring should see a release of the Eurochart. 
(«c3»f****ck, you poor, naive bastard - ED)«»
«c1»«»
ZX: What's the future plans for your mag? Will it change in any way? Get
    new sections? New features?«»
«c5»«»
Browallia/Nukleus:«»
«c2»«»
As  our  group  philosophy,  we  will keep one crappy and one serious side.
Sadly  this  leads  to  a  lot missunderstandings and complains.  Indeed we
listen  to feedback, but what to say, we can't please everyone and taste is
different.  Some new features will be seen and more articles from us.«»
«»
We  don't have articles and time for lots of texts in both Versus and Cows n
Snakefights,  so  most  articles  are  given to CnS.  I don't know Void's
strategy with Saxonia, but it is probably the same.«»
«c5»«»
Rumrunner/Void:«»
«c2»«»
Well,  the first is small codeupdates.  I have planned to make mouse support
for issue four, and perhaps sometime even support ahxmodules.  Article-wise,
it's  up  to the contributors, I myself write about what's on my mind there
and then.«»
«c5»«»
Darkhawk/IRIS:«»
«c2»«»
Yes,  I  guess the Eurochart is close to its biggest change yet, going very
much  multiplatform,  at  least in regards of who can run the thing, if not
the  actual  charts,  getting  a  totally new code, and also new direction,
charts-wise, though it will still be about the Amiga.«»
«c1»«»
ZX: What do you think about the editors of the present scene? Will you
    continue to be active writing in 2005?«»
«c5»«»
Browallia/Nukleus:«»
«c2»«»
I  guess  most editors will keep on writing in diskmags instead of internet
magazines.   My  opinion is that an  article  for  a  diskmag  simply looks more
reliable  and  trust-worthy.   Also it would be great if the polish editors
want to share their thoughts in the English language instead of the polish
one.«»
«»
To  write means a lot of time being active in scanning our environment,
e.g.  what's happening (the 'scene research').  As an editor, the most time is 
not spent writing but reading everything from the smallest file_id.diz
to checking the web.  I can hopefully afford to take time doing that for 2005 as 
well.«»
«c5»«»
Rumrunner/Void:«»
«c2»«»
Well,  the  releases are few, but there's a lot of quality work to see when
something  finally  happens.   I  hope that this keeps up, but I would also
like  to  see  more frequent releases.  I will continue my best in both the
coding and editorpart of the scene.«»
«c5»«»
Darkhawk/IRIS:«»
«c2»«»
Well,  there  are  not many editors left.  This is almost cliché, but true.
Of the old, experienced editors of the past, only a few are yet alive, 3 of
those  writing  for  the  EC.   Editors like, Ghandy, Kaosmaster, Zerox and
myself are the only mastodons left, but then there are also some newer and
fresher   editors   out   there,   like  Gone  for  instance («c1»not anymore
- time flies - ED). «c2» Still,  the articlewriters  tend  to  be  more  and  more  
sceners who write one or two articles a year, with the more professional, full-
time editors dying out as a breed.«»
«»
And  yes, I will continue to be active during 2005.  Bringing out one issue
of  the  EC  even as big as it usually is, is not really being that active.
It  takes  1-2  months  of work, and apart from that, I haven't really been
doing much, editorwise last year.  However, I hope that the future will see
at least 2 issues of the EC each year.«»

«c4»CONCLUSION«»
«c2»«»
We've  reached  August  now,  and  we've  seen  issues  of  Versus,  Cows n
Snakefights  in addition to Jurassic Pack.  Since you're reading this text,
also  the  EuroChart finally got released after a delay.  The future of the
magscene  looks  actually  quite  bright.   We  will  definitely  get  more
magreleases this year compared to last year, despite of the slow start.  It
seems  like all main-editors replying are eager to continue making diskmags
the  next years.  We will get more issues of the EuroChart, Saxonia, Cows n
Snakefights and  Versus.   In addition to that, Jurassic Pack is apparently
not  dead  after all.   Last year it was declared that the final issue of JP
would  be  issue 13, but when that issue was released in December 2004, the
only  real  change was that the main-editor Zito had vanished, and Ghandy &
Gone  wanted to continue  the project.  Now Gone has quit though.  We never
know  if new mags might appear either or that older mags reappear.  Also in 2005
the  Internet  mag  Kubika  got  launched, and with the multiplatform
strategy  of  the  EuroChart,  more  readers  will have access to the Amiga
scene.   Therefore sceners should welcome the future of the magscene with a
positive  attitude.   Without  mags, the scene will eventually fade away as
mags always have had a very special role.  They've reported everything that
moved  in the scene, and even more important; they've been a motivation for
other  sceners.  When sceners get publicity and appreciation, it gives them
a  push  forward in their strive to reach a goal.  The goal is naturally to
have fun while making stunning new productions.«»
