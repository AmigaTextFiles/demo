Stroke Commodity 1.2 (12.6.98)

~~~~~~~
What is Stroke Commodity?
~~~~~~~
Stroke commodity is a mouse-controlled Intuition event 
generator. That's a short explanation. A longer version explains 
that you can draw different symbols using the mouse and the 
commodity will then interpret them and insert the appropriate 
events into the input stream, such as menu shortcut keypresses.

Strokes are most useful with a 3-button mouse. You assign the 
middle button to be the stroke 'key'. Press the button down, draw 
a symbol, and release the button. Stroke commodity will then 
check what you wanted, creates the corresponding input events 
and inserts them into the input event chain.
