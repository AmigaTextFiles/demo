Crystal Software Games
**********
Crystal Software have finally released details on three of the 
games that they have scheuled for release on the Amiga. Two of 
these, Tank Goblins & Gilbert Goodmate have been mentioned 
before, however, The Dark Millennia is a new game never seen 
before and it certainly looks good. Details & screenshots on these 
three games can be found below... 


Gilbert Goodmate 
This is a game that was announced ages ago and many had 
thought at one point that it has disappeared, this couldn't be 
further from the truth and the game is progressing very nicely. For 
those of you that do not know, Gilbert Goodmate is point-and-click 
game in the mould of Monkey Island 3. Among other things it 
boasts digital recorded speech throughout the game and a CD 
soundtrack. Some of you may remember the demo of this that was 
released a while ago, well, as you can probably tell from the 
screenshots the game looks nothing like that anymore, this is one 
department in which it has substantionally improved. One of the 
reasons for this is that the development team has an ex-disney 
artist who is creating the charactors. The game will be released on 
both Amiga and PC formats, both versions will be in the same box 
so helping get Amiga games back in the shops. The scheduled 
release date for the game is currently July 1999. 


Tank Goblins 
This is another game that you may have heard of. It was featured 
in one of the Amiga magazines a while back, however, nothing 
else was heard of it until Crystal Software signed it up. Tank 
Goblins is a 3D shoot-em-up that uses a perspective similar to that 
of Sega Rally. The story of the game goes something like this.. 
There have been many changes in the Goblins world, the once 
lish greens of their forest filled world have been burnt to a 
desolate frazzle by the mass depletion of their ozone layer. As the 
planet got hotter and hotter, instead of joining as a force against 
their affliction, the two orrigional clans became three, then four, 
then eight and so on. There soon became many different factions 
each striving for its own way of survival, this bought about trade, 
but as the plannet got hotter, the one thing every clan wanted 
none had or was not willing to admit to having, Water. Soon clans 
marked territories and any other goblin entering their territory 
faced instant extermination or held for ransum for water. The 
player plays the part of a goblin known as a Grunt (a grunt being 
someone who does someone elses dirty work for money), whos 
one tool of trade is a tank. Throughout the many levels that the 
game consists of you have to complete various missions and 
above all stay alive. After each level you are given the chance to 
buy new add-ons for your tank including new drivers/gunners to 
improve the performance of the tank. Some of the features that 
tank Goblins boasts includes digital speech, cut scene animations, 
atmospheric soundtrack which changes to the condition of the 
players status in the game, real time rendered updating, good AI 
for enemies and possible Network linking so you can death match 
with anyone over the net. Tank Goblins is scheduled for a 
December 1998 release. 


Dark Millenia
The Dark Millennia is a real-time stratagey adventure game based 
on a story which takes the game player through a series of 
chapters. The players decisions and choices decide the outcome 
for the next chapter, thus giving infinite ways of reaching the final 
chapter. There are two competing forces within the game. One 
represents all that is good and honourable, the other representing 
all that is dark and evil. The player has a choice of either to play. 
The setting/scene for the game is Fantasy Medieval, with the 
player controlling armies of Goblins, Dwarves, Elves, Giant 
Spiders and many more. This is not a shallow game. Dark 
Millennia has the player creating armies and towns with an 
econamy, simular to game like Settlers and Populas. Each force 
has unique characters to control and to train to aid in the quests. 
Fighting skills, spells, potions, these are all here to be learnt or 
bought. The game boasts some very impressive features, these 
include AGA 256 colour lo-res/hi-res screenmodes, Full AHI 
sound support, Vidiscreen Systemm real time shadowing, sun 
rising and setting, smoke, fire, rain FXs. The authors also plan to 
add GFC card & PPC support, Digital Speech and cut scene 
animations. Dark Millennia is scheduled for a December 
completion.

Phoenix Update - First 3D Engine Screenshots
**********
Finally, new screenshots of this eagerly awaiting game have been 
released. The Adventure part has been seen before, however, 
until now there has been none of the actual 3D engine released. 
Phoenix is a 3-D space combat game which also includes a 
massive Adventure element. It will be comparable to games such 
as Wing Commander and Privateer. In the game you fly from 
planet to planet which is represented by an excellent looking 
polygon generated engine which also uses texture mapping to the 
full. The Adventure part could be a whole new game in itself, you 
will meet vast numbers of different creatures and people as you 
aim to complete missions, fight pirates and generally explore. The 
graphics in the adventure part of the game are drawn by the 
extremally talented Emmanuel Henne, some of the graphics from 
this part of the game look stunning, just look around this page for 
a few examples. All of these graphics are in 256 colours. The 
game consists of 15 different planets in 4 different star systems, in 
each of these star systems there are countless numbers of 
different charactors to meet. The 3D engine in the game is so well 
designed that it supports upto 20 different spaceships at the same 
time. Lots of these spaceships will be at the players disposale 
ranging from a simple one-man fighter to massive spacestations. It 
is also planned to include TCP/IP support in the game for internet 
multiplayer games. The game will require an A1200 with at least 
an 030/50mhz and 4Mb Fast RAMand a HDD. It will also have 
support for more powerful machines such as 040/060 machines 
and GFX card equiped machines. The game is currently due for 
release sometime in November, hopefully a demo won't be too far 
away. For more information on the game check out the homepage
