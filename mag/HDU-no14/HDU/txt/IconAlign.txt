Short:    Arranges Workbench icons orderly

===========================================

If you ever tried the "Clean Up" feature of Workbench and were 
not satisfied with the result, this program might help you.

In my opinion, "Clean Up" has several problems:
* often it changes the order of the icons in a random way instead 
of just aligning them
* it always tries to align icons in vertical columns first
* horizontal aligned icons are aligned at their top edge instead of 
their bottom edge, which gives you non-aligned filenames if the      
icons have different sizes
* you can only clean up all icons in a window at once
* you can not give a starting position for the alignment

IconAlign has none of these problems. It allows you to specify a 
starting icon that remains unchanged and a number of other 
icons that will be aligned according to the starting icon. You can 
have either horizontal or vertical alignment at your choice and 
optionally equal distances between the icons in the other 
dimension (which will also sort the icons in the order you have 
named them). Horizontal alignment is at the bottom edge of the 
icons (to give you aligned filenames), vertical aligment is 
centered (like "Clean Up").

IconAlign is not as easy to use as "Clean Up", but it will give 
much nicer results.
