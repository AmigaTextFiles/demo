Amiga Survivor News
===============================================
Below you can find a statement recently released by Amiga 
Survivor telling about some new goings on regarding the 
magazine. 

Hello Amiga fanatics! 
Well, Amiga Survivor is proving more of a success than any of 
us could imagine. Our print-run increases every month and new 
subscribers are added to our database daily. Even after a mere 
three issues! And now everyone around the world can have a 
taste of it. Amiga Survivor has recently had a complete 
overhaul, both the magazine, and it's official homepage 
http://www.crystal-software.com/AmigaSurvivor/survindex.html. 
Go see for yourself the new-look covers, new logos, and get 
information about distributors and contents of the magazine. 
Since the new look and new promotions, many stores around 
the planet are now stocking issues, in the US, Canada, The UK 
and the rest of Europe. Have a look at the website to see if 
there's a store near you! Or you can order online and have each 
issue delivered to your door! At one point in it's life, Amiga 
Survivor was just a games magazine, but due to it's popularity, 
it has grown to covering more 'serious' items, with the help of 
some ex-CU Amiga staff members. And in the coming months, 
AS is set to gain more pages, and the possibility of swelling to 
an A4 format! Amiga Survivor has also recently gained the 
rights to distribute the incredibly popular U.S publicaton, Amiga 
Informer in the UK! Be one of the first European residents to 
own this fine magazine by ordering it from the Amiga Survivor 
website.

even more popular, so if you're an Amiga stockist anywhere in 
the world, then you could be one of the many distributors to

Survivor is available via mail-order only, and not on

Napalm Release set for November 1st.
===============================================
ClickBOOM have finally set a release date for Naplam, it is 
November 1st 1998. The game based on the likes of Command 
& Conquer & Dune 2 has been eagerly awaited by many for a 
long time, it'll be good news to these people to know that its not 
far away now. Many were left dis-illusioned by the demo which 
failed to work on quite a lot of systems, I'm told that these 
problems will be fixed for the final release. However, for those 
people that did get it working, it was a very nice taster of what 
looks to be one of the biggest games of 1998. The game 
features some amazing looking graphics, looking expecially 
good in the high-res mode and going by the demo it certainly 
has the playability to match it. As usual with clickBOOM games 
the presentation is also excellent. Hopefully the full game will 
live up to all expectations. More info about the game can be 
found on the clickBOOM page, there are also a number of deals 
available on here to those that pre-order the game.

will be presented at the Computer '98 show in Cologne by The 
Real Ologram. The game will initially be distributed and 
published by The Real Ologram and then will be available direct

This is just the tip of the iceburg regarding Amiga games at the 
Computer '98 show. There is a host of other titles that are going 
to be presented and released at the show, all of which I will tell 
you about in a preview of the show which I will be writing soon. I 
have also heard rumours of a massive surprise for Amiga 
gamers, I can't really say anything yet except that you should 
upgrade and get yourself a PPC and GFX card as quickly as 
you can. For more details on Olofight check out there webpage

=============================================
Max Rally.
=============================================
Max Rally is a multi-player overhead racing game that has 
been under development by newcomers Fortress who plan 
to develop games for the Amiga. It is now set to be released 
this week, the 5th of October is when they are taking orders, 
with it priced at £19.99 UK Pounds. Their first title Max Rally 
works on all Amiga's with at least 1.5 MB of memory and 
involves up to four players participating in different types of 
racing against each other, against the clock or up against 
intelligent computer controlled cars. 

In Max Rally you get to choose your own driving character 
with 6 characters to pick from with each driver having their 
own unique driving attributes. The game offers many 
different challenges for you to try out such as the 
Championship where you face up to three computer 
controlled cars on 20 different tracks which include various 
terrain's such as Woodland, Cosmic, Snow and Sand. It's up 
to you to come out top but it won't be easy as you have to 
come out top of all 20 tracks and if you fail on one track you 
have to replay it - the next problem is that you only have 5 
continues. If you complete that you can go on to the Max 
Rally Challenge where in addition to completing the 20 
tracks, you have five Max Rally Challenge tracks that must 
be completed. These are totally original and unique styles of 
racing set on the Cosmic terrain but according the 
developers you'll have to find more out about that ourselves. 

There is also a multi-player mode for you to play against up 
to four of your friends either through one Amiga or through 
two Amiga's if you have a null-modem cable. There is also a 
Time Trials section which allows to play against the clock to 
beat other people's lap records on tracks. Other players can 
also join in where you will have to beat each others fastest 
lap times.
