«as»
«c7»Almost one and a half year ago, in late October 2000, «c6»Amiga «c7»announced the first new
amiga hardware in 6 years. Just to recapture a bit. The first
product from the "new" amiga is called «c6»AmigaONE, «c7»and it will run a single
piece of software named «c6»Amiga Digital Environment (DE). «c7»The Amiga DE has
the ability to host itself on multiple hardware and operating system
platforms, which gives us all a chance to chose the hardware that best
suits our needs and taste. We can use a PC if we'd like, but the best
part is of course that our current amigas also can be upgraded to run
Amiga DE if I have understood this correctly.«»
«»
A partner of Amiga, «c6»Eyetech, «c7»got the mission to create some products to
achieve certain goals. With these add-in products, old amiga
machines will have a modern graphics chip, full classic compatibility,
G3/G4 CPUs and industry standard expansion options. And the machines will
be able to run the Amiga DE.«»
«»
«»
Anyway, the specification is following on the next page:«»
«»
«»
«»
«al»- CPU/One AmigaDE friendly host processor (x86, PPC, Arm, SH4, MIPS)«»
- Graphics: Next Generation Matrox graphic chips (probably G800)«»
- Sound: Creative EMU10K1 chip based audio card«»
- RAM: Minimum 64MB«»
- Drives: 10GB+ HD, DVD/CD player (both)«»
- Expansion: 2 free PCI slots, Firewire«»
- Other: 10/100 Mbps Ethernet, 56k modem, USB 1.0«»
«»
«»
«as»The first products based on the spesification mention, are The Amiga One
1200 PPC and the Amiga One 4000 PPC. These are add-in cards for the «c6»classic
A1200 and A4000. «c7»They will make use of PPC accelerator cards. These models
will dual both «c6»AmigaOS 3.9, «c7»and the new AmigaDE. These cards can infact
also be run without any A1200 or A4000 motherboard, but then without the
AmigaOS 3.9 compatilibility. bplan Gmbh will make stand alone Amiga One
computers with PowerPC processors. By the way, in AmigaOne, One stands for
it being a single processor. As you understand, Amiga will provide
the new revolutionary software and their partners the hardware.«»
«»
This was the news which we got a long time ago, but what has happened since
then?«»
«»
There were alot of announcements at the «c6»official amiga website, «c7»so let us
just take a brief look at all of these from the new beginning of Amiga Inc
until today.«»

«»
«as»«c7»These were the last announcements until the last days of December 2001.«»
«»
«c6»Anyway, in the announcement the 11th of June last year, «c6»Bill McEvan «c7»told
that some new amiga products were coming in some weeks:«»
«»
AmigaOne PPC /1200 - On Schedule and Rockin'«»
AmigaOS 4.0, and shortly thereafter AmigaOS 4.2 on schedule for release Summer
of '01 and will offer the next generation of Amiga desktop - on PPC! 
AmigaDE 1.1 so the rest of the world may begin to learn the power of Amiga 
for Cell Phones, and other portable devices.«»
«»
This is the «c6»essential announcement «c7»and news for the amiga community. The
other announcements are more structure and partnership announcements.«»
«»
But what has happened since June as the products still haven't reached us?«»
«»
There have been total silence about what's happening concerning these
products at the official amiga site until the very end of December last
year. Because of this, not only «c6»Amiga Inc
«c7»got criticized but also its partners. So why this silence? «c6»Eyetech «c7»answered
to this in an email to the amiga community in the very beginning of
October.«»
«»
They told us that «c6»"Everyone wants certainty in announcements, either to
plan and be reassured, or to snipe and start rumours. There is no point
in making announcements while negotiations are still proceeding and 
therefore some aspects of the outcome are still uncertain". In addition to
that they added "Amiga Inc has been on the verge (and still is) of obtaining
a substantial funding package for the past few months, which would clearly
change the resources available for the project substantially. We have all
been hoping to make a joint news announcement incorporating this and its
effect on the A1/OS4.x project". And last Alan in Eyetech wrote "There are
many individuals providing input to the project and they all need to be
consulted prior to making substantive announcements. In fact I'm probably
breaking my own code of conduct in this respect by posting this note".«»
«»
"It seems also to be a common knowledge that Amiga Inc are having some
difficulty raising their second round of finance since the tech meltdown
earlier this year. This has inevitably had an effect on the level of
resources that they have been able to put into the A1/OS4.x project,
and there has therefore had to be a reallocation of financial and operational
responsibilities within it across the other partners. This all takes time
(and money) to sort out and so, yes there have been some delays", «c7»Eyetech
told us.«»
«»
Anyway, Eyetech did assure us that «c6»OS4.0 «c7»is under way and should be
released sometime in November, just as Amiga Inc had assured us earlier.
However, that didn't happen but it won't take long before it's finally
here. Hyperion Entertainment has now taken over the project it seems.
This means that it should be out the next months for all of us that want
to get our hands on it.«»
«»
In an interview with Bill McEvan for the german edition of AMIGA
aktuell published the 7th of October, also Bill McEvan answered to the
critisism about the silence. He told us that because of some earlier
critisism that Amiga Inc were telling too much, they reduced the
announcements. And then people critisized them for not telling enough, so
Amiga Inc wanted to end up in the middle instead.«»
«»
The more interesting part of his small interview, was that Bill McEven told
the amiga community that the «c6»AmigaDE player «c7»was to be released very soon, and
now it's released! And Bill McEven also told us that there will come some changes and a new
attitude and some new products soon.«»
«»
«c6»Eyetech «c7»also announced that «c6»"The AmigaOne which is to be released
shortly is the first new Amiga System to be designed for nearly a decade.
In addition to providing an upgrade and transition path from the Classic
Amiga hardware and OS,  the AmigaOne and OS4 will provide the sort of levels
of performance only previously dreamed about by Amiga users. So as well as
impressing existing Amiga users we also expect the AmigaOne to produce some
real head-turning and jaw-dropping amongst the Windows-using fraternity.".
«c7»Eyetech have been working together with Naya Design to create the housing
for the AmigaONE. It's made of a machined aluminium chassis and backplate
together with gold tinted plexiglass sides and top. It also features a
near-silent PSU. Pictures of the new design of the tower have also been
published. And an AmigaOne-ready A1200 tower system
with a "Barebones" configuration was offered for sale. So that amiga owners
can add their own peripherals to build into a customised system.«»
«»
As written before, Amiga Inc was silent for around 6 months before Bill
McEvan broke the silence around Christmas. He apologized for announcing
new AmigaOS products to be available in November last year, when they
weren't ready. Bill McEven also promised updates more often in the future,
even though Amiga Inc is very busy these days with working on many
products.«»
«»
In the announcement around «c6»Christmas «c7»from Amiga Inc it was written alot about Amiga
Digital Environment (and the new AmigaDE enabled devices), AmigaDE Player, 
AmigaDE SKD 1.1, AmigaOS and AmigaOS 4.0, AmigaONE and more. But learning
from earlier mistakes, no releasedates were given. The project is entering
its "final stages" doesn't really tell the amiga community much as we have been
waiting for more revolutionary Amiga products at least the latest 5 years.
This means we all have to continue to check out the webpages of «c6»Amiga Inc,
«c7»and it's partners in «c6»Eyetech, Haage and Partner, Hyperion Entertainment «c7»etc.
carefully the next months.«»
«»
As for the AmigaOne, Bill McEwen at least assured us that «c6»"the AmigaOne is 
very real, will be a product that you can buy, and on which Amiga will grow
into something of which we can all be proud.".«»
«»
«c7»A few days ago, the 22th of January Bill McEvan kept his promise from
Christmas, and updated the Amiga community about the latest happenings. He
just told us about a new partner of Amiga, called «c6»STB OEM.«»
«»
«c7»As a conclusion of the various statements of Amiga Inc and their important
partner, Eyetech, the amiga community and the amiga scene should look
forward to some new products very very soon. Probably the new amiga
products, such as AmigaOS 4.0 will be out in the next months, and hopefully
the AmigaONE as well.«»
«»
Well, we all have to wait and see.
Remember that Amiga Inc. already have delievered some versions of SDK for
the new AmigaDE, launched AmigaOS 3.9 and have made deals with bplan and Eyetech
to create AmigaONE, in addition they have also made lots of deals with
other partners to create various products. This can only be good for the
Amiga and the Scene!«»
«»
While we are waiting, Amiga Inc are continuing to get more partners so the
Amiga can have a great future. At the moment there are more than «c6»3000
developers «c7»developing for Amiga! And the main-partners of Amiga are working
hard on their respective products. So no need to leave the Amiga lifestyle now...
2002 will certainly be the year of the big comeback!«»
«»
At the end, do remember the words of Bill McEvan:«»
«»
«c6»"To those of you who continue to try and tear Amiga apart, it is time to stop. 
Amiga is moving forward, there are great things ahead, and for the first time 
in many years, the Amiga family will have new products, and choices.".«»
