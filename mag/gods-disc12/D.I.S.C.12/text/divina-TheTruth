«c7»In the EuroChart issue 41 I wrote an article called «c6»IRIS - Behind the
Curtain «c7»where I warned you all.«»
«»
What did I warn you about? Well, just read the article yourself and you'll
soon discover it. Generally I warned you about the «c6»"friendly" «c7»forces of IRIS.
So here I'll just include a small quote from that article: "There are not
many mags left in the amiga scene these days, but somehow you find articles
from the organizer of IRIS in all of them. It «c6»can't be any secret «c7»anymore
that IRIS fight for worlddomination. At first they are just friendly and
support all mags, but soon they start to take over. I suspect that IRIS will
have all the mags left within a year to spread their propaganda. The EuroChart
was just the beginning... so «c6»watch out editors".«»
«»
«c7»Well, no one took my warning serious. First «c6»IRIS infiltrated the EuroChart,
«c7»and now it's a fact that the EC issue 44 will be an issue only done by
them. They fast got Depth out of the way. But this is of course not all,
they've continued to support all the other mags as well... and one by one
they will take over them. Little did I know when I wrote my last article
that «c6»D.I.S.C. would be the next mag «c7»out.«»
«»
Therefore it's time to tell you «c6»the truth about dirty affairs! «c7»The IRIS
guys work in full secrecy, and gradually make all the mags depending on
them. And now this is also the case with D.I.S.C. In this issue it has
already been made a coop project between «c6»GODS and IRIS. «c7»But the question we
all ask ourselves is: for how long? It's as always just a matter of time
before the old D.I.S.C. team has been overthrown as well, and another mag
has «c6»fallen into the arms of IRIS.«»
«»
«c7»So again I warn the few mags and editors out there that are left; be
careful or you'll get the «c6»same destiny «c7»as the oldest mag alive: D.I.S.C.
and the oldest chartmag alive: The EuroChart, very very soon!«»
