«as»Humus 2 «c7»is the sequal to Humus which got released at the Assembly party the
previous year. But the similarities don't just stop there.«»
«c6»Humus 2 consists of 11 fabolous parts. «c7»It starts off with flare bobs
forming the name Humus. The exact same effect was however also used in the
4k intro Humus last year. The second routine is a big changing object
displayed over a very colourful moving background. Then follows a tunnel
with walls that are changing colours. Afterwards a very BIG and colourful
object which is changing alot appears in front of a moving background.
The next routine is a fast and colourful tunnel, which also was used in the
first «c6»Humus intro. «c7»Then we get to see the number 2 done with flare bobs.
Again we get to see a big object in front of the same background as used in
effect nr.4. Another fast tunnel appears with walls looking the same as the
background in the previous routine. The next effect is alot of flare bobs.
After that a twisting object appears with the same colourful background as
in the second effect in this intro. And at the end, we get to see the name
Exploder with flare bobs.«»

All in all, it's a very good 4k intro which didn't only manage to «c6»win «c7»in
front of «c6»King Of Fuck by Spaceballs & Ephidrena, «c7»but also beat all the PC
«c6»competitors «c7»at the Assembly party. If there are any negative aspects of
this 4k intro, it got to be that some of the «c6»effects were recycled «c7»and that
the music isn't very good. Apart of that, this got to be one of the «c6»best 4k
intros ever. «c7»Humus 2 at least offers alot of nice routines... so if you
haven't seen it already, then do it now. It should work on about all amigas
really.«»
