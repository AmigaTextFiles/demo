«as»«c7»Depth is a group which got founded in Denmark back in July 1993. It's actually
a result of two totally unknown and unproductive groups joining forces.
Those two groups were CURE consisting of Curt Cool, Gismoduck and Folcka,
and the crew CONIAC with Quedax and Nightsight. Together these 5 guys
started a group which we all should get to know later on, as «c6»DEPTH!«»
«»
«ac»«c5»THE DEBUT«»
«»
«as»«c7»In March 1994 the first production from Depth got released. It was a
«c6»chippack «c7»featuring music by Curt Cool, code by Quedax and graphics from
Nightsight.«»
«»
Only a few months later on the next issue of their «c6»CoolTunes «c7»got released,
it was in June. This time not only Curt Cool did the music, but also Trip
contributed.«»
«»
In December the last issue of «c6»CoolTunes «c7»got out, it was created by the same
people as in the previous issue.«»
«»
This was the first year of productivity from the new group Depth. And
already at this stage the group had been noticed by other sceners. Not
mainly because of their productions, but because of their weird behaviour
at various parties. I remember them at one party (The Gathering 94 or The
Party 94) running around in doctors clothes plain crazy.«»
«»
Depth also began to get members in alot of various countries, and still
today they have members in countries such as Denmark, Norway
Finland and England I think. In the past they've also had members in some
other countries, like in Poland and Sweden for instance.«»
«»
«ac»«c5»KEEPING UP APPEARANCES«»
«»
«as»«c7»The next years Depth released quite many productions really. They created
an intro simply called «c6»Weird «c7»at the South Sealand party in coop with IRIS.
It was done by Elohim and Ib. Depth also did a «c6»4k
intro «c7»in August 1995 done by Paithan for the code and Curt Cool for the
music. And one called «c6»Elefont «c7»with code by Paithan, but with music by Solo at
the same month.«»
«»
Depth released some swaptros with code by Hangman, graphics by Opal and
music by Timer.«»
«»
In April 1996 Depth released a 4k intro at the Gathering party featuring
Paithan (code) and Solo (music).«»
«»
At the South-Sealand party in June 1996 they released the demo called
«c6»Darkhawk Er S0d «c7»(Darkhawk is cute), which is also spread under the name Vi
Elsker Darkhawk (We Love Darkhawk). It was coded by Presence, while Folcka
and Ib did the graphics and Cytron the music. At the same time, the
animationdemo called «c6»Puost «c7»got released. It was created by Elohim, Folcka,
Ib and Trip.«»
«»
In August 1996 they released «c6»two 4k intros «c7»at IO3, done by Cerber and
Hangman.«»
«»
Not very long after, in October 1996, the joketro «c6»Bol Boller «c7»got released
at the SM'96 party. It was coded by Blueberry, with Cytron doing the music.«»
«»
«ac»«c5»THE BREAKTHROUGH«»
«»
«as»«c7»In 1996 Depth was still not one of the most famous groups around, but
it had been rumoured for a about a year that they had taken over the
«c6»EuroChart «c7»from Static Bytes. And in December 1996 the first issue from
Depth got released. It was EuroChart issue 28. The code was done by 
Quedax, and the new main-editors were Cytron and Curt Cool. The music and
gfx got of course changed from each issue.«»
«»
In February in the year of 1997, Depth released their winner demo called
«c6»Tetsuo «c7»at the Scene Meeting. It was created by Optima which did some code
and graphics, Internet did also some gfx, and Curt Cool did the music.«»
In March another issue of The EuroChart got relased. It was issue 29.«»
«»
At the Mekka-Symposium in April Depth released a 40k intro called «c6»Bol. «c7»It was
coded by Presence, graphics by Folcka and Ib, and music by Trip.«»
«»
Issue 30 of the «c6»EuroChart «c7»got released in May.«»
«»
In June 1997 the first production coded by Cytron got released, it was the
demo «c6»Frankofon. «c7»A tribute to Curt Cool. Cytron also did everything else in
this production. Cytron also coded another production there, it was a
sponsordemo for the TCP97-party called «c6»BebeToTeFoFu. «c7»Cytron also did the
music and graphics by the way. At the same party also a 40k intro called
«c6»Placebo «c7»got released. It was coded by Optima, gfx by Ib and music by Trip.
At the Kindergarden party, they released the 64k intro «c6»Chexue. «c7»It was coded

«ac»«c5»THE LATEST YEARS«»
«»
«as»«c7»The latest years Depth haven't been that active as in the past. But still,
in February they released issue 36 of the «c6»EuroChart. «c7»And in April
at the Mekka-Symposium party in 1999, they released 3 productions. It was
the crazy «c6»AlpenClub52 «c7»demo coded by Cytron, gfx by Ib and music by Cytron.
Depth also released the «c6»Kryptonite 40k intro «c7»there, which came second in
the competition. It was coded by Kollaps, graphics by Ib and music by Curt
Cool. And last, they released the 4k intro called «c6»Str8. «c7»It was coded by
Cytron, music by Cytron and gfx by Ib. They also managed to release yet
another issue of the «c6»EuroChart «c7»this month. It was issue 37.«»
«»
In July the follow up to Kryptonite was released, it was the «c6»Kryptonite II 
«c7»40k intro released at the Scene Meeting. Both the code and music was done
by Kollaps.«»
«»
In August the last issue of the «c6»EuroChart «c7»entirely done by Depth was made.
It was issue 38.«»
«»
At the end of the year, in December, «c6»Depth in coop with IRIS, «c7»released
issue 39 of the «c6»EuroChart.«»
«»
«c7»In the very beginning of the new millenium, Depth released an intro called
Lonely. Cytron created it totally by himself.«»
«»
In April yet another issue of the «c6»EuroChart «c7»in cooperation with IRIS got
released. It was issue 40. The «c6»EuroChart «c7»issue 41 got released in the
autumn that year.«»
«»
Last year, 2001, Depth in coop with IRIS released «c6»EuroChart «c7»issue 42 in
February. This is actually the last real coop issue with IRIS, as Depth
didn't contribute in issue 43. Nevertheless, issue 43 released in July this
year is consided to be the «c6»last issue «c7»under the Depth & IRIS label
together. The next issue suppose to be only done by IRIS, and will probably
be released in a few days.«»
«»
At the Trsac 3 party in October Depth in coop with Haujobb and TRSI,
released the demo called «c6»Bizzare Love Triangle. «c7»At the same party it was
also reported that Depth released a «c6»musicpack «c7»in THX format done by Cytron
(code), Ib (graphics) and I guess we all know which members who did the
music, hehe...  Anyway, I haven't managed to get hold of this production
yet. At the Kindergarden party in November, Depth released a small production
(dentro) named «c6»Arcane Lugter. «c7»It was coded by Cytron and Sprocket did some
gfx. I can't really tell you anything about this production as it crashes
on my machine. In any case, Arcane Lugter was also the last
production so far that I know of from Depth.«»
«»
«ac»«c5»WHAT NOW DEPTH?«»
«»
«as»«c7»What's the future of Depth now? They've been involved with amazingly 16
issues of the EuroChart and released LOTS of intros & demos in the past.
The latest time the group has turned more inactive though, and now last the
famous chartmag EuroChart is no longer under their label either. The main
persons behind Depth the latest years, like «c6»Curt Cool and Cytron «c7»are quite
busy with many other things. Curt Cool is studying much (read: partying),
and Cytron has got himself a more than well-paid job. In the beginning of
2002 Depth also kicked a few members for inactivity (Bucko and Rolex).
Despite if this, Depth still have a few productionplans. A few days ago a
new coder named «c6»Skurk «c7»joined in Norway, and he's already working on
something. It also seems like Depth
plan to release (more) issues of their new musicpack in THX format.
I'm sure we'll get to see many more crazy productions from them in the
future.«»
«»
For those that haven't seen the productions mentioned here, try to get your
hands on them. Mostly they're «c6»quite weird. «c7»Therefore it's not the usual
kind of style you've seen so many times before done by other groups.«»
«»
Hopefully we'll see many more productions from this «c6»crazy gang! «c7»Good
luck to you all.«»
