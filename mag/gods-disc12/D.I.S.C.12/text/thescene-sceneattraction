«as»«c7»There is not any community, big or small, that can survive without any new
«c6»recruittation. «c7»Therefore also the scene need new sceners to survive in the
longrun. The latest years the scene have decreased alot, and if we do not
manage to stop this and attract some new people, the scene will eventually
become incredible small and fade away. With that in mind, I asked some
sceners what we should do to «c6»keep those sceners already here and to attract
some new ones «c7»into our small community.«»

«c7»What should we do to get more people attracted to the amiga scene, and to keep those already here?
I dont think its possible to attract new 'normal' people to the amiga scene. Some
people from other scenes might have a go at doing amiga stuff ,and they are often
involved in music or graphics on amiga these days.  The divx videos of amiga
demos have attracted some interest from people who simply like to watch demos,
but I dont think that these few will start learning the amiga in order to release
anything. Generally its more natural to look forward and develop yourself on the
pc rather than to go backwards in time to the amiga platform. New people start
out on the pc, and may not have such a relationship to the amiga :)«»

How to keep the people already in the amiga scene in the scene. Then we have to
continue making stuff worth being here for. Great demos, music and graphics
mainly. And keep the community informed through the net, swappers channels and
diskmags. A scener left alone with nobody watching his stuff except for a few
uninterested network geeks or people who compare your stuff to the latest 3d
movies from hollywood,  will not stay a scener for long.  Everybody need some
attention, approval, fame  and feedback on their creative skills in order to keep
going. Thats our type of money. Another release that goes unnoticed equals to
another scener losing interest. If atleast somebody would say that it was crap.
Even that is more encouraging than nothing at all.«»

«c7»People should be more openminded! People should help new potential sceners
when they have the change! IRC talk with people which join Amiga related
channels! And not offend them, as some people do!«»

«c7»I thought for long that the demographic of Amigascene
was getting older all the time, all new groups that
started were newformed by old members. The truth is,
that the Amigascene has an instream for outcomming
people.
Actually you cant convince people to stay if you dont
enjoy it yourself.«»

Its better to be inactive, than get out of amigascene!«»

«c7»I think it can be difficult, because people get older, and find the things in life. 
To attract new people....well, people have to have the basic interest in coding, music
or graphics.«»

«c7»Getting new people to join the Amigascene is hard since few people in
general uses Amiga. There is of course some people using Amiga that is
not sceners so maybe some of them will be interested in the demoscene
one day and join.  But it's doubtfull they'll be many.  Anyway, new
people from other platforms also have to be converted from gamers to
sceners first.  At least in Norway, sceners are not the usual kind of
people to find.  But there are signs of a 3rd generation of pc-sceners
slowly growing.  We must welcome them and help them into the scene.
When they have become more experienced, then maybe they'll be ready for
scening on an alternative computer like Amiga.«»
«»
The posibility for the Amigascene to grow is very small.  Sad but true.
Amiga had to become a new bestselling computer again for that to happen,
so that many people would own one.  Now, PC is the bestselling computer
that outclasses Amiga in both hardware and price. No one would buy old
hardware for a higher price than the newest multigigahertz PC with all
the stuff you could dream of.  Just think of the price and performance
of a 060 compared to the latest cpu from AMD/Intel.«»
«»
When a new potential scener would discover the scene it would most
likely be on a PC.
It would actually be easier for him/her to start on the PC scene to
since finding resources, likeminded people, groups to join and so on,
wouldn't be so hard.  In the Amigascene, especially new coders are hard
to find.  On the PC that is not such a big problem.  There is more
people and one can use languages like C++ and Java to write demos.
Learning assembler is hard and learning the hardware is even worse.
Documentation of Amigahw is not easy to get hold of these days.  Also
writing a demo in asm takes much more time and fiddling with bugs than
in C++ or Java.  If you connect the real world into this it would be a
waste of time to learn 68k-assembler.  You can get a very well payed job
as a C++/Java programmer (and you would be one helluva coder after some
years in the scene to) but very few needs someone who knows 68k asm.«»
«»
How do we keep the existing Amigasceners then?   This is also hard since
most Amigasceners are getting old.  The time and interest left for
scening is decreasing with the same speed one is growing older.  Some
marry and get families.  Maybe the final studies at schools/universities
takes too much of your time.  Some people with scenebackground even
code/do gfx/(and maybe even music) for a living and going home from work
to do even more does not tempt many.  With little or no recruiting to
the Amigascene it will eventually die.  Sad but true.  But while it's
still alive we should do the best out of it and make some real kickass
productions.  That at least gives inspiration for the existing
Amigascene to do more and maybe even inspire the PC scene.«»

«c7»Amiga cannot keep the pace with PC hardware, so stop upgrading. Lets take
focus on a standard setup that most Amiga sceners can come up with and
produce demos only for this configuration. By this active Amiga sceners
don't have to upgrade anymore but still can enjoy their scene, and
on the other hand it may attract new people, since it may be interesting
to come up with art instead of all being about hardware.«»

«c7»Maybe  we  should  use  our  abilities  to  make  scene more active, do more
original  production,  think  up  some new projects.  All we need is to stop
being lazy, nothing more.«»

«c7»I was about 2 years on PC scene. AMiGA scene fascinated me with
climate and not dying friendship. Scene-man it is necessary to be born, and
I think that we don't get army of attracted people :)«»

«c7»I have no idea ... To be honest, I don't think we can do more than we're already
doing. Perhaps more people should start attending parties? And perhaps party
organizers could pay a little more attention to their visitors. Assembly and The
Gathering for example, are disasters compared to Mekka Symposium.«»

«c7»I really don't have any solution to get more people attracted in the 
amiga scene, but you can be sure that a lot of people will stay in
the scene if everybody still tries to be better than the rest. this 
brings a challenge: trying to be better next time. additionally it 
brings fresh wind into the scene, new effects, new ideas. and this 
will keep the people stun about releases, and this is what will 
chivvy us along! at least i hope all this.. ;)«»

«c7»In order to attract more people into the Amiga scene it has to be something
they want to participate in. We must consider what it was that drew our
interest in the first place, and then figure a way of re-establishing that
same attraction for others. Unfortunately, I feel that this is no longer
possible. What can the scene of today offer to the average computer user?
Friendships can be established over the Internet regardless of whether
you're a scener or not. The skills one can learn from the scene can now be
learnt in college and can ultimately lead into a paid profession. Freedom of
speech and creativity can be achieved via web pages and newsgroups.«»
«»
As for the second part of the question I feel there is no solution. I do
not know why so many people continue to use the Amiga when the PC offers a
bigger, more productive scene visually superior and generally higher
quality productions, and, of course, a wider audience to appreciate one's
hard efforts. Those who already own a PC not only have the benefits of a
thriving commercial market and a thriving scene, but they have the option to
emulate a high spec Amiga at no additional cost. Speaking
as a newly converted PC owner, I can see no possible way of winning these
people back.«»

«c7»To get people attracted.. That is almost totally out of our hands.. Once every
3rd or so years I manage to get a person interested in the scene, but it's
hard.. It's up to those owing the Amiga to get it known again, with e.g. the
AmigaOne, so that more people will come, the userbase will expand, and then we
can start advertizing ourselves more again.. if we like the new computer
anyway. As for what we should do to keep those already there.. Build more
community spirit. Feel like we belong to a greater, cooler whole, be able to
meet and chat with other sceners, share our views and hobby. Groups are ideal
places for this. Meetings, parties, IRC, letters, sharing knowledge, teaching
eachother, etc.. Make the scene an interesting place :)«»

«c7»Maybe we should just promote the amiga a lot more... most amiga users are
members of the PC scene, maybe we should all keeping asking the the PC
scum that amiga is a true machine and deserves a chance.... Or when there is
contests, keep it amiga only...«»

«c7»Important is to make the Scene more public for the Amiga owners worldwide.
Many people only know about the cracking scene and comdemn it, they even
have never heard about the demoscene that we know. More demoscene related
articles in papermags or banners on big homepages would help.«»
