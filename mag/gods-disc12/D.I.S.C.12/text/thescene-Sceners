«as»«c7»Have you ever wondered what happened to all those «c6»famous sceners «c7»that suddenly
left the scene?«»
«»
After a few minutes of research, we give you the results of our inquiry.«»
«»
Have you ever wondered what happened to «c6»Brainwasher Of Eremation? «c7»- the man behind
several mags and demo/intro projects, is reported to have started his own
company some years ago and is busy hosting it.«»
«»
Do  you  remember the journalist behind the most revoltionary diskmag
ever?  Do you remember «c6»Lord Helmet/Spaceballs? «c7»He has been working at a computer
company as a system developer for some years now.«»
«»
And what happened to the coder behind a few D.I.S.C. intros? What happened
to «c6»Zendar/Gods? «c7»He has also created his own company and is currently
developing a game together with a few other friends, like Bridgeclaw/Gods.

And then, what happened to the famous creator of the Stone Cruncher utility
and numberless demos and intros? What happened to «c6»Mr.Spiv/Complex? «c7»He's
working in the tele-company Sonera.«»
«»
Ever seen the fantastic demo called Virtual World by Tom Soft? Well, what
happened to the coder «c6»Thomas Landsburg? «c7»He's currently working in a
video-game company called Start-Up.«»
«»
«c6»Polka Brothers «c7»was a group with much success around 1994. But what
happened to them? «c6»Merge «c7»went to work in London, «c6»Airwalk «c7»disappeared after
his military service, and «c6»Gargoyle «c7»is working at Funcom. His last project
was Anarchy Online. And «c6»Slide «c7»works in an advertisement agency it seems.«»
«»
Do you remember «c6»Zytrox/Gods? «c7»He was the maker of the old D.I.S.C. and
Jurassic Pack diskmag sources. He's busy coding educational programs
these days.«»
What about «c6»Wolfman/Balance, «c7»the maineditor on the Upstream series? He chose
to study journalism, as a result of his scene days, and is now a
journalist.«»
In the same vein, «c6»Christine De la Queen «c7»is working in an advertizing
bureau, probably her own, if we take into account her ambitions.«»
«»
Or the creator of the glenzvector and many other things, what happened to 
«c6»Celebrandil «c7»of Phenomena? Well, he once had a job where he sold Nike and
Adidas shoes, but right now he is between jobs.«»
«»
Then we have «c6»The Spy «c7»from Crionics, once one of the most famous sceners
ever. He works for a Danish phonecompany now.«»
«»
Or what about the most known scener ever? What about «c6»Chaos «c7»of Sanity? He
is doing games for the consoles now, and have been doing so for quite some
time.«»
«»
Anyway, nobody can really say if these sceners finally have left the scene or
not.  Some seem to have faded away, but others may be sleeping...  just as the
sleeping  gods.   Good  bye  to the «c6»faitfull departed sceners...  «c7»hope we will
hear lifesigns from them again.  Perhaps on other platforms, we never know...«»
