«as»
«c7»Poland  has  introduced  lots  of  good  groups during many years.  These days
especially groups like «c6»Appendix, Potion and MAWI «c7»are impressing many sceners.«»
«»
The  latest  years «c6»Mawi «c7»has been hyperactive, and these days it's probably the
most  active  group from Poland.  And in 2001 it was certainly also one of the
best  and  most active groups at the present scene.  Therefore it was time for
us  in  D.I.S.C.  to  look  closer  at MadWizards - a group which do not only
release intros and demos, but also slideshows, musicdisks, diskmags, packs and
more.«»

«c5»WHAT IS THE MAWI?«»
«»
«c7»Mawi  was  founded  already  back  in  1995  by  «c6»Hero  and Seti, «c7»but the scene
activities  didn't  start  before  the swapper «c6»Ctp «c7»and the musician «c6»Van Ghorne 
«c7»(Vagon)  joined  in  May 1996.  Ctp has since August 1997 been better known as
«c6»Azzaro.«»
«»
«c7»In  June  1996  the  first  production from Mawi got released, it was the 64kb
intro  called «c6»Frey.  «c7»It got released at the Polish Summer Party.  In September
the  same  year,  «c6»McR «c7»joined.  Today he's the co-organizer of the group.  Also
that  month, Mawi released another 64kb intro called «c6»Morgoth.  «c7»It got released
at the Intel Outside Party III.  Since that time Mawi has never released a non
AGA production again.«»
«»
Later  that year, in December to be exact, Azzaro became the new organizer and
quite  many  members had joined the Mawi forces.  Their new «c6»Save Da Vinyl «c7»pack
continued  to  get released as well, and it has continued to be released until
2001 at least.  The latest issue so far, is nr.31.«»
«»
In  1997  Mawi  began to get real active.  They started off by releasing their
chippack  «c6»Save Da Vinyl «c7»and a preview of a slideshow called «c6»Visable World.  «c7»In
the  summertime  they released their first 4k intro called «c6»Persil «c7»at the Intel
Outside  Party  4.   Later  Mawi  released  lots of productions at the Gravity
party,  among  them  their coop demo «c6»KAH835GB «c7»together with Floppy.  They also
released  many  4k  intros  there,  like  «c6»Confusion, Delight 2, Fire & Ice and
Petrol.   «c7»And  for the first time Mawi also started to get good results in the
competitions.   In  October  they  released  their first dentro, which was the
«c6»invitation  to  the  Astrosyn party.  «c7»The month after the first issue of their
famous mag «c6»Excess «c7»got out.  At the very last month of 1997, the group released
another issue of Excess, a 64kb intro called «c6»Sacrebleu «c7»and the 4k intro «c6»Brick,
«c7»in  addition  to the «c6»dentro Excess «c7»at the Astrosyn party.  So I guess the Mawi
members  got  to  have been quite happy with the activity level in the year of
1997!«»

«c5»THE RISE«»
«»
«c7»If  you  thought  Mawi  was  active  in  1997,  you'd better believe they were
hyperactive  in  1998!   As the previous year had started and ended, also 1998
began  with  «c6»Save  Da  Vinyl «c7»getting released.  In March Mawi released «c6»two 4kb
intros  «c7»at  the  Spoletium  party.   At the Rush Hours party in May, the final
version  of  the slideshow «c6»Visible World «c7»got released.  At the same party lots
of other productions got out aswell.  They released a video-demo together with
Floppy,  called  «c6»Fragments,  «c7»a 64kb intro named «c6»Revolution 909, «c7»the 4kb intros
«c6»Thud  Remix  «c7»and  «c6»S38ZB4, «c7»and the 256 bytes intro «c6»Midge, «c7»which by the way also
won  the  compo!  In June more issues of «c6»Save Da Vinyl «c7»got out, in addition to
the  Excess  promotion  dentro  called  «c6»Radion  In Your Eyes «c7»(at the Abduction
party).   In August Mawi released their «c6»The Girl With The Sun In Her Hair «c7»demo
at  the  Quast  Party  6.   At the same party they also released the 4kb intro
«c6»Missed  «c7»and  the  mag  «c6»Excess issue 3.  «c7»And the month later, Mawi striked back
again  at the Gravity Party 3 with releasing their first winning demo!  It was
called  «c6»Automatikk for the people.  «c7»Mawi also released a PPC-demo in coop with
Venus  Art  called  «c6»Absolon, «c7»a 4kb intro called «c6»Diao «c7»and «c6»Save Da Vinyl 14.  «c7»In
November  the  Mawi  gang  went  to  the Satellite party.  There they released
another coop demo with Venus Art, called «c6»Drowned Offshore, «c7»a winning 4kb intro
called  «c6»Oaid,  «c7»the  4kb  intro  «c6»Pocou  «c7»which  came  second, a 64kb intro named
«c6»AudioFrequencyModulator,  «c7»another  promotion  dentro  for  Excess called «c6»E4, «c7»a
«c6»video  demo invitation «c7»for Astrosyn, the video demo «c6»Poser «c7»and another issue of
«c6»Save  Da  Vinyl.  «c7»And that was the end of a very active and successful year of
Mawi.«»

«c5»WHEN WINNING IS ALL...«»
«»
«c7»Also foreign sceners had started to get their eyes open for Mawi after all the
releases  the  latest  years.   But their real international breakthrough as a
very good demo group, probably came in 1999.«»
«»
The  mag  «c6»Excess  «c7»got  released  at  the very beginning of 1999, and Mawi also
released  an «c6»invitation dentro «c7»to promote the Astrosyn 2 party.  But it wasn't
before  Mawi  visited  the  Astrosyn party in March, we heard from them again.
There  they  only  released  a «c6»videodemo «c7»together with Plastic.  It was called
«c6»Central  Industrial.   «c7»Their chippack «c6»Save Da Vinyl «c7»also got out in March.  In
May  the preview of the «c6»Datablade «c7»demo in coop with Floppy won the competition
at  the  Rush Hours'99 party.  At the same party Mawi also released their long
awaited  slideshow  called  «c6»One Spiritual Journey «c7»and another promotion dentro
for  Excess  named  «c6»Cameo Innerloop.  «c7»The quality releases from Mawi just kept
hitting the scene, and I'm sure the Mawi members were pleased.«»
«»
In  June  another  issue  of «c6»Save Da Vinyl «c7»got released.  The month after Mawi
went  to  the Xenium 99 party.  There they released the final version of their
«c6»Datablade «c7»demo together with Floppy.  It won again!  Mawi also released a 64kb
intro  called  «c6»Eclipse, «c7»which also won the competition.  But that was not all,
Mawi  released  their first musicdisk called «c6»Sonikk «c7»and last, another issue of
«c6»Save Da Vinyl.  «c7»Again it was a smashing party for the Mawi crew.«»
«»
The  month  after «c6»Excess «c7»issue 5 got out, in addition to another «c6»Save Da Vinyl
«c7»pack.   And  in  September  Mawi  went  to Apocalypse 99 to release their demo
«c6»Utopia.   «c7»In  November  the  slideshow  «c6»Photocell 1x1 «c7»done in cooperation with
Anadune  got  released.  It's a slideshow with pictures from Kazik done in the
period  of  1996-99.   Most  pictures are fantasy creations, but some are also
copies.   At  the Satellite party Mawi released the «c6»Mute12 «c7»demo which also won
the  competition!   I think it's a pretty cool demo with a special atmosphere.
It  has some blurred wireframing, nice pictures, a nice landscape routine with
a  very nice 3d man-object flying above.  It got a testuremapped question mark
which  is  tranforming, it got a nice MadWizards logo, some more 3d objects, a
real  fast colourful tunnel, and an impressive routine with the screen divived
into 4 with lots of routines in each corner and more being added.  It got even
more  wireframing,  some  blurred  dots  over  a  Mute  12 picture, some great
pictures  and more blur, many fast changes between pictures, some really great
3d  objects  which  is  phongshaded  and  transforming  in  front  of a moving
background,  a  very nice flower object with a woman object beside it, a kinda
tunnel  effect,  more  blur  and  objects,  and a routine with a great picture
being  revealed  slowly,  a  sort of picture waving routine and a picture of a
woman  etc.   Quite an entertaining demo!  Mawi also released another issue of
«c6»Save Da Vinyl «c7»that month.  In December they released yet another issue of that
chippack, and the first issue of their new pack called «c6»Zosia.«»
«»
«c7»1999  was  certainly  a very successful year for Mawi, and now lots of sceners
from all scene countries had seen their work.«»

«c5»KEEPING UP APPEARANCES«»
«»
«c7»In  January  2000  another  issue of «c6»Save Da Vinyl «c7»got released.  And the next
month,  yet another issue of the same pack.  In February also issue 6 of their
mag  «c6»Excess  «c7»got  out.   In  April  Mawi  went to the Mekka-Symposium party to
release  a  4kb intro called «c6»Polychrome.  «c7»Also new issues of «c6»Save Da Vinyl and
Zosia  «c7»got  out, in addition to the new party slideshow «c6»Overview.  «c7»In June the
second   issue   of   «c6»Overview   «c7»got   released  with  more  photos  from  the
Mekka-Symposium  party.   Also  another  issue  of  «c6»Save Da Vinyl «c7»got out that
month,  and  a  few  more during the last half year of 2000.  Another issue of
Zosia also got out in 2000.  At the summertime Mawi went to the Assembly party
to  release  their «c6»Metatag «c7»demo.  The only demo Mawi released that year.  Mawi
slowed  down  on  the intro/demo front in the year 2000, after the hyperactive
1999.   But the year 2001 should reveal that the productivity of Mawi is still
high...«»
«»
«c5»RELEASES LAST YEAR«»
«»
«c7»In  2001  MadWizards  has  released  a  couple of issues of «c6»Save Da Vinyl, «c7»the
latest nr.31 quite some time ago.  Mawi also went to the Mekka-Symposium party
to  release  the demo «c6»Amsterdam Blessings «c7»which came third in the competition.
The  demo  got  3  main  parts, the first one with some routines like a moving
projector  with  crossfaded  graphics.  The second part got a tetroniqdon 2276
faces  object,  a  creditspart  with  cubic  objects rotating, some blobs with
env.mapping,  a  lighted texture mapped cavern, some morphing cubes, 3d object
motion camera, some texturemapped 3d tunnels, a mountain rotating object, some
morphed  rotating objects, some nice pictures and more.  And the last part got
some lightshaded objects, transparent bumpmapped scroller etc.«»
«»
Mawi  has  also released issue 7 of their mag called «c6»Excess «c7»last year.  At the
Assembly  party  in  August  they released a PPC demo called «c6»Cull Bazaar «c7»also.
And  at  the Symphony'01 party in September, Mawi released their third demo of
that  year.   It's  called «c6»Cruel Karma Forms «c7»and won the demo competition.  At
the same party they also released issue 4 of their Zosia pack.  And last, they
released «c6»Elemental World «c7»- another video demo, there.  Later on that year Mawi
released  two issues of their «c6»Overview «c7»production, the last one being issue 8.
At  the  Delirium  party  they  released  the  demo  «c6»212,  «c7»which  also won the
competition.   The  last  release I saw from Mawi in 2001, was their musicdisk
called «c6»Mu51k «c7»featuring Substance, released in November that year.«»
«»
«c5»THE FUTURE«»
«»
«c7»Mawi  was  very active last year, with releasing 4 quality demos, a musicdisk,
mags,  packs  and  other releases.  And there's no indication that this polish
power  will  stop  in the near future.  Especially not now as several talented
members  joined  them  lately.   We  don't  know what the next production from
MadWizards will be, but we do know it will be good...«»
