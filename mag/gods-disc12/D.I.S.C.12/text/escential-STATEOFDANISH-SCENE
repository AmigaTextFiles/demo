«as»«c7»This is not a report of the danish
scene, although you might come to
think of this as one. It's more of a
listing of the active/alive groups in
Denmark, what they do, and an
explanation of where the other groups
went, it's a report of what is
«c6»*actually* «c7»happening in the danish 
scene.«»
«»
First off, «c6»there IS no danish scene
anymore! «c7»Yes, shocking, but true, just
as it's mostly true that there's any
national scene, besides the one in
Poland. In Denmark this is even more
true though, as we haven't gotten many
groups left alive. Who are alive in
Denmark?«»
«»
«c6»Gunnars FarveBio (GFB) Depth, Loonies
and IRIS «c7»are alive. Not many, eh? We
can't really have a real scene in
Denmark with so few groups. «c6»GFB
«c7»consist of 2 men, «c6»MZ1453, and his
brother, Dr. Who. «c7»They now and then 
work on an intro or one of his 
megademos. Last release of GFB was at 
the TRSAC 3 party. It was another «c6»megademo.
«c7»So, GFB are still 
there, and quite reliable for some
productions now and then, around 1 or
2 a year.«»
«»
«c6»Depth's «c7»active people have been «c6»Cytron
«c7»and mainly «c6»Curt Cool. «c7»I hope we'll
still see some productions now and
then from them, but well, even their
organizer doesn't really seem like
this is all that likely, although Curt
Cool is flinging out diskmag mods like
never before, hehe. They also did the
«c6»EC «c7»until now, and managed very well,
wouldn't you say? Without that
production though, they'll probably
not do much except some fast fun
production now and then. Most members
in Depth are either inactive or
inactive honour members. This is fine,
but not so fine for the danish scene,
naturally.«»
«»
The we have «c6»Loonies, «c7»quite the known
group and quite active too, latest
productions were a fastly recycled «c6»64k
intro «c7»of TBL's Perfect Circle, aswell
as the TRSAC «c6»invitation intro «c7»and «c6»an 4k intro «c7»at the party itself.
Yes,
they're active, and nghhh.. ngghh..
yes, some of them are somewhat
talented, hehe.. See, I can be
objective too. Loonies is an active,
danish only group.«»
«»
And of course, we have «c6»IRIS «c7»too. We're
international, but most members are
from Denmark. Well, never seen us as a
'danish' group anyway, but.. We're
releasing «c6»EC and DISC, «c7»we made a
slideshow called «c6»The Puppets «c7»lately,
aswell as a chippack called «c6»Noise from
Heaven 3, «c7»and hopefully there's
something out from us for the MS
too. We're, modestly speaking, the
group who releases most productions
every year (12-14 I think). Well,
whether you like them or not.. That's
another matter, hehe.«»
«»
But anyway, what it comes down to, 
being harsh, is that we can't really 
talk of any danish scene at all, with
only 4 more or less active groups in
Denmark, «c6»our national scene is dead!«»
«»
«c7»Dramatic statements aside, we kinda'
know this, don't we? I think «c6»Zerox's
«c7»country review is slightly off the
mark, in listing a lot of groups who
you've likely never heard about, and
who only existed for one or two fun
productions, but then faded away. In
Denmark today, there are only the
groups I've talked about active in the
danish Amiga scene. There are also
other people of course, I will mention
the two other people who're active
sceners here in Denmark, and that's
«c6»Puryx from Scarab and Optima from
Haujobb. «c7»So, couldn't I have missed
someone? Some groups or some people
atleast? Maybe, some people might
decide to hobble some fun production
together now and then, and maybe use
some groupname, but «c6»the real state of
the danish scene is that we have 4
active groups in our scene, and 2
sceners «c7»from groups outside of these.«»
«»
What about «c6»Efreet «c7»you say? Well,
Blueberry is in Loonies and pretty
busy. Now and then, like at SM one
year ago, they released a little
thingie, but beyond doing something at
a little party if they meet up, they
aren't really active or even alive.«» 
«»
Once we had this danish chartmag,
Dansktoppen, which was revived from
the good old days by people mainly in
«c6»Cromatics, «c7»and ran for some issues
with humour intended for around 4
other danish sceners, heh. Well, that
one died with Cromatics, or let's say,
Loonies should formally have taken it
over, but nothing has happened, and
there's not really any point either,
the scene being so small here in
Denmark. So, my point is that we don't
have any kind of national scene
whatsoever, but this is no surprise,
of course we need more than 4 active
groups to have such a community, and I
guess many other countries fare the
same way.«» 
«»
So, there isn't much happening inside
the danish scene. Well, we know
eachother, «c6»we're friends and we have
some degree of competition running,
«c7»but not that much, our efforts are at
making an impact in the international
scene, not competing inside Denmark
anymore, we're simply too small for
that now. Instead, we, as the rest of
the scene (except for some polish
groups, who have enough in their own
country, and indeed they have, since
there're many groups there) know that
it's not much fun competing internally
anymore. So, «c6»there's not much
nationalism or danish scene pride
left. «c7»Gone are the days were we had
more than 50 active groups and so on.
Actually those days have been gone for
around 10 years.«» 
«»
So, when doing danish scene reports,
the sad truth is that there're only 4
crews to write about, and 2 of them
aren't even releasing much either.. 
«c6»Go ahead and kill me for that remark, 
if you're alive, that is!«»
