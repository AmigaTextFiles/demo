«c7»Of Wolf And Man. What have become of us? The «c6»D.I.S.C. Team «c7»have been
radically reduced since the last issue due to various reasons. Firstly,
we have retired the worlds best scene journalist ever; «c6»Lord
Helmet/Spaceballs «c7»as he more or less left the scene over 6 years ago and is
busy being a father these days. Secondly, due to lack of support from
various people, we had to re-arrange a bit, and thus it took longer to
produce this mag. In any case, this was no less than an extreme disappointment 
for us, and it makes us very sad. It seems like there are more wolves among us 
than we ever expected. So seek the wolf in thyself!«»
«»
The mentioned happenings above has led us to do some changes in
this issue. We have obviously removed the «c6»Empty Minds «c7»section, but also the
«c6»Entertainment «c7»section. To replace them, we added the small «c6»Divina Commedia
«c7»section. Some other sections also suffer because of the missing support we
were promised.«»
«»
Despite of all these sad things, we won't disappoint all the sceners that
have given an overwhelming response to the last issue of «c6»D.I.S.C. «c7»We THANK
you all for the positive feedback given to us in nice emails and
snailmails. And in just ONE issue released in 6 years, you have voted us as
the third best digital magazine. Again we're more than pleased, and as a
big THANKS to you ALL we present you «c6»D.I.S.C. Issue 12! «c7»Therefore we come back
once again to give YOU dear reader the best «c6»Digitial Information Service a
Computerfreak «c7»can get! We bring you HOT news and ALOT of totally updated
articles about everything going on in our precious scene.«»

The last year has been an incredible year for the scene. It's once again
rising towards new heights! We have had several successful parties, with more
quality releases than we ever expected. Demos such
as «c6»Lapsuus, Perfect Circle, HotStyle Takeover, Cruel Karma Forms, Adam
Malysz, Amsterdam Blessings «c7»and several others speak for themselves. In
addition to the massive performance at the «c6»Mekka-Symposium «c7»with amazingly
20 demos, about 30 other demos got released last year at various
other parties. But also some incredible intros got released, both
small and big. «c6»Zeon, Option, 1 Week, Paradize, Dolphin Dreams, Melba «c7»and
«c6»Choke «c7»have to be mentioned
among them, in addition to «c6»Humus2, Boom, FogRoom «c7»and «c6»King Of Fuck.
«c7»The first 4k
musicdisk «c6»Brus «c7»was also released last year. Also the longawaited musicdisk
«c6»Kizz My Jazz «c7»should be mentioned, along with the cool slideshow «c6»The Puppets.
«c7»The packs continue getting released as well, and especially packs like «c6»Sabotage, 
FrozenPack, Speed, «c7»and «c6»Zosia «c7»deserve being mentioned here, in
addition to the new chippack trend with «c6»Noise From Heaven, ChipMunks, Save Da Vinyl, Embrion,
Liquidation «c7»and «c6»Psychol «c7»being the ones we expect more from.«»
«»
Amiga Inc also gives us some great news. So expect some new releases from
Amiga Inc and its partners the next months! This is the first amiga hardware
in ages!«»
«»
Of course we also have to mention a few words about the magscene. The
latest year also this area of the scene has risen again. We have had
releases of «c6»D.I.S.C, The EuroChart, ShowTime, Taboo, Jurassic Pack,
Devotion «c7»and «c6»Excess.
«c7»And some of
these issues are among the very best any of these mags have ever released.
2001 was a year with alot more mags being released than the previous years.«»
«»
As for «c6»D.I.S.C, «c7»we hope to give you the best digital mag there is nowadays!
After months of real hard work, we are pleased to offer you over 100
files and we have lots of illustrations to go with the various articles to
make them more interesting. In addition to the scene articles, we also offer a
«c6» «l:articles/last-bonusgallery»bonus-gallery«le» «c7»and a small «c6»
«l:articles/thecharts-charts»chart.«le»
«c7»We have a highly advanced code which makes it possible to include almost anything
in the articles. Therefore we have hidden many «c6»links «c7»to make it a bit more interesting.
As last time, we inserted various modules in the articles. And we also
have links to various other stuff. So just «c7»click «c6»on various words and
you'll never know what happens! ;)  «c7»We have also changed the code so that
«c6»D.I.S.C. «c7»is the first mag, to our knowledge, that theoretically can use up to 256 colours
cliparts! The code will be developed further and taken to new heights in
the next issues, as we have a very active mag coder.«»

Some great musicians are responsible for the music in this issue. The
first great module is called «c6»2 Falling Leaves «c7»and was composed by the king

delievered it to us under the name of «c6»«l:music/cruisin'thevortex.tp3»Cruisin' The Vortex.«le»

year, the cool musician «c6»Reed «c7»in cooperation with «c6»Tempest, «c7»and called
«c6»«l:music/sorryscortio.tp3»Sorry Scortio.«le» «c7»Do click on the
«c6» «l:articles/prefs»Prefs«le» «c7»to listen to all of these fabolous modules.«»

introduce who's left in the Main-Team of «c6»D.I.S.C. «c7»after the latest changes.
Anyway, the main-team consists of «c6»Darkhawk
«c7»and «c6»Zerox. «c7»Again «c6»Zerox «c7»was responsible for the
organizing, and the editing! Also «c6»Dr.Doom «c7»took part in the editing
this time,
in addition to making the code and the gfx! We had to stop him from not
making all the modules and articles as well!«»
«»
The «c6»D.I.S.C. Team «c7»also have a very small editor staff (after the latest
changes), which more or less will support «c6»D.I.S.C. «c7»in each issue.
The editors are; «c6»Powerslave «c7»and «c6»Punisher. «c7»As usual we have lots of guest
editors. In this issue the following persons contributed in one way or
another: «c6»Adonis, Bandy, Browalia, Curt Cool, Dire, Dran, Dreyer, Fishwave,
Kada, Krabob, Kure, Lahve, Loaderror, Malmis, Mr.Spiv, Podo, Scicco,
Shayera, Slummy, StingRay, Wade «c7»and probably some we can't remember right now.«»
«»
The news editor was «c6»Zerox, «c7»and the news agents were «c6»Azzaro, Da Freak, Kure, 
Lahve, Madbart, Hakon, Stunner «c7»and «c6»Scicco.«»
«»
«c7»The advertisements editor was «c7»Zerox.«»
«»
«c7»We also have to THANK «c6»Lahve «c7»for the pictures and all
groups with homepages... ;) and the active sceners which makes it possible
to release such a big project. It really takes alot of very special
and talented sceners to put together a project like this. And the «c6»D.I.S.C.
Team «c7»want to thank those who created and sustained it. We also want to
inform you that the official spreaders of «c6»D.I.S.C.
«c7»are: «c6»Adonis, Lahve, Powerslave «c7»and «c6»Punisher.«»
«»
«c7»In this issue we have some great articles as usual. The most interesting section
in «c6»D.I.S.C. «c7»is probably «c6»THE SCENE. «c7»We have tried to cover the active forces
of the scene, and espcially the demo scene. Therefore we present you the
latest group news and amiga news, reviews, scene-reports, party-reports,
the making of some productions and we also write about some interesting
groups and persons. We have also present lots of opinions by various
sceners, some gossip, the latest trends and lots more. So enjoy it all!«»
«»
For us to be able to come up with a great issue, the demo scene got to be
active. To have an entire mag filled with the usual editors about editors
articles are boring. So we depend on all of you out there to continue to
produce some «c6»great demos, intros, slideshows, musicdisks «c7»in addition to «c6»mags.
«c7»Last year has been fantastic, and hopefully many more quality productions
will come this year. The more releases
the better. We have to show everybody that the true Amiga scene is still
ALIVE and KICKING! Just as «c6»MatureFurk «c7»did at «c6»Assembly «c7»last summer!
Hopefully there will be held lots of more amazing parties, such as The
Mekka-Symposium, Trsac and Kindergarden to mention some. If we get the same
amount of releases at this years «c6»Mekka-Symposium party «c7»and the same
quality, it will be really great!«»
«»
At the end, we just want to wish you all a «c3»Happy New Year!«»
«»
«c7»With those words, we're ending this huge editorial. ENJOY issue 12 of
«c6»D.I.S.C.«»
