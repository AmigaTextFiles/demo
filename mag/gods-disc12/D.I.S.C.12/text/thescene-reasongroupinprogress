«as»«c7»The 4th of January 2000 a new group saw the light of day. It was «c6»Reason.
«c7»The group got founded by the Czech scener «c6»Subwork «c7»from the group Horizontal
Lamerz and the Yoguslavian coder & musician «c6»God Jr/I2K. «c7»Both stayed as
doublemembers of their other groups while trying to create this new team.
Subwork (swapper) is a scener which all of us know much better as «c6»Lahve!«»
«»
«c5»THE DEBUT«»
«»
«c7»Already the day after the founding of Reason some more talented members joined
the group. They were CX8X (graphician), Q_Plung (coder) and Zork (tracer) which
all joined as doublemembers from Iq2000. The 6th of January their first
production got released! It was a dentro called «c6»"Here We Are". «c7»The dentro
was coded by God Jr, which also did the music and some ideas were supplied
by Lahve. In any case, to release a dentro only two days after the founding
is quite impressive. The next week two members joined the Reason forces;
they were Factor6 and Genetix (both musicians).«»
«»
A month later on, the second production from Reason got out. It was the
«c6»announcetro «c7»for their planned mag «c6»OffWorld. «c7»The intro got some various
flame effects, like a flametunnel and flameobjects. The music is quite
crazy, hehe... Again it was done by God Jr in his typical way. He also did
the code, but the graphics and design were supplied by Cx8x.
Not many days later, more changes happened within Reason. A new member
joined, it was Darkus which joined as doublemember from Haujobb. And Zork
was kicked out due to inactivity. On the 26th of February Lahve finally
changed his handle for the last time, and has kept it until now.«»
«»
The next month the musician Deff Bro joined, and Reason also released a
«c6»party invitation «c7»for their Apocalypse party together with Horizontal
Lamerz. But that was not all, before the end of March, Reason also released
an «c6»announcetro «c7»for the pack «c6»Sabotage «c7»under the Horizontal Lamerz label.
It's just a very small intro with some text displayed over a moving
greytone background. And last in March, Darkus left them.«»
«»
Only a few days later the graphician Malmis joined from Apathy and Void as
a triple member. And also the swapper Makak joined as doublemember from
Terror 13 and last Fob (graphician) joined.«»
«»
Also May would proove to be a month full of events for Reason. The 1st of May
they released their first demo called «c6»Rage Against The Female «c7»at the
Apocalypse 2k party. It's actually a 7mb demo with a story.
And the next weeks many new members joined their
forces, like Asarhad (graphician) as triplemember from Corrosion and Bullshit
Artists, Hypnotic (3d artist) as triplemember from Oxygen and Cefalon, and
last Zito (swapper/editor) joined as triplemember from Darkage and Layout.«»
«»
«c5»THE RISE«»
«»
«c7»In the very beginning of June, Reason released a 64k intro called «c6»RazorBack
«c7»in the compo at the FuckYa'2k party, and won! The intro is being displayed
mostly in grey colours, and have an object flying inbetween some walls,
some fast objects shown over a moving background, some blurred linevectors
etc. The code was done by Godjr, graphics by Cx8x & Fob, and music by Lcr.«»
«»
Not much happened within Reason the next months, not until the middle of
August when Genetix left them but Lcr (musician) joined. At the very end of
the month Lahve decided to leave Horizontal Lamerz and join Madwizards as a
doublemember instead. A month later he also joined the ascii crew Layout.«»
«»
At the end of October, issue 5 of «c6»Sabotage «c7»got released. This was the first
Sabotage under the Reason label. Almost a month later Q_Plung got kicked
due to inactivity. And the 1st of December, «c6»Sabotage «c7»issue 6 got out as
well.«»
«c5»THE YEAR 2001«»
«»
«c7»The first thing that offically happened in 2001, was that Ham (coder &
musician) joined as doublemember from Software Failure. And in the middle
of January also the seventh issue of their «c6»Sabotage «c7»mag got released.«»
«»
In March the musician Lcr left the scene and Reason. And rumours were
indicating that their main coder God jr had become inactive. But not all
was bad, «c6»Sabotage «c7»issue 8 got released the same month. Anyway, the next
months the founder Lahve was a bit worried and had some thoughts about
closing down the Reason project. In May the graphician Malmis left for
Nature. But still, yet another issue of «c6»Sabotage «c7»got out.«»
«»
Then summer arrived, and it was good for the Reason crew which got new
energy. Ham did his first production for Reason, a 4k intro called «c6»Proton,
«c7»which got released at the Euskal 9 party. Tripper, a musician and swapper,
joined in early August and in the middle of the month, the coder Kufa
joined. In the very last days of the month, Uphold the Law, became the WHQ
BBS of Reason and finally «c6»Sabotage «c7»issue 10 got released. You can read more
about that issue in the review presented here in D.I.S.C.«»
«»
Anyway, Reason also released an ascii-colly done by Zito. In September Reason
together with Horizontal Lamerz also organized the Apocalypse party again.«»
«»
In the very end of September/beginning of October, Lahve left Madwizards to
join Scoopex as a doublemember instead. And also "Kufa" has joined Scoopex
as a doublemember to help building up the old legend Scoopex. Just like
some members from other crews, like StingRay for instance.«»
«»
In the last month of 2001, Reason released their «c6»Sabotage Pack issue 11.
«c7»You can read the review of it elsewhere in D.I.S.C.«»
«»
The last thing that happened with Reason in 2001 was that Lcr rejoined the
scene and Reason.«»
«»
«c5»THE FUTURE«»
«»
«c7»We have certainly not heard the last from this "newly" formed crew, and
will definately get to see more issues of «c6»Sabotage. «c7»Also various other
projects have been announced, not only intros/demos... so look out for
that! This very international group has more to offer!«»
