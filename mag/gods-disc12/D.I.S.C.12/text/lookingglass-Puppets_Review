«as»«c7»Here's a review of the slideshow called The Puppets by IRIS featuring the
Polish graphician «c6»Yon.«»

«c7»Size:         «c6»8.775 Mb«»

«as»The Puppets by IRIS «c7»is something so rare as a slideshow. And as different
from so many other slideshows in the past, there's actually «c6»a theme «c7»in The
Puppets which I'll come back to later on in this small review.«»
«»
The slideshow got «c6»19 screens «c7»with various images I guess, and out of them
15 ordinary pictures. The slideshow starts off by showing an IRIS logo over
a picture, a simple presents logo appears next and The Puppets
logo over a nice picture of a BIG eye catches our attention. I'm at once
thinking of the old phrase: «c6»The Masters Of Puppets «c7»(also a Metallica album
from 1986) is pulling your strings. Anyway, after a few seconds the menu
come to sight. It's very nice and could be described as "toys" laying in a
circle over some wodden table or floor. Every toy is a symbol of each
picture we can choose to watch. In the middle of the circle there's a nail
also. If you press on it, an autoslide appears. In the menu there are 14
toys, which means there are 14 pictures. But there's also a "hidden"
picture which you can access by pressing on the image in the upper left of
the menu. If you choose the autoslide the picture will appear anyway.
Apart from that, there's also a small paper you can click on in the upper
left of the menu, and then the credits page will appear. In addition to
this, there are also a couple of well hidden pictures.«»
«»
The «c6»code «c7»is fully system friendly and it multitasks. By pressing on
the button at the very top of the right corner, you can easily use other
prgrams while watching the slideshow. Just like I'm doing at the moment for
instance. By clicking on the button on the top of the left corner, you exit
the mag entirely. But that's not an option, is it? However, there are some
more options before you actually run the slideshow. There are two command
line options available for tweaking the sound. You can write ThePuppets.exe
nosound to better the speed for instance, or mixing the rate between
better sound or better speed. You just write ThePuppets.exe freq = 20.000
for instance. Higher number for better sound, and decrease it for better
speed.«»
«»
All the «c6»pictures «c7»are said to be original pictures, except from
one: The Three. It also seems like none of the pictures are truly done in
the old pixel-art style, but the creator Yon tells us that two of the
pictures are 100% pixelled. All pictures are also displayed in hires lace,
even the very few done in lowres originally.«»
Lets look a bit closer at the pictures then, using the placement of the
autoslide.«»
«»
First we get to see the «c6»credits. «c7»The people creating this slideshow are
refered to as the Masters. The graphics, is as said above, done by Yon.
The music by Nutman, and the code by Ransom. The credits page is by the way
nicely done, and the credits are kinda written on a piece of paper. The
page really reveal lots of things, but I guess the hanging man on the
right side fast catches our attention. Already now, the slideshow
indicates the depressive atmosphere.«»
«»
Then the first real picture is being displayed. The picture is called
«c6»Farewell. «c7»We get to see the back of a person sitting and looking out at
an empty city. Even the birds are flying away. It's like the person is
taking a last look at the city before leaving. At the right there's
a flower...«»
«»
The second picture is called «c6»Dragon Logo, «c7»and shows some scared people at
the right side of the picture. Perhaps their afraid of the Dragon?«»
«»
The next picture is called «c6»Death Flower. «c7»It's a big picture of a girl and a
flower made in a very special and nice style. Just look at the girls coat
for instance.«»
«»
Then we get to see a picture named «c6»The Three. «c7»It's a picture of a man with
a knife standing next to a very nicely made tree. The man looks like the
"death" coming to get you... «»
«»
The fifth picture is called «c6»The Last Day On Earth, «c7»and shows a man hanging
on a round stone circle. He's sourrounded by animals, taken from the
masters of puppets. It reminds me a bit of some old occult rituals.«»
«»
After that, we get to watch a picture named «c6»The Dragons. «c7»It's certainly a
very expressive and depressive picture. It's like looking death in the
eyes, and it also features some dragons in the background. It's pure art
and would fit as a painting.«»
«»
The seventh picture is called «c6»The Stone, «c7»and display a guy hanging on to life
perhaps? It's also quite depressive as all pictures. But the proportions of
the hands of this man look quite strange.«»
«»
Then next image is named «c6»The Born, «c7»and is really a great landscape picture.
It's like after a disaster has struck. The picture really offers alot of
nice details.«»
«»
The ninth picture is called «c6»IRIS. «c7»Some people will probably recognize this
picture from the demo Abecedarian released at Trsac2. For me, the picture
shows an angel.«»
«»
The next out is a picture called «c6»An Elf, «c7»and it shows an elf. Anyway, this
is not the best picture in this slideshow.«»
«»
After that, a picture named «c6»The Shadow «c7»is being displayed. It's again like
deadman walking. The picture reveals some very nice details, and it's
really good.«»
«»
The 12th picture in this slideshow, is called «c6»Makuleth. «c7»It shows a naked
woman in front of a chair, some polluting fabrics etc. Again it's quite a
strong symbol.«»
«»
Then we get to see a picture with the name «c6»The Picture. «c7»We get to see a
girl on the ground with fabrics in the background and birds flying away.«»
«»
The last picture in this slideshow is called «c6»The Web. «c7»It's a simple picture
probably made in lowres and changed into highres lace.«»
«»
«»
Probably none of the pictures in this slideshow would manage to win any big
graphics competition, but that doesn't mean that the slideshow ain't good.
Infact, I would say that the slideshow is a very good slideshow
which should do very good on the various charts. As I wrote in the
beginning of my review, this slideshow is quite different than most of the
other slideshows released because it got an overall theme. And about all
pictures fit into this style. The Puppets could be described as a «c6»very dark
and atmospheric slide. «c7»It got really ALOT of expression, and the pictures
reveal «c7»death, destruction and despair. «c7»But perhaps the flowers shown in
various pictures are a symbol of life and hope? We must not forget to
mention the great soundtrack called «c6»Dying «c7»which not only fits perfectly
into this slideshow, but also strengthen the dark atmosphere of The Puppets.
It's said to have been made in Digibooster 2.18 and converted into XM
format.«»
«»
The code is more than good enough to show these pictures, and it's
especially nice that the slideshow multitasks. However, the negative part
is that the fading of the pictures is real slow on my machine. But then
again, my cpu is slower than a fish swimming through jelly. Also the
pointer moves a bit slow on my configuration though.«»
«»
Other things that might be a bit negative, is that the placements of the
pictures in the menu, compared to the autoslide, is different. And obviously
this is NOT a pixel-art slideshow. The pictures are real HUGE and that's
also the reason why «c6»the slideshow is nearly 9mb of size! «c7»Just as a
comparison I have to mention that the latest Gods slideshow Divine released
in 2000, is 700kb all in all. Apart from that, there are only positive
things to say about the Puppets. It's quite unique really with it's theme
going through all aspects of the slide. It's not just a collection of
pictures put hastly together with no meaning at all. And the pictures in
this slideshow also display the very very special style of the «c6»graphician
Yon. «c7»A graphician I'm sure we'll get to hear ALOT more from in the future.«»
«»
So if you haven't already downloaded The Puppets yet, then I assure you it's
worth it. So what are you waiting for? This is definately a slideshow for
the «c6»top of the charts...«»
«»
«c6»In this destructive, hopeless and depressive atmosphere, «c7»and since I'm
quite depressed myself these days, I'd like to add a poem at the end of my
strange review! It's called «c6»Death Is Not The End and done by Special Rider.«»
«»
«c7»"When you're sad and when you're lonely«»

Not the end, not the end«»
Just remember that death is not the end«»

And heavy rains descend«»
Just remember that death is not the end«»
«»
And there is no-one there to comfort you«»
With a helping hand to lend«»
Just remember that death is not the end«»
Not the end, not the end«»
Just remember that death is not the end«»
