«as»
«c7»The last meeting several years ago had ended with «c6»Ghandy, Lord Helmet,
Sixpack and Zerox «c7»shaking eachothers hands and wishing
eachother luck before leaving in a flurry of promises for endless co-operation
and a soon recovery for D.I.S.C.!«»
«»
But the problems for the «c6»main team of D.I.S.C. «c7»and the rest of the team had
not ended with that meeting.
Infact, at the end of 1998 the prospect for success wasn't very promising
at all. It was impossible to get in touch with the coder «c6»Brainwasher «c7»as he
had left the scene to concentrate on his own company. Again the D.I.S.C. Team
was without a source and a coder. They were «c6»destroyed, «c7»and really began to
doubt D.I.S.C. would ever see the light of day again.«»
«»
However, in early 1999 a miracle happened; «c6»Modem «c7»agreed to code D.I.S.C!
The D.I.S.C. Team was again given new hope. Later on that year it seemed
like Modem didn't have time to code the mag afterall, so he gave the
«c6»precious mission «c7»over to a young coder named «c6»Cupid. «c7»These days he's better
known as «c6»Dr.Doom. «c7»Around the summer of 2000, Dr.Doom was able to present a
fully working source. It was a bit different from the earlier D.I.S.C.
sources, and «c6»quite unique «c7»in its way.«»
«»
It was time to send out invitations to all the D.I.S.C. Team members,
and also the main-team of D.I.S.C. of course. Yes, it was made certain to
invitate the powerful main-team as well as all the other supporters to a
«c6»banquet «c7»where the future of D.I.S.C. once again should be discussed.«»
«»
One of the main-team members, «c6»Sixpack, «c7»didn't reply to the invitation,
so from now on the main-team of D.I.S.C. was reduced to 3 members.
As the banquet began in the «c6»D.I.S.C. H.Q. building, «c7»also the eating started
with the arrival of the first tureens of soup. There were various soups to
choose between, some even with mushrooms, great platters of bread hot from
the ovens, and for those who thought soup was too thin without something
floating in it, dishes of dumplings and buckwheat noodles. «c6»Zerox «c7»drank his
soup thoughtfully, not really appreciating its plendid flavour, for once
again his attention was elsewhere. Were the other «c6»D.I.S.C. Team «c7»members
really dedicated, he thought. Finally the soup was cleared away and the
feasting progressed to more solid fare: poultry, fish and game of all
sorts, various sausages, buckwheat, pickled cucumbers, cabbage, great
joints of beef with sour cream, and succulent pieces of pork for those that
wanted.«»
«»
As usual at all of the «c6»D.I.S.C. team «c7»meetings, there were brisk discussions
amongst the members, not about the meat, but about the future. "It's time
to strenghten the D.I.S.C. team", «c6»Zerox «c7»said. "I agree" «c6»Lord Helmet «c7»added.
"But where to find new talents nowadays" «c6»Ghandy «c7»asked. "Why get new
members, when we just can promote one of the old co-editors?" «c6»Zerox
«c7»expressed. "Is that really an option?" «c6»Ghandy «c7»answered. "Who are you
thinking about«c6» Zerox?" Lord Helmet «c7»asked. "«c6»Darkhawk", Zerox «c7»said. "Why
not?", «c6»Lord Helmet «c7»added. "Ok, lets ask «c6»Darkhawk «c7»if he wants the job or
not. Any objections?" «c6»Zerox «c7»asked. This time there were no objections,
either voiced or silent. As with the first edge of all the visitors
appetities blunted by the good soups that began the meal, everyone else in
the building had found the time to talk as well. «c6»Zerox «c7»found «c6»Darkhawk «c7»and
asked him to join the main-team of D.I.S.C, and «c6»Darkhawk «c7»agreed. So now the
«c6»main-team of D.I.S.C. «c7»had once again 4 members. The banquet ended, and it
was time for the new main-team of D.I.S.C. to begin the work.«»
«»
Even though the new team looked very strong and impressive, it wasn't
really. The great «c6»Lord Helmet «c7»began to tire, and was not much into the
scene. «c6»Ghandy, «c7»which also had promised endless co-operation, didn't really
believe in the project at all. And «c6»Darkhawk «c7»was now also busy with another
magproject. It was only «c6»Zerox «c7»left which wasn't totally into other projects
as well. He had sweared to be loyal to the D.I.S.C. team many many years
ago, and intended to «c6»keep his promises.«»
«»
«c7»Hours became days, the days became weeks and the snow of winter began to
fall, covering the grass and the flowers and the dead leaves of autumn,
until all was still and silent and a shroud of white lay across the gardens
of the «c6»D.I.S.C. HQ building. «c7»It was about time to release a new issue of
D.I.S.C. after nearly 6 years of silence! «c6»Zerox «c7»was trying to learn how to
operate the new source while also gathering lots of support; like new gfx,
modules and intro, in addition to the contents. He also tried to write ALOT
himself. «c6»Lord Helmet «c7»was out of the scene, but agreed to make a few
cooperation articles with «c6»Zerox. Darkhawk «c7»made many articles also, and
delivered them all to «c6»Zerox «c7»to be edited into the source. Late, but still,
«c6»Ghandy «c7»also delivered articles so that D.I.S.C. could become reality.«»
«»
So in January 2001, a new issue of D.I.S.C. got released. It was «c6»issue 11. «c7»The
sceners really liked it, so the hard work and the continuous believe in the
project had finally paid off. At least it appearantly looked like that,
«c6»D.I.S.C had risen «c7»up to the third place at the charts with only ONE release
in 6 years.«»
«»
Far from everything was allright. The last issue of D.I.S.C. was HUGE, but
not perfect. There were some outdated files and the final editing could
have been better. But the real trouble had just started...«»
«»
The months passed by, and nothing at all happened. «c6»Lord Helmet «c7»wasn't that
interested in the scene anymore, and besides, he was busy working and being
a father. So he was no longer a part of the D.I.S.C. team.
«c6»Ghandy «c7»was working on Showtime, and in secrecy also with «c6»Jurassic
Pack. «c7»And «c6»Darkhawk «c7»was busy with the EuroChart. So D.I.S.C. wasn't the
first priority at all. But finally a releasedate was decided, and a final
deadline set.«»
«»
«c6»Zerox, «c7»being the only one without any other projects on the side, took on
the job to organize it again. And the coder, «c6»Dr.Doom, «c7»wanted to get more
involved in the project and volunteered to do the editing. And so the
making of the new issue began. New ideas were created, and it was just a
matter of fulfilling them.«»
«»
Modules were collected, along with an intro. A few external files were all
they managed to get. It seemed like not all were that dedicated to the
project afterall. And then it was clear that «c6»Ghandy «c7»didn't want to support
the mag despite of all his past promises. «c6»Zerox «c7»was devistated. All
these years with the struggle to get D.I.S.C. back seemed to be wasted.
The dream had vanished. Nothing was left. Nothing. «c6»Zerox «c7»could barely get
enough strenght to breathe in or out. His legs wobbled beneath him, but
they had been wobbling for so long that when they finally collapsed, he
wasn't certained if it was because his legs gave out or because of other
reasons. «c6»Zerox «c7»felt betrayed, betrayed by a person he thought was a good
friend which shared his dreams. He was mistaken.«»
«»
These setbacks just before the release of D.I.S.C caused some problems. The
main-team of D.I.S.C. was suddenly reduced to two persons! Now only
«c6»Darkhawk and Zerox «c7»were left. «c6»Zerox «c7»did his part with writing as much as he
could the last days before the release which was planned to be at the Trsac
party. But due to various reasons, it was simply impossible to release the
mag there. Then «c6»Dr.Doom «c7»couldn't finish the editing job afterall, but still
managed to improve the source. And now as «c6»Darkhawk and Dr.Doom «c7»have done hard
work as well, and the editing job returned to «c6»Zerox, «c7»the result was «c6»issue 12.«»
«»
«c7»If there will be released another issue of D.I.S.C. is yet to be seen
though as «c6»Zerox «c7»went into a depression because of the deceive from his
friend «c6»Ghandy. «c7»And none heard from him for months. And «c6»Darkhawk «c7»was busy doing
some issues of the EuroChart...«»
«»
If the scene itself has reached autumn, «c6»D.I.S.C. has reached winter. «c7»But do
go out in winter and watch the drifting snow. See, always, how they blow
and swirl, apart and then together. It might be nothing but the wind. Or
then again, it might be the ashes of old D.I.S.C. trying to become whole
once again. But know this, for your comfort when the shadows grow dark and
lenghthen towards night... «c6»D.I.S.C. is not dead.... «c7»not yet.«»
