«as»«c7»From the beginning of the amiga scene and until today, there have probably
been «c6»thousands of musicians. «c7»And there have been even more that have fooled
around with «c6»Soundtracker, Noisetracker, Protracker «c7»and other trackers. The
scene have been able to hear modules from alot of talented musicians.
But only a few of these have managed to «c6»release their own CDs.
«c7»However, in the past at least some famous sceners have released some CDs,
like «c6»Lizardking, Jester, Jogeir, Scorpik and Moby «c7»for instance. Unfortunately, even less
sceners have dared to pursuit a career as musician. This is quite bad as
I'm sure many more are talented enough to be a professional musician.«»
In any case, a few new CDs from sceners and ex.sceners have been released the latest
months. Yes, «c6»Dr.Awesome/Crusaders, Powl/Bonzai-Revival, Marc/Haujobb &
Sector 7 and Maze/Apathy managed «c7»to release some more CDs.«»
«»
While «c6»Dr.Awesome «c7»has released alot of CDs in the past, «c6»Powl «c7»made his debut
this January. «c6»Marc «c7»has also released many Cds in the past and got his music
published. He has also performed live in concerts. «c6»Maze «c7»released his first
CD album last year, but had released a CD single previously.«»
«»
It was earlier this month «c6»Bonzai-Revival «c7»announced that their member «c6»Powl
«c7»had released his debut CD called «c6»Tracked. «c7»It's possible to get a copy of
the CD in cd audio, mp3, fast tracker or xm format by sending an email to
promo@powl-music.com. More info can probably be found at
«c6»www.bonzai-revival.de«»

«c7»In December last year «c6»Dr.Awesome, «c7»known for being one of the first
main-editors of the EuroChart back in 1989, released yet another CD. These
days Dr.Awesome is probably even more known as «c6»Bj0rn Lynne. «c7»He has managed
to get a good name in the game music business in addition to releasing
many various CDs, both own made and by the help of record companies.«»
«»
Some people will probably remember at least some of the following CDs from
Bj0rn Lynne aka Dr.Awesome aka Divinorum. He has released titles as
«c6»Witchwood, The Void, Wizards of the Winds, Wolves of the Gods, Revive,
The Gods Awaken, Alien Breed 3D Soundtrack, Decade, Seven Kingdoms
Soundtrack, Phoenix: Deep Space Resurrection, Isms, Talisman «c7»and, his
latest CD is called «c6»Accelerator!«»
«»
Accelerator «c7»is described to be quite different from Lynnes recent albums.
It's more upbeat, positive, driving rock, funk & dance music which someone
certainly will remember as the old style of Dr.Awesome. The CD is also
entirely done by himself without any record company and got 12 tracks,
which are:«»
«»
«c6»01. Turbo Grid«»
02. Play Dirty«»
03. Tunnelvision«»
04. Palm Freak«»
05. Alley Kat«»
06. Accelerator«»
07. Road Hog«»
08. Trippin' High«»
09. The Hustler«»
10. Stunt Grand Prix«»
11. Bump & Grind«»
12. Monkey See Monkey Do«»
«»
«c7»Bj0rn Lynne himself describes many of the tracks above to be in the «c6»"borderland
between melodic rock, funk and dance. Palm Freak and The Hustler send a nod to the
classic Outrun music, Trippin' High stays firmly in Drum'n Bass land and tracks
like Turbo Grid is just all-out rock with no stops pulled and features the
awesome Marc Pattison on guest guitar. Then there is Play Dirty which is a butt
twisting 70's style funk rock track". «c7»So what are you waiting for? The CD
can be ordered at «c6»www.lynnemusic.com«»
