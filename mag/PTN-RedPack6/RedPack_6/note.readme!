         Hi all!

Sorry, but due to the lack of time, the code in some parts of this pack is
very lame, so there is huge mainfile and some bugs left.  It also requires
a  lot  of  chip-mem,  so  probably  you  will  have  to  run this without
startup-sequence.   I  think  that  there  is problem when DOpus is active
(memory  isn't  restored  after quit), but I'm not using this tool, so I'm
not 100% sure if it's its fault.

Feel free to write to me on my snail-mail, or e-mail (tomba@friko.onet.pl)
for  bugreports,  or  just  for  msx^asm  swapp.  Answer for everybody, of
course.

                                                  yours, tomba.potion
