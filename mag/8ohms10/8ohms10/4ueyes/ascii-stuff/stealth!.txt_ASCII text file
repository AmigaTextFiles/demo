@BEGIN_FILE_ID.DIZI sugggest you read this.
Check out your friends.
They may not be who you think they are.
Backstabbing is in full force, as u c.
--------------------------------------------
I got this, had to spread it. How sad can
you get? People actually speak their minds
and get dissed by nobodies. Grow up!
Python sucks dick for talking about things
that he will *NEVER* understand!
--------------------------------------------
@END_FILE_ID.DIZ


----------------------------------------
So, I log onto #Amigaexotic as [P]ython, and couldn't fucking believe
what I was reading there. I couldn't get my buffercleaner to work, so
this is a little hard to read. Try anyway.

So, the scene is where friendship counts?
Are you fuckin' shittin' me?

Backstabbing cunts like these destroyed that.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a note from someone who actually cares about the scene ... it may be worth
considering the words written below because they make a lot of sense. If you
are what might be deemed a "new boy" on the scene then maybe you haven't
called Digital Candy before, but keep in mind it's been around for a number
of years and the people responsible for bringing you this board have
forgotten more than you will ever know ...

The bloke who snapped and spread this text is in need of serious psychiatric
evaluation. If he was ever a user of the original Digital Candy then he would
note (purely for reference of course) that the new DC is nowhere near the
quality of the old one and that is for one reason only. The new one is full
of lamers. Grow up people or lose your boards.
