                               ------ ---

A CHEESE BOX (NAMED FOR THE TYPE OF BOX THE FIRST ONE WAS FOUND IN) IS A
TYPE OF BOX WHICH WILL, IN EFFECT, MAKE YOUR TELEPHONE A PAY-PHONE.....THIS IS
A SIMPLE, MODERNIZED, AND EASY WAY OF DOING IT.
 
INSIDE INFO:  THESE WERE FIRST USED BY BOOKIES MANY YEARS AGO AS A WAY OF
MAKING CALLS TO PEOPLE WITHOUT BEING CALLED BY THE COPS OR HAVING THEIR
NUMBERS TRACED AND/OR TAPPED.

            INGREDIENTS:
            ------------
1  CALL FORWARDING SERVICE ON THE LINE
1  SET OF RED BOX TONES
 
THE NUMBER TO YOUR PREFIX'S INTERCEPT OPERATOR (DO SOME SCANNING FOR THIS ONE)
 
 
              HOW TO:
              -------
 
     AFTER YOU FIND THE NUMBER TO THE INTERCEPT OPERATOR IN YOUR PREFIX,
USE YOUR CALL-FORWARDING AND FORWARD ALL CALLS TO HER. THIS WILL MAKE YOUR
PHONE STAY OFF THE HOOK (ACTUALLY, NOW IT WAITS FOR A QUARTER TO BE DROPPED
IN). YOU NOW HAVE A CHEESE BOX...IN ORDER TO CALL OUT ON THIS LINE:YOU MUST
USE YOUR RED BOX TONES AND GENERATE THE QUARTER DROPPING IN. THEN, YOU CAN
MAKE PHONE CALLS TO PEOPLE! AS FAR AS I KNOW, THIS IS FAIRLY SAFE, AND THEY
DO NOT CHECK MUCH... ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SURE, I THINK YOU CAN EVEN MAKE
LONG DISTANCE CALLS.
