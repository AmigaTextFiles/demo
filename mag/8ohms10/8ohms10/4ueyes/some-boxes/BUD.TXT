               Budbox

This is a portable unit. "It is
extremly handy for free voice calls
and tapping a near by house's line.
It's really easy to make so don't
worry about it (unlike a blue box!).

Materials required to build the Bud Box
========= ======== == ===== === === ===

(2) alligator clips
(1) one peice fone or (1) normal fone
    (one peice is easier.)
some good wire
(1) soldering iron
some solder

Contruction of the Bud Box:
=========== == === === ====

1)  Cut the wire that connects the
fone to the wall. Inside there should
be 4 colored wires. Yellow, red,
green, and black. If the wire are not
colored, no need to get worried. The
two in the middle are red reen.
Those are the two you need.

2)  Make sure to keep about 1-2 feet
of this wire connected to the fone
unless you want to use the other wire
listed above. Now solder one alligator
clip to the green wire, and one the
red.

3)  If you're using the other wire,
strip the ends and solder oe it goes off leaving you in
the clear
 
genuine fun:
------------
find a good road in your neighborhood
or somewhere else where only one car
will be going by at a time....if the
road is too busy this won't work...
now take some fish line and get enough
to stretch across the road and clear 
it on both sides by 2-3 feet....you
must also find a place with mail boxes
or electric boxes across the road from
each other....now tie the fish line to
two of the liter bottles on each side
...the idea is to set the line up so
it will be just above fender level
you must also make sure that while the
bottles will not fall over that the 
will come off when a car passes....
after a car passes watch and see how 
far your little present stays with
them...coffee can may be preferred
because they produce a more pleasing
effect to the ears when dragging 
behing the victim...also don't stand
too close to the line incase you 
catch an ulikely jogger
 
also did you ever believe in santa as
a kid...well we have a new variation
on chimney suprises...just go by the
nearest supermarket and obtain (how
ever you want) a watermelon...
decorating the watermelon is optional
becuase it is likely that the
decorations will be messed up during
action.....anywayz now for
hard part....in some way climb up to
the top of their chimney and drop the
water melon down their chimney...if 
there is one of those damn grates on
top take it home for a souvenir
 
ever seen those luminaria things
around christmas time?...well this
idea can be used at the same time as
the fake santa to create a real
feeling of christmas and 'gift'-giving
ok now....take that ample supply of
shit and fill some little paper bags
(about 4)...then spray it with gas
and leave your 'gift' on someone's
porch  and light the bag....then ring
the door..haul ass...and watch to see
if the person is in a christmassy
spirit....by the way watch to see if
they try and stomp it out...that's
messy eh?
