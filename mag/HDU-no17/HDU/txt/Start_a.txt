Startup Alpha - Startup-Sequence selector

This program was made for my own use to allow me to use 
multiple startup-sequences, it is not designed to make your coffee 
or have your children it just does startup's, and i made it because 
most of the other Startup-selectors do too much for their own 
good.


What you need - startup Alpha needs
** OS 2.04+
** Some startup-sequences (Duh)
** Gadtools library (i dont know what the min vers is)
** A Left shift key (Well they do brake)
** Some memory (512K SHOULD be alright)
