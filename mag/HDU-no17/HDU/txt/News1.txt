News - February '99
=============================================

=============================================
Naplm Update
=============================================
Just a small update to mention that it has been announced on the 
clickBOOM site that Napalm, will after all, contain some sort of 
network support. As promised, Serial support will be included with 
the game at release time, however, the major news is that there may 
be some sort of TCP/IP support added in the future. 

This is excellent news as the Amiga still lacks a decent multi-player 
TCP game, obviously, there is Quake, but this is limited by the lack 
of a Quakeworld add-on that would greatly improve the game in this 
respect. 

As for the release of Napalm, it shouldn't be that far away now, 
maybe even within the next few weeks. 

============================================
Final MoonBases Demo Released
============================================

Kinda old news now, although I'd thought i'd mention it. The final 
demos of the strategy game, Moonbases have been released. 
The demo is available in two forms, one for AGA and another for 
GFX cards. Both are available from Aminet. 

=============================================
Starfighter
=============================================

Just to let you folks know, this game is still alive and will hopefully be 
coming our way soon. It will be published by Epic Marketing and is 
scheduled for a release sometime in January. A new demo and 
webpage update are on the cards soon, look out for more news 
coming your way on this very soon. 

While on the subject, there are a few other games that are going to 
be coming from Geosync, again, I will have more news on these for 
you soon. 

=============================================
Digital Images go for Halflife
=============================================

Yep, thats the latest target for Digital Images. After very little success 
on the Quake 2 front, Digital images have now turned their attention 
to this stunning new release on the PC. If they can secure the 
license, it could mean big things for the Amiga. However, its going to 
take a hell of a lot of hard work on their front, and thats even if the 
developer of this game would even consider a port.

=============================================
Space Station 3000 
=============================================
SS3000 is Digital Images first game for the Amiga, the first of what is 
expected to be a remarkable line up of games from them. As the 
release of Space Station 3000 draws closer, it should be ready in 
March they have released some new screenshots. The most notable
is the Bridge of the Space Station, I'm not sure who the artist is but 
it's well done and lets hope the other in-game screenshots are as 
good as this one.

Here is some info to remind you what Space Station 3000 is all 
about - Space Station 3000 is about the management of a space 
station, it is the sequel to the original PD Space Station by Digital 
Images. The basic idea is to build a space station and equip it to 
defend yourself from anyone or anything that may attack it, with you 
having control over the space station and the people who dock with 
it. As far as defense of your station is concerned, you can buy 
weapons and defenses such as shield generators, fighter ships, 
battle cruisers and UFO's. A nice little feature is that once a enemy 
ship has been disabled, you can use the opportunity to board the 
ship and take it for yourself.

Researching is crucial for obtaining new equipment for the       
station, or new things to trade with when ships dock with your 
station. All you require is a science lab and a science officer, if you 
want to trade goods then a manufacturing plant is needed. To trade 
with ships they need to dock with the station and once they have 
docked you start earning money for they have to pay a docking 
charge, rent a room, and then trade with you. But they may not want 
to dock due to bad reputation, so it's important to stay out of 
constantly attacking ships.

The planet that your space station is in orbit over plays a role in 
whether your prospects will be good or bad. A rich planet like Earth,       
can make a lot of money from trading with people, but there won't be 
much in the way of fights because of the high security. The safer a 
planet is, the more money you are likely to make. Shops may rent 
out premises on the station, paying quite a bit but in a cheap star 
system the shop prospects won't be very good, neither will the 
money, but there will generally be plenty of fighting there. To go to 
another planet requires a hyper drive but permission needs to be 
granted to be in a planets orbit.

Space Station 3000 is in some ways like Theme Park and just like in 
Theme Park you'll need to have staff to keep the station running. If 
you don't have enough engineers then things will break down, not 
enough weapons officers then your station won't perform very well in 
battle. If crew get injured in battle you're going to need a hospital or 
they'll die.

Space Station 3000 will be CD-Rom only, requiring at least 2MB 
Fast Ram and 3MB Hard Disk space. Readers can now pre-order 
Space Station 3000 from Blittersoft by e-mailing them at:-

=============================================
The Last Seal.
=============================================

The Last Seal is a new adventure game in the Lucasarts style from a 
new developoment team called Ancor. 

The basis of the story behind the game goes something like this. In 
the time of the old Egyptians evil came to slay mankind, however, 
the Egyptian gods came to the rescue of mankind and took 
measures to make sure that it could never return. These measures 
where to banish it to and un-escapeable cage which where sealed 
with 5 seals. However, this was over 400 years ago and over time 
the seals have been removed, one by an archaeologist, 2 by 
gravehunters and one by a team os scientists, now there is only one 
seal keeping the evil inside. 

It is your job in this game to recover each of the 4 stolen seals and 
replace them back in their position and thus preventing evil 
escaping. However, you start the game in prison (seems the be the 
starting point for many games of this type and must escape and fight 
your way through many puzzles in your quest to find the 4 seals. 

The game boasts a number of nice features including uptp 5 different 
views in each room, raytraced backgrounds, 300+ frames of 
animation for the main character and over 150 for the second 
character, a number of action sequences, spoken in-game dialogue, 
raytraced video sequences and much more. 

Once nice feature that the game also includes is the ability to 
remove the command bar when not in use to make the game seem 
even more real. 

The game will work on AGA Amiga only (No Graphic card support 
sadly) with an 030 processor, 16Mb RAM and a CD-ROM drive. 

A release date is yet to be set.
