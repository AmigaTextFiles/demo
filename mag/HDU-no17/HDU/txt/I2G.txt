Index2Guide
============================================

Why was this program created?
Nowadays  AmiNet is important for all Amiga owners to share files 
through. With such a great shareware  base, however,  there are 
many files. With a Ftp-client  like  MuiFtp  by Michael Neuweiler 
you can easily choose among them in their divided drawers, but 
what happens if you don't have a wallet the size of Bill Gates' and 
can't stay online all day?

Then  you  can  examine  the  files at  home by downloading  the  
enormous indexfile from AmiNet. This file is pretty hard to handle 
and difficult tosearch in - and that's why Index2Guide were 
created!

Index2Guide  makes  an  easy to read .guide-file  out  of  the 
indexfile, which  can  be  read  by  any  program  that  supports 
the hypertext format AmigaGuide such as Multiview that comes 
with AmigaOS 3.0+.

In the created AmigaGuide file  you can click your  way through 
the drawers and  see  which  files  is  in  each  drawer -  which  is 
much easier  than examining the whole index at a time, and the 
guide-file gets smaller!

With  version  1.3  you can  convert  RECENT files to AmigaGuide 
format to.


What does this program require?
Well... first you got  to  have  an Amiga,  and that's about it! But if 
you would like to view result of this program  you must  have  a  
program  that supports the hypertext format AmigaGuide.

ie:  AmigaGuide or Multiview.

This  program  requires  a  lot of  memory. 2 * the  size of  the 
Indexfile you   are  converting   or 12 * the  Recent file  
(Recent-files are  small, though).  If you have problem with this,  
write to me,  and I will consider releasing a less memory-hungry 
version.
