Author: Fredrik Westermarck <fredrik.westermarck@mds.mdh.se>
============================================

PowerView is a JPEG-picture viewer for Amigas equipped with a 
PPC-accelerator. The JPEG conversion is based upon libjpeg 
(V6b) from the Independent JPEG Group.

The program is still in beta so there might still be serious bugs. If 
you use this program please report bugs/misfeatures to me.
