Abducted
=============================================

Aftertaste Productions is the latest development team to emerge 
into the games market offering Abducted, a new adventure in the 
style of Monkey Island and Simon the Sorcerer. Production of 
Abducted is coming along nicely with the initial screenshots 
showing plenty of potential.

The story to Abducted is set in 1734 in a small village called 
Pomperville. The lead character, Slugbert Cramfish is walking 
around the house, when there suddenly appears an UFO in the 
sky. He gets abducted by these crazy little alien dudes and spend 
the next ten years in outer space. Then he returns to his village to 
visit his family. But things have changed, people are frightened and 
after Slugbert has talked to some people, he finds out that a 
viscous, evil, tyrannical character by the name "Vassago" has 
taken over the city. He's a messenger from hell and is a devil. But 
he's actually an ordinary human being, only that the body is 
obsessed by the demon. This human happens to be Slugberts own      
father, which isn't good! The rest of his family has been turned into      
stone statues in Vassagos castle. Slugbert realises that he has to 
save his family and the village from this demon...

Currently Aftertaste Productions is continuing to work hard to 
complete Abducted but has no Publisher, so if you can sort them 
out, get in contact.

More Games From Digital Dreams Entertainment
=============================================

Diablo's Land is an arcade-adventure game featuring many FRP 
elements.  The storyline is set in the Land of Hastor that has fallen 
into dark and chaos with an evil force terrorizing the populace and 
the judgment day is approaching. The last hope is now depending 
on you.  You choose between a number of characters - a strong 
warrior and the brave and beautiful Amazon. You'll discover 
weapons, armor, and magical treasures, and develop your 
character's skills and abilities as you travel through the labyrinths. 
You can get a lot of help from the characters you'll meet on your 
journey, but it depends on your behaviour, will they become your 
friends or enemy's. Diablo's Land boasts digital speech and sound 
effects that will make the horrors of deep dungeons even more 
frightening as well as loads of 3D rendered graphics.

It will require Aga or an GFX card, 4MB Ram, a CD-Rom drive and 
be out in April. 

Their third game is MegaPolice and I would say the most 
interesting game idea, a real-time strategy game set in a police 
department. You are the Chief of the police department, in charge 
of keeping the streets safe and clean from the worst criminals in 
the city.  Either through negotiations or police actions you will need 
a lot of courage and skill to ensure peaceful and safe nights for the 
city, dealing with criminals, terrorists, drug dealers and thieves.

MegaPolice will feature more than 600MB of outstanding 3D 
graphics and audio effects with many thrilling actions taking place.

It will require Aga or an GFX card, 6MB Ram, a CD-Rom drive and 
be ready in the summer.

What Happened To Wasted Dreams?
=============================================

The development team behind Wasted Dreams, Digital FX 
Entertainment has financially collapsed going into bankruptcy.  
Digital Dreams Entertainment has therefore taken over the 
development of Wasted Dreams, a one of two player 
arcade-adventure renaming it, Distant Dreams but with little 
significant changes to the actual game.

The background to Distant Dreams reveals that Earth has gone 
through many changes since the multi-national companies took 
control for they have left 90% of the population unemployed 
generating poverty, toxic pollution and ever increasing crime levels. 
The only option left is to leave Earth in search of a new home.

A space mission called ExplorerFX2 is sent out to look for this 
refuge and you are on board as one of the crew. After 9 months of 
searching it seemed like a wasted dream for no new home was 
found. Then in the Geminorum a suitable planet was discovered 
and it was named Agillera. During the 6 month stay on Agillera a 
base camp was set up and exploration carried out but no intelligent 
life was found. It was decided that some of the crew would have to 
return to Earth to relay the exciting news and so you and a friend 
named Harper agreed to go with about 800 others. Shortly after 
you entered deep sleep there is an explosion, you wake along with 
Harper and escape into a shuttle abandoning ExplorerFX2 which is 
then destroyed. You wake up to find that your shuttle has crash 
landed back on Agillera but the situation has changed.

Distant Dreams will require at least Aga or an GFX card, 3MB 
Ram, and a CD-Drive and should be ready for release in January.  
They are currently looking for distributors for Distant Dreams and 
some other games.

Heretic For The Amiga
=============================================

Heretic: Shadow Of The Serpent Riders has made it to the Amiga, 
since its initial release on the PC in 1996. Raven Software only 
released the source to Heretic a few days ago with talented Amiga 
Gamers converting Heretic to the Amiga, allowing Amiga Gamers 
for the first time to experience this highly acclaimed Doom style 
game.

Heretic's story is set in a twisted medieval dimension, undead 
creatures and bestial horrors have done the unthinkable - callously 
slaughtering your entire race. Your friends. Your family.       
Eliminated. But the nightmare has just begun. Wielding ungodly 
weapons such as the Firemace and Hellstaff and casting spells 
from the Tomes of Power, you must seek your vengeance. Or die 
trying.

Information on features is scarce but I am aware that you can 
choose from among 7 weapons from the simple staff to the 
awesome Phoenix Rod or use arcane artifacts to unleash unearthly 
power on unsuspecting foes.

There are many different versions of Heretic being released so it is
impossible to provide exact requirements to play Heretic. Although 
you do require a certain WAD file to work inconjunction with the 
conversions.
