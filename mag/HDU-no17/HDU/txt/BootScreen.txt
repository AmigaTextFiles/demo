BOOTSCREEN
============================================
Startup screen program for Amigas with Workbench release 37 
(2.04) or higher. Copyright ©1994 by Joseph Luk. All rights 
reserved.

BootScreen 2.2 is now ShareWare.  Registration instructions are 
included at the bottom of each doc file.  The version that you have 
here is complete except it only contains one sample picture file -- I 
chose not to hand out crippled versions or annoying requesters in 
the hope that the Amiga community hasn't come to need them.  
You do get benefits by registering, and the least of them is the 
smaller executable size of the registered versions.  :>  Please 
read the main documentation and registration instructions for 
more information.
