This is the album of a friend. Heheheh Afreak, don't be afraid, you know already that I like Underneath so
I won't throw it in flames ;-)

<P>

Although it's the second album of the belgian band Uncle Meat, they like to say that it's their first
real album. Previous one ( Swallow ) was a kind a very good demo. They have in fact rerecorded 2
songs from Swallow on the next album.

<P>

For this CD, the band has been produced by Collin Richardson ( who wanted to produce them... It's surely
a sign ! ). You know, it's the guy responsible of the mighty sound of Fear Factory, Machine Head... It's
not a beginner !

<P>

But the music ??? Yes the music, let's speak about it... The band says they have lot's of influences from
bands of 80's : Sisters of Mercy, Depeche Mode... Quite diversified influences in fact. The result is
a powerfull music with use of samples, not purely metal.

<P>

Best songs of the album are ( for me ) :Turn Away, Underneath, 22 ( Very slow but very dark ) and Tangled
. But as I like always what others don't like, make yourself your own opinion.

<P>

My quote : 7.5/10
