<H1>Nine Inch Nails : The Story ( by Steven Degryse )</H1>

<IMG WIDTH=234 HEIGHT=333 SRC="images/nin1.gif" ALIGN="LEFT">

After months of silence, the new mini-album is here, filled with remixes of the song NIN made for the
David Lynch's movie "Lost Highway", for which Trent Reznor made and directed the soundtrack ( he
programmed the excellent german "Tanzmetal"-band RAMMSTEIN on the soundtrack, which meaned their big
international breakthrough ).<BR>
Soon will the new album follow, but awaiting that fact, we have to be happy with the NIN stuff we already
have : the "Perfect Drug" single, and the "Perfect Drug" mini-album.

<P>

In the meantime, the band after Trent Reznor, the actual NIN you might say, are working hard on their
side project "TAPEWORM" ( being produced by Trent ? ). Rumours say that the new NIN album will have
drum and bass influences, and will be more industrial than it originally was.

<P>

Trent also focusses on his producing and remixing career although he has only little time for those.
He has produced "Antichrist Superstar", the third album of MARYLIN MANSON, the MTV-industrial-gods, but
pretty woosies, and he has lots of offers from small ( ? ) industrial and electro bands, such as FRONT
LINE ASSEMBLY ( who's new commercialised but excellent album "Flavour Of The Weak" (OFF BEAT) is out
now ), DIE KRUPPS and many others.<BR>
He also runs his own label, featuring stars like COIL, MARYLIN MANSON and POP WILL EAT ITSELF.

<P>

<B>But what does the name Nine Inch Nails stand for ?</B>

<P>

<U>Trent Reznor</U> : "I don't know if you have ever tried to think of band names, but usually you think
of a great name and if you look at it the next day, it's stupid. I had about 200 of those. Nine Inch
Nails lasted the two weeks test, looked great in print and could ne abbreviated easily. It really doesn't
have any litteral meaning. It's seemed kind of frightening."

<P>

<B>And how did it really start, the band that influenced the whole industrial movement, who made it come out
of the underground and shock the daylight ?</B>

When Trent started, MIDI-equipment ( that combines computer with analogue or digital synthesizers ) wasn't
really around already. Trent wanted to become a comuter engineer but when he realized that it was more
calculus than creativity, he bailed out and started experimenting with early sequencing and MIDI.<BR>
He liked metal a lot and before knowing it, he was already in the frontline, making music such as SKINNY
PUPPY and MINISTRY were making.

<P>

The first Nine Inch ( 9" )single "Down In It" was an immediate hit but many industrial pioneers saw it as
a rip-off of SKINNY PUPPY"s "Dig It". Later, Trent admitted that the song was really influenced by that
song.<BR>
Little later, the first full CD, "Pretty Hate Machine" followed, featuring this song plus eight others.<BR>
In 1990, two other singles : "Head Like A Hole" and "Sin" were taken from the album, in 1992 the mini-CD
"Broken" appeared, followed by the remix album "Fixed", a procedure he also repeated with his 1994 album
"The Downward Spiral", who was followed by "Further Down The Spiral".

<P>

In 1996, he wrote the first video-game soundtrack ever for a PC game named "Quake".<BR>
In 1997, a Mexican artist went to trial with Trent for copyright-violations. The Mexican claimed to have
written "The Downward Spiral" and having sent it on a demo to Nothing Records, Trent's record company. Now
the Mexican bloke says that Reznor stole it all from him... No court decision yet.

<P>

Trent has contributed to a lot of movies until now : he has produced the soundtrack for Oliver Stone's
"Natural Born Killers" and for David Lynch's "Lost Highway".<BR>
The song "Gave Up" ( in the "Fixed" remix )was featured on the "Young Americans" movie, as well as "Head
Like A Hole" was featured in a movie named "Prayer Of The Roller Boys". "Dead Souls", a cover from JOY
DIVISION, was used in the legendary "The Crow" and the Precursor Remix of "Closer" is used during the
opening credits of 1997's chock-movie "Seven". Also "The Fan" features a lot of songs of NIN.<BR>
Trent Reznor also made a short film named "Broken" for the release of the "Broken" EP, together with Peter
Christopherson and looking like real snuff movie.

<P>

The Nine Inch Nails spiral never holds still, so by the time you read this, Trent and his freaky friends
will probably have changed something about their future.
