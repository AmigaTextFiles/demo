SYRENS CALL should not tells you something in musical area but it should not sooner remain like
that. It is in fact the new name chosen by the ex-SNAILBOOSTER.

<P>

The career of SNAILBOOSTER began early 90's with a classic but efficient Heavy Metal. The band,
composed of Greg Hasstrup (vocals, guitars), Sebasien paul ( drums, vocals ), Schmé ( bass ) and
Stéphan "Louis" Thuriot (guitar), edits in 1992 his first demo called "Guilty" which sold 200
copies.

<P>

The 5 titles of this demo will be reedited on the first album "Why" in 1994 and recorded in the same
studio.<BR> This albums contains 11 titles of pure mighty Heavy but always melodic. It has a good
production and the band decided to give it a big promotion. Those efforts paid well : good critics
in national press (Hard Force, Hard Rock) and other fanzines in different countries.

<P>

Follow several gigs in northern France and in Belgium. It will be the occasion to sell CD's but also
to be the support band for Tipsy Weet, Molodoï and even Ellis, russian FM Hard Rock band on european
tour.

<P>

In september 1995, Greg leaves the band which will find soon a young solo player (17 years old)
Yann Stefani and a female singer Valérie Paul who has impressive vocal abilities.

<P>

While the album "Why" is selling well in France and other countries ( USA, Brasil, Italy... ), it's
under this new formation that the band record the 4 title demo "Lethal Freedom" in may 1996. If the
studio is the same, we can note a sensible musical evolution with progressive touches where the
singing of Valérie expresses all its qualities. <BR>
This demo will receive good critics and will be the last work of SNAILBOOSTER. To obtain SYRENS CALL,
remove Yann and Schmé and add Thibaut Coisne ( guitar solo ). Thibaut has a talent out of the common
run : speed, feeling, melody are his main abilities and he adapted quickly himself in the band.

<P>

At the same time, the band manages since some years an association called BOOSTER PRODUCTIONS which
wants to promote Hard Rock in France and in the world. Amongst the projects is the realisation of a
compilation showing the french-belgian underground scene. <BR> This initiative will see the light of
day in january 1998 with METAL SESSIONS VOL. I.

<P>

With the 14 bands from all styles, you will discover on this CD the first song of SYRENS CALL titled
"Strange Reality", produced by Stéphane Buriez ( Loudblast ) with the help of a studio bassist. The
entire the CD benefits of a excellent production and a good presentation. <BR>"Strange Reality"
confirms the progressive heavy style of the band with numerous breaks and use of
synthesizer.

<P>

The band misses only a bassist to make 1998 a great year for SYRENS CALL. Their objectives are now a new album and
the conquest of new territories !!!
