Amongst the pure fans of Kiss, this album was not a secret. Almost every fan had it in bootleg version.
It was surely not in the tastes of Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons who decided to finally edit this new
record.

<P>

Let's thank Heaven they did that because this album is really good. I am not a Kiss specialist
( I only saw them twice live and I have Alive... it's all ! ), but the opinion I had after I listend
this CD was very positive.

<P>

Despite the fact Paul and Gene could easily be our fathers, they play a damned actual music. Of course,
we can't forget that Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer worked on this record. A friend of mine ( who is
a Kiss maniac since sooooo many times ) told me he was enchanted by this album.

<P>

One thing is sad about this album : it won't benefit of any advertising. Thus, people won't buy
( except pure fans ). I hope this review will fix this point a little.

<P>

My quote for Carnival Of Souls : 9/10 ( but I give a BIG 0/10 for the cover sleeve !!! What an horror... )
