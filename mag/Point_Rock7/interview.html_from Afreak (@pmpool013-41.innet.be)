<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> 1997 has been a productive year for the band : a new album, a european
tour with Paradise Lost. What is the impression of the band about 1997 ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Yes it was, we also played at Pukkelpop, Graspop and a lot of other festivals...It was
very good. Looking back now we did all the stuff we wanted to do.. except we didn't knew it would
be in 1997 !</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> You weren't prepared for that ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> I don't think you can prepare for something like this... You don't think about it when
you are rehearseling or recording an album. Those things wander in the back of your head, but you
don't prepare them.</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> what has been the best experience for Uncle Meat in 1997 ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Hard to say... The tour with paradise lost was a great experience... Pukkelpop was very
special because we're visiting that festival since we were 15 or 16 years old, it was always like
a dream to play there. I think we can not say this or that was the best experience. We see it as an
overall thing : you make an album and then you work, see what happens... It's fun to see the
evolution from the first steps in the rehearsal room, record the demos, then record it with Colin
Richardson ( another great experience ) and then go out and play. It's never over. Now we're kinda
waiting for the respons from abroad wich is exciting aswell.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> And how is the respons of the public, Do you consider it like the
ultimate goal, or do you play to satisfy your ego ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> I can't say what the thrill is : the audience or the fact that you play music you like.
But I consider playing live is the most fun part of it all, I think it is because of the respons
from the audience.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> Which exactly is ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Obviously you do it cause you like it, but if there's no audience or no respons, there's no
fun to it.<BR>
I think people are now finaly get to appreciate the music from Uncle Meat. We felt it alot
when we played on pukkelpop for instance. Lots of the reactions weere : "finaly you guy's get what you
deserve".<BR>
There is a major difference when you play abroad though...people go to see a concert and they don't
really know the band. The reaction you get from those people is without prejudice. In Belgium you
have lots of anvy and lots of people don't have an opinion of there own. It depends of the
circumstances though. But to answer your question : the respons from our concerts was great !</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B>So, I am pleased to know that... What are your projects now ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> We are currently working on a new album which is to be released
somewhere in autumn...We did some preproduction a few weeks ago and also we're gonna do a small tour
before we start the actual recordings.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> Great !!! Is it a local tour ( I mean in Belgium ) ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> The dates can be found on http://club.innet.be/~mon00372. There
is one date that will please you because it's in Wallonie. The others are in Austria and Germany. I
think one more in belgium too.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> Do you know already who will be the producer of the forthcoming
album ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Err, not exactly : we have some names in the running but we're
kinda waiting for reply.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> We'll keep the secret then !!!</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Err, yes :)</FONT><P>

<IMG WIDTH=410 HEIGHT=278 SRC="images/pl4.gif" ALT="Zony and Patrick">

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> I've had the occasion to hear something from preprod
( THX Internet !!! ), it's quite different from last album... Is it a new musical direction for the
band ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Ah ? You shouldn't ! :) No, I know, I've sent a small sample
from the preproduction into cyberspace !!! Err, new direction... I don't know. I think more of it
as 'growing', we realized that the songs we did on that demo were more 'songs' maybe more mature
too...you can still hear Uncle Meat though...I think :)</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> So, you have found your own style now ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> I think as a band you keep on searching for new things. Once
you quit that search you loose the 'spirit' if you know what I mean. I think that we're gonna come
closer to a sound of our own with the new material.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> For the readers, could you define the music of Uncle Meat ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> No, I can't really :)</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> You can't define your own music. Mmmh, is it because you don't
want to influence people : if you say " Oh, we play Heavy Metal ", people who don't like it won't
listen you ? Or is it because your music is a mix of a little everything ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> No, I can't label our music myself. I leave that up to people
who think in those terms. Our music is like you say influenced by different musicstyles. But it's
true, when you get labeled as a 'heavy metal band' some people will think it IS heavy metal, even if
your playing pop songs :)</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> Yeah, personaly, I could hear Metal in it, but other people
could understand something more "techno" ( because the use of samples ), anyway, this techno term
is a little too much extreme.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Samples are there but it's still guitar music with real drums.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> Just like Fear Factory....</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Mmmm, they use samples too. That's all I can think of as to
compare our music with Fear Factory.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> Could you name your influences ??? It will maybe help people
who have not yet heard your music to have a little idea.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Oh, I listen to all kind of stuff : some of my favourit bands
are Tool, Deftones, The Cure, Diamanda Gâlas, even The Smiths...</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> It's quite eclectic then...</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Definitely :) I wonder how people can stand listing to 'Only'
Heavy Metal or 'only' Techno'...</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> I share this opinion... It's crucial for me to be open-minded. <BR>
So, to finish this interview, what do you think about the actual situation in Belgium ??? Is it
a good country in terms of bands, and is it OK to make business here ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Oh dear !!! This could be a whole interview...I could complain
for ages about being a musiscian in Belgium.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> Really ?</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> If you really want to make it in music you have to live for it
24/7 otherwise it won't work. That means you can't have a job...no job = no money !!! It's a
viscious circle. And the gouverment is not doing anything to help young artists out. The best idea
they had recently was raising taxes on ALL bands, even if you're 16 years old and play for 1.000Bf (± $30).
per gig, so it suxx :)</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> But do you think Belgium has a good Scene in any styles :
Harcdore, Heavy, Progressive...</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Yes, but its all so small. Those scenes are struggling to keep
themselves alife. You can only take so much as a musiscian because there is so little support,
just a few belgian bands will make it out there.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> A good example was Channel Zero, who stopped recently.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Yes</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> So, it's not yet tomorrow we'll have MEGA-bands coming from
Belgium...</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> It's very hard to break out of Belgium. Everybody wants to
break out of Belgium because it's too small and you can't make a living as a 'non commercial band'.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> OK OK... This interview is now over, I let you now a free
speaking.. Tell everything you want, promote your band, greet someone... BUT DO SOMETHING !!!!</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Thank you very much for the interview. And all I have to say
is gonna be on the new album and on stage !! Cya out there on the road soon !!!</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> OK !!! Thx for the moments you stayed with me on this channel...
Belgacom will be happy !</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Afreak :</B> Ah yeah...FUCK Belgacom !! :-)))</FONT>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><B>Nr_18 :</B> Dear readers, you can testify that HE said that !!!</FONT>
