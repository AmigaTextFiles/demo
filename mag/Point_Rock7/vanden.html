<H1>Vanden Plas : Spirit of 66 ( Belgium )</H1>

<P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>

The last time Vanden Plas was programmed at Spirit of 66, their bassist broke a foot some days
before and thus, the gig has been replaced by AVALON.

<P>

New date, I don't want to miss them a second time. And it was near to do so !!! There was an error
on the program : the show was beginning at 10 p.m., but in reality, it was 8 p.m. !!!

<P>

But the band has been very kind and decided to play fot the guys who were there at 8, AND play again
for people coming at 10 !!!

<P>

In fact, I never heard this band before I was going on the show. I wanted to judge live about their
quality. And the quality was at rendez-vous ! God... their music is so melodic !! I begin to like more
and more progressive style because of this melodic line in the songs.

The musicians are really talented and professional. I remember the bass player with a broken foot playing
while sitting on a chair. The guitarist was always smiling to the crowd, seeming glad to be here
tonight.<BR>
The singer was trying to talk to us in french ( and he speaks nicely this language ;-) ).<P>

Despite the fact I came too late for the show, I have seen the band almost 1.5 hour on stage. The public
was enchanted to see the band and was singing together with the singer.<BR>
I think that the band came back two or three times on stage after the end, the atmosphere was very hot !!!

Unfortunately, I can't tell you the titles of the songs played that evening, but the songs extracted
from their latest album <I>The God Thing</I> are wonderfull. I have passed a real good moment.

<P>

Once again, the boss of the Spirit of 66 has been inspired when he invited Vanden Plas to play a gig
here in the little town of Verviers ( merci Mr Spirit !!! ). If you pass here someday, come on !!!
