Let's say it now : people who disliked <I>Load</I> won't love <I>Reload</I>. As in the previous album,
Metallica is radically different from the early days !<BR>
But for the guys ( and girls ) who appreciate the first part, this one is a good choice.

<P>

Of course, some songs are really strong : <I>Fuel</I> for example. But I also like the way the
band is playing atmospheric songs. Give a try to <I>Where The Wild Things Are</I>. I find this piece sounds
a little like Soundgarden.

<P>

2 ballads on this album : <I>Low Man's Lyric</I> and <I>The Unforgiven II</I> ( I admit this one is not so
original... the unforgiven II, why not Wherever I May Roam 3 while they're at work ??? ).

<P>

One thing I must say about that album is that I find it louder than the previous one : songs like <I>Devil's
Dance</I> are loud as a Black Sabbath who eat too much cakes ! Reload should have been called "Reloud" ;-)

<P>

Well, in final, we have here a good album which won't make the unanimity, but my quote is 8/10.
