This is the second album of Rammstein. The first one has been tested in P&R 6 and had a final quote
of 10/10. Sehnsucht is also extremely powerfull, but is a little different from Herzeleid.

<P>

It seems the band has decided to be more intelligent in their compositions. Herzeleid was the
equivalent of a fist in your face, this one is more diversified. It begins with an arab sample,
followed soon by a martial drum. If you go some tracks further, you can discover some pure diamonds :
"Klavier", "Spiel Mit Mir" where the voice of Till Lindemann is more calm than on other titles. There
is a lot of emotions in his voice.<BR>
"Klavier" is also the slowest song of the album.

<P>

As in the previous album, the keyboards are fully used with tons of samples. It may sound strange
sometimes ( "Du Hast" begins like a techno song ), but it's really effective.<BR>
All the lyrics are in german, but they are printed also in english, to discover what they say !!!

<P>

This album is excellent and deserves yet again the 10/10.
