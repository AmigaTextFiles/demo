<A NAME="Memory"><H2>The Memory Remains</H2></A>

Fortune, fame<BR>
Mirror vain<BR>
Gone insane<BR>
But the memory remains

<P>

Heavy rings on fingers wave<BR>
Another star denies the grave<BR>
See the nowhere crowd<BR>
Cry the nowhere cheers of honor

<P>

Like twisted vines that grow<BR>
Hide and swallow mansions whole<BR>
In light of an already<BR>
Faded prima donna

<P>

Fortune, fame<BR>
Mirror vain<BR>
Gone insane<BR>
Fortune, fame<BR>
Mirror vain<BR>
Gone insane<BR>
But the memory remains

<P>

Heavy rings hold cigarettes<BR>
Up to lips that time forgets<BR>
While the Hollywood sun sets<BR>
Behind your back

<P>

And can't the band play on<BR>
Just listen, they play my song<BR>
Ash to ash<BR>
Dust to dust<BR>
Fade to black

<P>

Fortune, fame<BR>
Mirror vain<BR>
Gone insane<BR>
Fortune, fame<BR>
Mirror vain<BR>
Gone insane<BR>
Dance little tin goddess

<P>

Drift away<BR>
Fade away<BR>
Little tin goddess

<P>

Ash to ash<BR>
Dust to dust<BR>
Fade to black

<P>

Fortune, fam<BR>
Mirror vain<BR>
Gone insane<BR>
Fortune, fame<BR>
Mirror vain<BR>
Gone insane<BR>
But the memory remains

<P>

Ash to ash<BR>
Dust to dust<BR>
Fade to black<BR>
But the memory remains<BR>
Yeah<BR>
Faded prima donna<BR>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

<A NAME="Unforgiven"><H2>The Unforgiven II</H2></A>

Lay beside me, tell me what they've done<BR>
Speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run<BR>
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true<BR>
If you can understand the me, than I can understand the you

<P>

Lay beside me, under wicked sky<BR>
The black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze<BR>
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through<BR>
Black hearts scarring darkness still, but there's no sun shining through<BR>
No, there's no sun shining through<BR>
No, there's no sun shining

<P>

What I've felt, what I've known<BR>
Turn the pages, turn the stone<BR>
Behind the door, should I open it for you

<P>

Yeah<BR>
What I've felt, what I've known<BR>
Sick and tired, I stand alone<BR>
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you<BR>
Or are you unforgiven too ?

<P>

Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear<BR>
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again<BR>
She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone<BR>
Black hearts scarring darker steel, yes, she'll be there when I'm gone<BR>
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there

<P>

What I've felt, what I've known<BR>
Turn the pages, turn the stone<BR>
Behind the door, should I open it for you

<P>

Yeah<BR>
What I've felt, what I've known<BR>
Sick and tired, I stand alone<BR>
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you<BR>
Or are you unforgiven too ?

<P>

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done<BR>
The door is closed, so are your eyes<BR>
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun<BR>
Yes, now I see it

<P>

What I've felt, what I've known<BR>
Turn the pages, turn the stone<BR>
Behind the door, should I open it for you

<P>

Yeah<BR>
What I've felt, what I've known<BR>
So sick and tired, I stand alone<BR>
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits<BR>
The one who waits for you

<P>

Oh, what I've felt, what I've known<BR>
Turn the pages, turn the stone<BR>
Behind the door, should I open it for you<BR>
So I dub thee unforgiven

<P>

Oh, what I've felt<BR>
Oh, what I've known

<P>

I take this key<BR>
And I bury it in you<BR>
Because you're unforgiven too

<P>

Never free<BR>
Never me<BR>
'cause you're unforgiven too<BR>
Oh

<A NAME="Lyrics"><H2>Low Man's Lyrics</H2></A>

My eyes seek reality<BR>
My fingers seek my veins<BR>
There's a dog at your back step<BR>
He must come in from the rain<BR>
I fall 'cause I let go<BR>
The net below has right away<BR>
So my eyes seek reality<BR>
And my fingers seek my veins

<P>

The trash fire is warm<BR>
No one's safe from the storm<BR>
And I can't bare to see<BR>
What I've let me be<BR>
So wicked and worn

<P>

So as I write to you<BR>
What is dawning to do<BR>
Maybe you'll understand<BR>
And won't cry for this man<BR>
'cause low man is due<BR>
Please forgive me

<P>

My eyes seek reality<BR>
My fingers feel for flame<BR>
Touch clean with a dirty hand<BR>
I touched the clean to the waste

<P>

The trash fire is warm<BR>
No one's safe from the storm<BR>
I can't bare to see<BR>
What I've let me be<BR>
So wicked and worn

<P>

So as I write to you, yeah<BR>
What is dawning to do, yeah<BR>
Maybe you'll understand<BR>
And won't cry for this man<BR>
'cause low man is due<BR>
Please forgive me<BR>
Please forgive me<BR>
Please forgive me

<P>


Solo, the sky is all I see<BR>
All I want from you is forget me<BR>
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain<BR>
Though he just wants right back out again

<P>

And I cry, to the alley way<BR>
Confess all to the rain<BR>
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror<BR>
One I've broken, to match my face

<P>

The trash fire is warm

<P>

No one's safe from the storm<BR>
And I can't bare to see<BR>
What I've let me be<BR>
So wicked and worn

<P>

So as I write to you, yeah<BR>
What is dawning to do, yeah<BR>
Maybe you'll understand<BR>
And won't cry for this man<BR>
'cause low man is due<BR>
Please forgive me<BR>
Please forgive me

<P>

Solo, the sky is all I see<BR>
All I want from you is forget me<BR>
So, you bring this poor dog in from the rain<BR>
Though he just wants right back out again

My eyes seek reality<BR>
My fingers seek my veins<BR>

Throw all your bullets in the fire<BR>
And stand there<P>

Born into attitude<BR>
Twist mother tongue<BR>
Throwing all your bullets in the fire<BR>
And run like hell<BR>
I get a fever, what ever happened to sweat?<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="Fixxxer"><H2>Fixxxer</H2></A>

Yeah<BR>
Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins<BR>
One for each of us and our sins<BR>
So you lay us in a line<BR>
Push your pins, they make us humble<BR>
Only you can tell in time<BR>
If we'll fall or merely stumble<P>

But tell me<BR>
Can you heal what father's done<BR>
Or fix this hole in mother's son<BR>
Can you heal the broken worlds within<BR>
Can you strip away so we may start again<BR>
Tell me, can you heal what father's done<BR>
Or cut this rope and let us in<BR>
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free<BR>
You jab another pin<BR>
Jab another pin in me<P>

Mirror, mirror upon the wall<BR>
Break the spell or become the doll<BR>
See you sharpening the pins<BR>
So the holes will remind us<BR>
We're just the toys in the hands of another<BR>
And in time needles turn from shine to rust<P>

But tell me<BR>
Can you heal what father's done<BR>
Or fix the hole in mother's son<BR>
Can you heal the broken worlds within<BR>
Can you strip away so we may start again<BR>
Tell me, can you heal what father's done<BR>
Or cut this rope and let us run<BR>
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free<BR>
You jab another pin<BR>
Jab another pin in me<BR>
Jab it<P>

Blood for face<BR>
Sweat for dirt<BR>
Three x's for the stone<BR>
To break this curse<BR>
A ritual's due<BR>
I believe I'm not alone<BR>
Shell of shotgun<P>

Pint of gin<BR>
Numb us up to shield the pins<BR>
Renew our faith which way we can<BR>
To fall in love with life again<BR>
To fall in love with life again<BR>
To fall in love with life again<BR>
To fall in love<BR>
To fall in love<BR>
To fall in love with life again<P>

So tell me<BR>
Can you heal what father's done<BR>
Or fix the hole in mother's son<BR>
Can you heal the broken worlds within<BR>
Can you strip away so we may start again<BR>
Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done<BR>
Or cut this rope and let us run<BR>
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free<BR>
You jab another pin<BR>
Jab another pin in me<BR>
Oh yeah<P>

No more pins in me, yeah<BR>
No more, no more pins in me<BR>
No more, no more pins in me<BR>
No more, no more, no more<BR>
No, no, no<BR>

<P>
