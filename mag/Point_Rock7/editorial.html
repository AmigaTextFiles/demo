<H2><B>Heads up !!!</B></H2><P>

Before anything, I would like to wish you all the best for 1998. I hope this year will give you
plenty of things.<BR>
In musical area, we could expect great things in 1998 : I have heard that maybe a festival would
be held in Germany and featuring <I>Judas Priest</I> and <I>Iron Maiden</I>, we could also expect
a new tour of Metallica ( why not ? ). I have also read that Maiden wants to come back to the shows
of their glorious years. After all, they are not the firsts to do that ( i.e. Kiss ).

<P>

As long as I have support ( and I have it believe me ), Point & Rock will continue to see the light
of day. I really love that work and I would not like to stop it now... I just want to apologise if some
delays appears in the publication of the mag. I have so many pages to maintain updated : the mag,
<A HREF="http://www.ping.be/insanity/">my homepage</A>, a site of norvegian friends...

<P>

In this issue, I have managed to interview or get some stuff from 2 bands : I have net-interviewed the
drummer of <A HREF="interview.html">Uncle Meat</A>, a member of <A HREF="syrens.html">Syrens Call</A>
has mailed me an article about his band.<BR>
As always : news from everywhere, your charts, lyrics (Reload from Metallica)...

<P>

Enjoy your visit on this site, come as often as you want. My work is finished... until next edition ;-)
