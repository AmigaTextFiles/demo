<H1>Paradise Lost - L'atelier ( Luxembourg ) : 26 November 1997</H1>

<P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>

When I heard the last album of Paradise Lost, I really wanted to see them live to see how they would
retranscript the songs on stage. So when Afreak of Uncle Meat told me they were the support band of
Paradise Lost and that was on the guest-list of Uncle Meat, I was enchanted !<P>

I and a friend were in Luxembourg quite early and we met Uncle Meat before the gig. Just the time
to chat and they went away for the balance.<BR>
We enter in the place and I take place front stage to see Uncle Meat. I must say I felt that the
band has played their songs every night during 2 months. Some tunes have gained in quality and
execution (i.e. '22').

<P>

After Uncle Meat, a second band "Sundown" played in a gothic register but the prestation was not
impressive. Sometimes, I was wondering what the guitar and the bass players were doing on stage.
The singer and the drummer were doing all the job.

<P>

After those two support bands, we finaly saw Paradise Lost on stage.<BR>
I had read in the press that despite Nick Holmes has made great improvements on his voice on the
album, he was singing as in the other albums on stage. It was not the case here. I don't know
on other dates but in Luxembourg, it was superb !! Just like on 'One Second'.

<BR CLEAR="ALL"><P>

Nearly half of the show was dedicated to songs of the new album. Musically, there is nothing to say.
Songs were perfectly played (let's say that it was the end of the tour !!!). Nick Holmes
felt at ease with the crowd.<BR>

The crowd gave also a good respons to the band. The atmosphear was hot as well as on stage and front
stage.<P>
The set list was the same as the one I read in the press, so it seems the band has played the same
songs every night (it could be boring at the end).<P>

Here is the complete set list :
<UL>
<LI>Say Just Words<BR>
<LI>Hallowed Land<BR>
<LI>Blood Of Another<BR>
<LI>True Belief<BR>
<LI>Disappear<BR>
<LI>Dying Freedom<BR>
<LI>Elusive Cure<BR>
<LI>Mercy<BR>
<LI>Shadow Kings<BR>
<LI>The Sufferer<BR>
<LI>Rememberance<BR>
<LI>Forever Failure<BR>
<LI>Soul Courageous<BR>
<LI>One Second<BR>
<LI>------------<BR>
<LI>This Cold Life<BR>
<LI>Embers Fire<BR>
<LI>As I Die<BR>
<LI>Last Time<BR CLEAR="ALL">
</UL>

<P>

After the show, I have once again met Ivan of Uncle Meat. We drank one or two beers while speaking about
the tour and other things. When I said him I took the booklet of 'One Second', he told me it could be
possible to meet the band. unfortunately, only one member was still in the house : Lee Morris, the drummer
of Paradise Lost.<P>

So, I have talked with him some minutes, just the time to tell him all the good I think about 'One Second'
and the show, take one picture and sign my booklet (which has been signed later by the rest of the band).

<BR CLEAR="ALL"><P>

It has been a very good event. It was also the first time I've had the occasion to speak with a member
of a well-known band... it's always a good souvenir !!!
