<H1>Last words</H1>

<P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>

Each time it's the same thing : at the end of a new issue, I am happy because I have finished
a long work... And each time I think it means begin a new one !!!

<P>

But I have tons of CD's to listen while I type the miles of text of Point & Rock !!!

<P>

Next time, I am planning to build a directory of all internet Sites of many many bands... So if
you have some good URL's to share with me, please <A HREF="mailto:nr18@geocities.com">mail me</A>
your bookmarks and I will include them in P&R 8.

<P>

In the next issue, I will surely have listen the new album of Iron Maiden ( who is as you probably
know now, my favourite band ). All the tests will be published.

<P>

That's it... I have no more things to say except that I hope my work has pleased you again and that
I give you rendez-vous in Point & Rock 8 ( I'll try to avoid delays this time but who knows ? ;-)  ).

<P>

OK, for this issue...
