<H1>LED ZEPPELIN</H1>

Led Zeppelin has become the music industry's second-best-selling artist with more than 63.8 million
albums making their way into the marketplace. The new round of certifications comes after the defunct
band's label, Atlantic Records, provided updated sales information to the Recording Industry Assn.

<H1>THE PRESIDENTS OF THE USA</H1>

The Presidents of the United States of America have left office. The Seattle rock band announced
it is breaking up so Chris Ballew, the lead singer and chief songwriter, can do other things. The
band's first album sold 4 million copies and the follow-up just topped 1 million. The Presidents
were known for a more upbeat, melodic sound than that of other Seattle scene bands like Pearl Jam
and Nirvana.<BR>
Ballew's first solo album is expected to be released in january 1998 and he is also said to be
working on a television pilot. Nonetheless, he hopes to do a final concert with the Presidents
early this year.<BR>

<H1>MÖTLEY CRÜE</H1>

Two members of the Motley Crue rock group, Tommy Lee and Nikki Sixx, were arrested 10th of December
1997 for allegedly assaulting a security guard in a post-concert melee caused when the group invited
fans to invade the stage, police said 11th of December. Lee and Sixx were taken into custody after
performing at the America West Arena in Phoenix where they allegedly attacked Kenneth Lee Chambers,
18. They were released early Thursday, and police said they faced one count each of misdemeanor
assault. Lee, 34, and Sixx, 39, could not be reached for comment.

<P>

Rocker Tommy Lee pled no contest on the 12th of January to assaulting a photographer and was put on
probation and ordered to undergo "anger counseling." Lee, married to former "Baywatch" star Pamela
Lee, was also ordered to pay $17,500 in restitution to photographer Henry Trappler and placed on
probation for 24 months. He must complete 12 hours of counseling to learn how to control his anger
and pay a fine of $1,800 or carry out 250 hours of community service. He was not required to appear
in court because it was a misdemeanor, but Lee came to Beverly Hills Municipal Court and pleaded
no contest to a single battery charge.
