  Using Multiview (or any other guide-shower) is easy. If you
  have found the way up to this page, I am sure that you know
  how to handle this utility. Anyway, here's a small descrip-
  tion of the buttons you can click in the upper side.

  Contents   shows the Contents of the part of the guide where
             you are at the moment of clicking

  Index      loads the index part (productions, parties, system)

  Help       leads you to this text you are reading now

  Retrace    brings you back to the page which you have read before

  Browse <   leads your way back through the guide, i.e.
             shows the last node

 @{b}The History@{ub}


 Version : V1.0
 Released: 11th November 1995 (Amiga Exposition '95)
 Size    : 336.516K
 Comment : the first public release

 Version : 1/3 in 1996
 Released: 24th January 1996
 Size    : 483.731K
 Numbers : informationon about 143 parties and 1158 productions
 Comment : improved the lay-out a lot, especially the overview
           of the parties (main-table); included an index part
           (thanks to Ralph Seichter for his Agix V1.2);  cor-
           rected some mistakes and  cleaned up some troubles-
           making links; added an install-script, Read-Me-Text
           and a few nice icons and, of course, added much in-
           formation about new and old productions & parties!



 @{b}The Future@{ub}

  The  guide  will be updated about every 4th month, so there will
  be  3  issues  in  a  year,  one  in January (after The Party in
  Denmark),  one  in  May  (after  The Assembly) and one in August
  (after The Gathering).

  I have  much more texts  which will be  used in  this guide,  so
  expect The Scene to  grow a lot in the future  (this  depends on
  your support too!). Then again, more information will be pressed
  into  each party, like visitors, prices, extra events and so on.
  Plus I want to add the party  where a production was released to
  each of its description  (if you click from index you don't know
  exactly when it was released) ... and I have a lot more ideas.

  As soon as possible  we will include  a short description of the
  productions  (e.g. what happens in the demo, what music-style is
  offered in the sounddisk, etc.) ... be surprised or be dead! :-b

  I have seen 2 guide-viewers  in the near past,  but one was ugly
  and the other did not display  this guide correctly,  reason un-
  known.  Could someone please send me a nice guide-viewer??

  I would like someone to create a nice  installer-script  for the
  original Commodore Installer and probably someone who could code
  a small intro for @{i}The Scene.@{ui}

@node orderstuff " Where can I order these demos? "
@toc information


           @{b}WHERE CAN I GET THIS DAMN STUFF FROM?@{ub}


 The  most of the productions listed in @{i}The Scene @{ui}can be found in
 the  Aminet  or  Funet.  Meanwhile the Aminet administrators and
 several distributors are selling CDs containing this material as
 well,   such  as  the  Aminet  CDs  or  the  Euro-Demo-CDs  from
 Almathera @{"(PD-Distributors)" link pddistributors}.

 To avail exact information about these CDs try to get the guide-
 text called  "Amiga CD-Rom Guide V1.4".  It can be  found in the
 Aminet at docs/hyper or can be ordered directly from the author,
 Anders Bakkevold @{"(Addresses)" link addresses_sub}.

 If you, by chance, can't get your hands on a demo you would like
 to  call  your  own,  you can contact us for getting information
 like  addresses of distributors or exact net sites.  If possible
 (i.e.   if we have the wanted production) we are also willing to
 copy this for you, but please notice that we are no cheap source
 for getting demos from.  So if you would like to receive a demo,
 then  send  the  disks  being  needed for it plus the stamps for
 sending  your  letter  back.  And please notice that the maximum
 disk  number  we  will  copy  for  you  is  5 disks (except if a
 production needs more disks, like Suburban Base's musicdisk) ...
 We  are  sorry  for these conditions, but we are no millionaires
 and  we  don't want to hang loose behind our computers the whole
 day.  :)

 We  also  plan to release about 2,5Gb of the best scene stuff on
 CDs  for  a  price  of  25 DM each.  If you want to order one of
 those  CDs  or  request a catalogue, don't hesitate to send me a
 short mail. @{"(Author's Address)" link addresses}.

  @{b}What is @{i}The Scene? @{ui}@{ub}


   This  guide  was  written  and  compiled for the purpose to unite all
   releases from the important Amiga-Scene-Parties into one list, mainly
   as a small orientation  for  everybody  who collects or searches  for
   special productions  or  for  productions  from special groups or who
   wants to gather information  (like hardware requirements, single pro-
   ducers or what so ever) about a special production. I hope this guide
   is helpful for at least some of you :)

   This guide does not include:
     - pack series (rarely own group's file demos collections)
     - mag-parts of any pack series
     - any productions including nazi-propaganda
     - sounddisks just playing a module with no code and GFX
     - cheat disks, doc disks or solution disks
     - games or game-clones
     - tools or tool-clones
     - the most of those ugly hardcore demos and slideshows
     - various private module or slideshow collections
     - any stuff (PD-series) from commercial PD-distributors.

   Productions in this guide are only pure ...
     - file demos (dentros)
     - disk demos (megademos, trackmos)
     - intros
     - packmenu previews
     - diskmags
     - sounddisks
     - slideshows.

   I hope that you can find use for this guide and that you are thinking
   about @{"supporting me" link support} in the further development. Thanks in advance!

    @{b}The problem with the correct results @{ub}

     We're very sorry that there are no complete results
     but the organizers even seemed to be not capable to
     unite a  few groups in  a small text;  the official
     results only  included some vague  names of the de-
     signers. We will try to find out all the other pro-
     ductions and their correct  positions till the next
     update of @{i}The Scene. @{ui}

     Remark    : two versions available: for MC68020 and MC68030
     Remark    : Demo was originally no. 1 at Doom's Day Party 1994,
                 but rules stated that the demo must work on a stan-
                 dard A1200 (demo supported MC68030, but worked on a
                 A1200 MC68020 too!). So Rebels got only two bottles
                 of wine instead of the  winning price - seems to be
                 that the party-organizers  had less money than they
                 had expected :)
