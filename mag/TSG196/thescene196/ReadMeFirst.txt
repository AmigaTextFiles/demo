Dear readers!

I have noticed that some swappers are sending the guide-
text only,  instead of the  whole  lha-package.  As  the
guide  itself  (from this issue on)  needs  some  of the
files from the lha-package (e.g. the PPshow-command, the
iff-advert or original installer-script) I would like to
see that you're only spreading the complete lha-package!
Thanks in advance!

If you are a  PD-distributor and  you would  like to see
your advert in  this guide,  don't hesitate to send your
offers to the address given below.

I would  be very glad  if I would get  more support  for
<The Scene>.  Just send  any information  you  can  get,
everything  is welcome,  even just a small  message with
your opinion about this <The Scene>.

Send anything to:
