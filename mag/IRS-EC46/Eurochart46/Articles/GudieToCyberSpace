»CL8:                          Written by Zerox of Gods

»CL1:In every issue of D.I.S.C.  the latest
years,  I've had a section which dealt
with   internet-related   issues.   As
D.I.S.C.   died nearly two months ago,
I've decided to move the internetguide
into   the   EuroChart  instead.   The
Internet has been very interesting for
Amiga  owners  the last 7 years or so,
but  especially  the latest years with
so   many   groups  having  their  own
homepages   and  so  many  ftp  sites.
There  are  also  lots  of  sites with
democollections and general Amiganews.







This  article is just meant as a small
guide  to  the  best  and  most common
Amiga sites.  So here we go!

First  of all, there are 3 major sites
dealing   with   all   kind  of  scene
matters.
