»CL8:                         Written by Adonis of IRIS

»CL1:I  have  been  thinking  a while about
this  subject  and  I  am  not sure if
there  are so many important things to
write about this, but I will give it a
try.   As  I  see it there are several
online  games, so let me try to sum up
what there is out there.

1.   First you have all the games that
do  not  involve 3D graphics, but only
text combined with some graphics.  Let
us call them simple strategy games who








are turn based.  (Utopia, Battlefleet,
Heros, Okrfia etc.)

2.   Then  we  have the 3D based games
(Counterstrike,   Command  &  Conquer,
Splinter Cell, Everguest, Ultima etc)

3.  And last the java based games, all
sorts  of  smaller  games (card games,
chess, domino etc).

We  all know that it is incredible how
many  hours  that  are  spent on these
games and even more incredible is that
so  many  persons,  young,  old,  fat,
thin,   black  and  white  people  are
playing  these  games.  No matter what
game  you  are  playing  of  the  more
common  ones,  you  will  achieve some
sort  of  society  and  network,  some
stronger  and  more alive than others.
I  will  now  try to take each type of
games  and  explain what I think these
games  are  good for and what they can
do  and  what  they  might  involve of
negative things.

»CL8:Type 1

»CL1:All  the text based games you can find
online  are those I prefer to play and
the  reasons  will follow below.  Most
of  these  games  are  minute  or hour
based,  so the game is running even if
you do not log in for some hours/days.
If you are one of those who are online
most  of  the  day  and  have  nothing
better  to  do  then you might have an
advantage  in  these  games.  The main
idea  of  these  games  are  to  put a
certain amount of people into the same
time,  lets  say 25 and then they have
to  make  things  run  and  work  as a
community.  So it is not just plug and
play,  but  it more about strategy and
communication.   If  you  end  up with
some persons who are not interested in
having  that  much  contact  with  the
persons  they  are  playing with, then
the result can be seen on your overall
points,  since  you  are  not  able to
coordinate  and make sure that you get
the  best out of the rules.  Many evil
tongues  has  claimed  that  all  this
online  being invoke that people loose
contact  with  the  world  outside and
forget  how  to have a conversation in
real  life.   But those who spend more
time  on this type of game are some of
the  few  that  actually  learn how to
respect,  listen and judge situations,
which  they  will  also  experience in
real life.

»CL8:Type 2

»CL1:These types of games are the worst you
can find, since they are those who are
not  increasing  or improving people’s
ability  to  communicate and socialize
with  people  they  meet in real life;
sure   you   can   always   find  some
"victims"   who   are  still  able  to
practice  normal  conversation.  These
games  are mostly based on killing and
hovoc,  without any real communication
or  strategy.   Of  course some of the
games  that  also  include roleplaying
and   not  only  hack  and  slash  can
educate  a  little, but there is still
no  communication  or  at  least  very
little of it.  So if people claim that
these  games  are not good/healthy for
those  young people, then I do not say
that  they  are  right, but I say that
they  for  sure  do  not  make  people
better at communication.

»CL8:Type 3

»CL1:The  games  we  have  here, is more or
less  used  by  the person who have no
real  interest  in  computers and they
only seek some pleasure on the net and
maybe  some of them are also bored and
lacking   the   social   network  that
"normal"  people  have.  The games you
find   in  this  category  are  really
simple,  but  nevertheless also really
enjoyable   and   full   of  gameplay.
However,  you  get  tired of them fast
since the to not really challenge you,
but  you can always bring them out now
and  then since they are still full of
gameplay  after  hours  of playing, as
long  as  you  leave it alone for some
time.

I  know  that  I  know  nothing  about
peoples  mind, their behaviour and how
they  react  if they have been sliding
into the realm of online gaming, but I
still  think that it is not completely
wrong what I have been writing in this
article.   This was just a little view
of  my  thoughts  about this, that all
these  games  online do not have to be
harmful or make people antisocial.
