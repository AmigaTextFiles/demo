»CL8:                         Written by Zerox of Gods

»CL0:Earlier tonight, infact many hours and
some  beers  earlier,  we've  seen the
4k-intros presented.

Now  I'll try my best to some reviews,
even  though  I can't exactly say I've
seen   the   intros   many  times  nor
remember too much.

However,  lets  begin  before it's too
late.   There  were  3  entries in the
compo.








Entry 1:  Tlu 4k.exe by Tolou

It's  an  intro which supposed to have
been  made  back  in  1997,  but which
wasn't released before now.  It has no
music, and we can perhaps say it has 3
effects all in all.

We  see  a  quite  small texturemapped
object/background   in   few  colours,
which  is  kinda  being sucked towards
the  upper  left  in  the  screen very
slowly.
Then it's the some of the same mapping
used  again,  but the object look more
like a circle if I remember correctly,
and it's expanding out in the screen.

The  last  routine  is  the exact same
mapping  as  the first effect, and the
background  is generally just rotating
and being zoomed very slowly.

All  in  all,  quite a bad intro which
wasn't up to the standard of 1997.


Entry 2:  Fact by Scarab

Now  we've  moved  over to the quality
entries in this compo.

This   intro   got   quite  many  nice
details,  but  unfortunately  I'm  not
very  good  in  noticing these things.
However, the intro starts of with some
good music including a nice bass.

We see an object with 4 screens.  This
figure  spinning  around  is  actually
animated,   but  the  effects  on  the
screens themselves are naturally coded
in real-time.

We  fast  switch from the first effect
onto the second one, which is the S in
the  Scarab sign with some nice design
around it.

We  move  over to the 4 screens again,
which  are spinning around.  You could
see that's its written like Scarab one
on screen, Fact on another etc.
Afterwards  we  zoom  into  one of the
screens.  Quite nice.

Now  the  best  effect  of  the entire
intro   appears,   it's  some  greatly
created  particles  which  is  flowing
down   over   the   screen   perfectly
natural.     The   opposite   triangle
prevents  all particles in hitting the
ocean.   Well, I can't really remember
that  much  more.   Except we see some
more  of  the  4 screens, we zoom into
another   one  with  the  S  in  green
colours  blinking etc.  All in all, we
zoom  into  all  of  the screens.  The
last one is simply saying Scarab, Fact
on  a  blue  background.   And I guess
it's being reduced and faded out.

All  in  all,  a  very nice intro with
many   good  details.   Also  a  great
samplecalculator  was  used to do this
intro.   The  only problem is that the
intro is too short after my opinion.

Entry  3:   Timur Lenk by Spaceballs &
Ephidrena.

Again  Spaceballs  and  Ephidrena have
gone  together  to make an intro.  The
title  seems to be taken from the name
of an mongolian warlord.

The  intro  starts  off  with  a black
screen and the name Timur Lenk written
down at the left side of the screen.

Then  the  show has opened.  We see an
texturemapped    object    which    is
rotating,   changing,   2   parts  are
melting    together,    then   getting
separated,   and   then  suddenly  the
object   is  being  divided  into  two
screens  which are looking exactly the
same.

Next is a cool effect.  It's some kind
of  spiral, perhaps texturemapped.  At
least   it's   very   colourful.   The
circles inside are of different sizes.
This object is rotating etc.  Suddenly
a  small  screens  pops up down in the
right  of the screen I think.  It's an
exact  copy of the object.  The object
also seems to be a bit blurred.

Afterwards  we  get some credits, it's
written  Spaceballs, Ephidrena, Slummy
and    Loaderror.     Quite   a   good
combination of forces.

Then  we  see something similar as the
opening  effect,  just  that's more is
done  with  this effect.  More effects
are added.

Some  backgrounds are added, and their
moving  slowly.   In front of them, we
see the shadows of some objects.

We see a rather strong lighted object,
which is moving around.  Nice.

Back  again  returns the spiral vector
object, it's changing a lot.

Again  an  object/effect  which  looks
like   the   first   effect   appears.
Naturally  more  things  are happening
this time around.
At the end the name Timur Lenk appears
again.

I  have  to  say that this is the best
intro,  and  it  will most likely win,
just like TBL will win the demo compo.
The  intro was quite good, with really
great  music.   Nothing  more  to  add
really.

All  I  can  say is that I've probably
forget  about  lots  of  stuff  in the
mentioned  intros,  so  if you haven't
seen the intros by now, do so!!!

A very tired Zerox is signing off...
