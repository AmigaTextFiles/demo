»CL8:                    Written by Lahve of Scoopex & Reason

»CL0:There   has  been  many  articles
written about us, we were mentioned in
various   articles,   but  anyway,  as
Darkhawk  wrote  in  one  of  the most
impressive  articles  he  ever did, we
will die soon.

During  all  my  time  in the swapping
scene,  I  had  a feeling people don't
accept  us  as  real  members in their
groups.   I don't mean the friendship,
this  unique thing still hangs on here








and   I've  never  been  at  war  with
anyone,  but we are not the guys being
able  to discuss the mainstream of the
scene  with others::  demos.  We stand
clear  of the others, hiding and being
used for spreading the productions and
keeping the friendship.

Can   others   really  understand  our
function?   Do all people know what we
really    do?     Aren't    we    only
"stamplickers"   in   the  opinons  of
others?

Yesterday  my  daddy came to me asking
me  what  I'm  doing.   I  told him my
position   in  the  Eurochart  and  my
happiness  about that, expressing what
I'm  doing  to  get to this place.  "I
just write a few letters to my friends
spreading  the  productions to and for
them",  I said.  "That's all you do to
get   prestige?"   "Yes",  I  replied.
"It's all I'm able to do for the scene
when  I  have  no  talent for anything
else.   It's  so  easy when you're not
lazy,  you  can write in english a bit
and  you're  friendly.",  I  told him.
"Ah,  strange".   I  was  too tired to
tell  him  what  the scene is about in
general  and  how  important  it is to
keep  the  traditional ways there.  My
father  still  thought all I do is the
stamps lickin'.

Due  to  the  lack  of people swapping
these   days,   sceners  realized  how
unimportant  a  function  swapping is.
Many  of  them have no swappers inside
the  team  simply  because  they don't
need  to  spread  own  stuff  by  this
arduous  way, they prefer e-mails, FTP
servers  etc.  On the other hand, some
older  groups  wanting  to keep an old
origin,  accept  swappers  just to get
the  old feeling back.  Luckily, Amiga
groups  are  among  these,  having one
swapper  at  least although they don't
need  them so urgently.  'Swappers are
not  necessary  for demoscening', they
thought and they're right.

How  long can we continue until people
will  kick  us  out  of  the demoscene
forever?   Read  Darkhawk's article in
the previous Eurochart where Christian
describes  what  will happen if people
realize  we're not important for them.
All  good  swappers  have gone, only a
few remain, but I still haven't gotten
a  snailmail  for  ages...   Should  I
think  we,  swappers,  are  still here
being  important or are we just only a
stupid stamplickers?
