»CL8:                         Written by Zerox of Gods

»CL1:I've written various scene-reports for
a decade now, and for every time a new
report  has  to  be written, there are
less groups to write about.  Therefore
I've always mentioned many groups that
weren't  very  likely  to ever release
more productions.  This time I'll skip
writing   about   the   dead  and  the
inactive  groups,  and  I'll  also not
mention groups with only a few members
that  aren't  able to make productions
on  their own.  This time I'll instead








focus   on  the  last  few  productive
forces  of the proud danish scene.  So
if YOUR group is not mentioned in this
report, then it's simply time to start
getting  active  again  (on Amiga that
is!).    Therefore   I   won't   write
anything   about   groups  like  Focus
Design, Gunnars Farvebio and Spoon for
instance for now.




»CL8:DEPTH:

»CL1:-  Depth is the first group I consider
somewhat active, even though it's some
time  ago  we  got an Amiga production
from them.  The group got founded back
in  1993  and  most  people  know them
because  they  took over the EuroChart
from  Static Bytes, and have impressed
by  releasing  issue  28  to  43.  The
latest issues were in cooperation with
IRIS,  which  have now taken over the
mag entirely.  Depth also have members
in  Finland, Norway and England.  They
are  known to do some crazy things now
and  then.   The  member Curt Cool has
started an ambitious project to gather
all  scene-modules  and composers in a
BIG archive by the way.  Help him!  At
the  Trsac  3 party Depth released the
demo  Bizzare  Love  Triangle  in coop
with  Haujobb  and  TRSI,  and this is
probably  the  last  Amiga  production
from the danish side of this crew.  At
the  TRSAC  FU  party  2002, Curt Cool
came  second  in  the music compo with
his   module  Kalas,  and  Depth  also
released a PC demo at that party.  The
next release from Depth should perhaps
be  a  musicpack,  or maybe another PC
demo?

»CL8:EFREET:

»CL1:-  This  is  a  small  group which you
don't  hear  from too often.  But when
you do, you know it's good.  The intro
Deep Pan for instance had lots of good
routines  and a good precalculation of
music.   The most famous member got to
be the coder-wizard BlueBerry which is
a   double-member   as  he's  also  in
Loonies.   They  are often seen at the
Danish  parties.   Last  release was a
4k-intro at the Mekka-Symposium 2002.

Deep Pan, Peanut and Splat II

»CL8:HAUJOBB:

»CL1:-  The  Danish  side  of  Haujobb  the
latest   years,  has  been  the  coder
Optima.   At  the TRSAC FU party 2002,
he   released   another  intro.   It's
called Tetsuo 3 and won the compo.

Well-Known   Production:    Tetsuo  3,
Bizzare  Love  Triangle  and  MegaDemo
2000.

Well-Known Member:  Optima

»CL8:IRIS:

»CL1:-  This is one of the oldest groups in
the  scene today.  They have been very
active  the  latest years and released
many    quality   productions.    IRIS
members   usually   also  attend  many
parties, and arrange the Scene Meeting
themselves.  In addition to the Danish
members,  they  have  a few members in
countries   such   as  Great  Britain,
Poland,  Germany  and  USA.  They have
taken  over  the EuroChart from Depth,
and  been  a  coop  partner in the now
dead mag D.I.S.C..  IRIS got to be one
of  the  leading  danish crews and can
also  be considered to be a good group
in international standard.  The latest
releases  in addition to Dolly Buster,
is D.I.S.C.  14, and now EuroChart 46!
They're  working  on a demo and a game
to  be released here at the Breakpoint
party.

»CL8:LOONIES

»CL1:-  This  was a group which got founded
nearly   8  years  ago,  and  now  has
achieved  to  become  one  of the very
best  groups of the scene.  Especially
the   latest   demos   and  a  certain
musicdisk have gotten attention.  They
are  known to have some weird-style or
deal with themes in their productions,
and  are also present at most parties.
I  think all members are from Denmark.
They   have   also  been  very  active
lately,  and won both the SM party and
MS      party     in     2000     with
Cybercinematastic    and    Arla,   in
addition  to  the  TRSAC2  with At The
Movies  demo.  At Mekka-Symposium 2001
they managed to come second with their
Hotstyle  Takeover  demo.   At TRSAC 3
they  won  the  intro competition with
their  4k  intro simply called Faar K.
They  released the intro The Castle at
Mekka Symposium and came second in the
compo  there.   They  also released an
oldskool  demo  at the Trsac FU called
Kunto,  in  addition  to the demo Dark
Rain and the intro Slap Yourself Silly
at the Compusphere XIII party.
