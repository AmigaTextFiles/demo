»CL1:I  have been working on establishing a
demoscene for MorphOS.  There has been
exchanging  ideas  and  general  talks
about  it between me, Genesi and a few
others.

I  don't  know  how up to date you are
with Genesi/MorphOS/Pegasos issues, or
even   interested.    However,  I  was
contacted  by Genesi a couple of weeks
ago  to  handle something interesting,
to    help    bring    demoscene   for








MorphOS/Pegasos.   Already I have been
away and getting away more and more of
demoscene,  but  I  naturally  agreed.
What a way to have new life to already
dying interest in demoscene, huh?

The  main  thing  is,  that Genesi has
approved    my    idea    of   LOANING
Pegasos-computers    for   demosceners
willing  to do an intro, or a demo for
MOS.  I myself has targeted the ending
of  loan  to  Assembly  2003.  I think
there's   enough   time   to  work  on
something.

Here is a portion of a Genesi email: 

3. If you are a Demo Scener: 

Contact  bbrv@genesi.lu directly as we
are     coordinating    this    effort
ourselves.    Approved   Sceners   are
eligible    for    complete   systems,
including  case,  hard  drive, memory,
etc.  

So,  if you are willing to make a demo
or intro, let's say for Assembly 2003,
you  may get a Pegasos for yourself to
develop it on!  More information about
the computer itself and its Amiga-like
operation           system          at

»CL1:Send     email     to    mr.Buck    to
bbrv@genesi.lu  with  a  little bit of
information  saying you're interested.
Then  maybe provide an url where there
is  some  examples  of  previous work,
which  proves  why  YOU  should  get a
Pegasos.

Finally, you may point your browser to
http://www.morphzone.org/

Here  we will have a private forum for
demosceners.   Getting access to it is
done  by  me.   Either  send  email to
hooligan@phnet.fi  with your login and
given email.  Or you can bug me on irc
@ ircnet, I go by name of thg^dcs.
I  will  grant  access  and notify you
back by email.

For  the  first time, _everybody_ will
be  competiting starting from the same
place!
 
For   questions   that   need   to  be
answered,  use  my  email.   I am more
than happy to help as much as I can.
