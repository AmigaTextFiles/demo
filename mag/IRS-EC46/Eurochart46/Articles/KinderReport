                                 Introduction
 
»CL1:After   the   Kindergarden  party  got
delayed  for  some months, I was happy
to  get  on an airplane heading in the
direction of the party place.

The  Kindergarden  party  was  finally
held  between the 28th of February and
2nd  of  March  2003  at Haga, a small
place    many    miles    outside   of
Oslo/Norway.










This years edition of the Kindergarden
party  called, #%00001010, is the 10th
Kindergarden  party,  so naturally the
organizers  wanted  to  celebrate  the
anniversary.

While  the  Gathering  Party held each
eastern in Norway is the world largest
computer  event,  that  party can't be
compared  to  the  Kindergarden  party
when  it  comes to atmosphere.  Before
all the norwegian sceners were present
at  the Gathering parties, now all the
creative  sceners  choose to visit the
Kindergarden parties instead.

The Kindergarden party is a pure scene
event,  and  no  gamers  were found at
this  years  edition either.  However,
the last 3 years (including this year)
people  from  other computer platforms
than  the  Amiga, have been allowed to
attend.  This year for instance, there
were sceners from the Amiga scene, the
C64  scene, the Atari scene and the PC
scene at the least.

»CL8:              Facilities

»CL1:The  party-hall  could house up to 100
people  when  considering  that  there
should  be  a  table  and  a chair for
everyone.  This year there were plenty
of  space  as  "only"  61 sceners were
registered  participating  the  party.
However,  I do think a few more people
actually  were  present  for some time
without being registrated.

In  the  party-hall there was a stage,
and  the  entertainment was being held
up  there.   The good moderator of KG,
Pinocchio/Contraz,  also delivered all
the messages from the stage.

A  temporary kitchen was set up in the
hall  also.   It  was  possible to buy
cold  drinks  such as cola, sprite and
fanta  for  10 Norwegian Kroner NOK (1
Euro  =  7,70  NOK),  and coffee for 5
NOK.   It  was  also possible to buy a
whole pizza for 50 N0K or half a pizza
for 25 NOK, in addition to waffles for
5  NOK.   These  prices  are  actually
quite   cheap   compared   to   normal
norwegian prices.

There  was  a  separate sleeping-room,
which could perhaps house 20-30 people
at  the  same  time.   It was warm and
comfortable,  but  it didn't manage to
keep out the noise from the main-hall.
Besides,  people were also sleeping in
the  basement  were  it  was much more
quiet.  The toilets were also situated
in  the  basement, and they were quite
ok.

This  year the Kindergarden party also
offered showers.  That is, the showers
were  located  in a building around 10
kilometers  away from the party place.
The  showers  were also only available
on  Saturday  between 12.00 and 16.00,
but  at  least  offered  lots  of warm
water.

There's  really  not that much more to
mention about the facilities.

    »CL8:          The Party

»CL1:The  majority  of sceners present were
from  the  Amiga demo scene and the PC
scene,  but  there  were  also  a  few
people from the C64 and Atari scene.

Even  though there were less people at
the   Kindergarden  party  this  year,
compared  to  the  previous  year, the
atmosphere  was  really  great.  About
the  entire active Amiga demo scene of
Norway   were  present  at  the  party
place.    There   were   sceners  from
Apathy,     Contraz,    DCS,    Depth,
Ephidrena,   Gods,  Massive,  Haujobb,
Silents, Spaceballs and Squirrelz.  In
addition  to this, there were at least
two  foreign  sceners.   A  girl named
Maritsa and Kufa/Scarab & Scoopex.

Talking about girls, during the entire
party  I  counted  that  there  were 7
girls   that   decided   to  drop  by.
However,   there  were  only  3  girls
present  during the entire party.  But
this   is   quite   much  compared  to
previous parties.

There  were  various entertainments at
the  stage.   Some demos were shown at
the  big  screen, and some movies too.
There were also two Djs playing music,
Nike/TRSI    and    Xhale/DCS&Haujobb.
Because of the 10th anniversary of KG,
there were also lots of ballons spread
around   everywhere.    There   was  a
"stage-compo"  as  well, where the aim
was to entertain, hehe.
The  sceners were enjoying themselves;
working  on productions, chatting with
eachother,  drinking  as  alcohol  was
allowed  inside  the party-place.  The
atmosphere   was   quite  relaxed  and
friendly.

The only negative aspects of the party
this  year,  is that we had a few very
short powerfailures.  There also was a
firealarm which led to the entire hall
being   evacuated   for  some  minutes
before    the    fire-department   was
contacted.   Anyway, there was no fire
at  all.   Also one person went to the
hospital   because   of   an  allergic
reaction  to  something he ate (nuts).
The  ambulance  took  care of him, and
later on he returned to the party.


    »CL8:      The contributions

»CL1:There  were  not many contributions at
this party, and I'll only focus on the
Amiga releases.

First  of  all,  the last issue of the
old  digital  magazine  D.I.S.C.   was
released  by  Gods & IRIS.  This small
party-edition  which  is  issue 14, is
also said to be the very last issue of
this  legendary  magazine.   There was
also  made  an  intro for D.I.S.C.  at
the  party  place,  it  was created by
Scarab.

When   it   comes   to   the   various
competitions  with  Amiga  entries,  I
first  have to mention the combined 4k
and  64k  intro  for Amiga & PC.  Void
released  a 4k-intro called "Bobshow",
and   Apathy   in  coop  with  UpRough
released a 64k-intro called "Haakan".

In the demo competition, Mawi released
a  PPC  demo called "Till I Feel You",
Ephidrena  released a classic 68k demo
called   "Lysbryter",  and  Spaceballs
also  released  a  classic demo called
The Plague.

You  can  read a small review of these
productions in a separate article.

In  the  other competitions with Amiga
contributions,  like  the  chip  music
competition,  Zixaq/Ephidrena won with
the           song          "Rattata",
Rolex/Depth&Massive  came  second with
"Drugsmall"        together       with
Frequent/Ephidrena   with   his   song
"Repeating    X",   and   third   came
Maze/Apathy with "The Bompy Song".  In
the  high  quality  music  compo, a PC
scener  won,  but  Slumgud/Depth&Razor
1911 came second with "Luftvaffel".  A
PC scener managed to come third, while
Frequent/Ephidrena   came   4th   with
"Vikeplikt".     In   the   wild-compo
Contraz  won,  Depth  came  second and
Ephidrena had to share the third place
with  a  PC  group.   I  also  have to
mention  that  Slummy/Spaceballs  also
participated  in  the  C64 compo under
another groupname.  However, he didn't
manage  to  win.   The  group Creators
did.



    »CL8:         End remarks

»CL1:This  edition  of  the  KG  party  was
definately  a  success.   It's a great
scene   event   done  for  sceners  by
sceners.

At   13.00  hours  the  last  day  the
prize-cermony  was held.  Unlike other
parties,  the  prizes  aren't  much to
talk  about.   The important thing for
the  sceners are to compete with other
sceners for honour and pride.  Despite
this,    some   T-shirts,   Demo-DVDs,
hardware and software were given away,
along  with many pornmovies.  And even
more  original were prices as food and
something to drink...  :-) All winners
also  got  a  colourful diploma, which
confirmed them to be the winners.

The  releases of this party was just a
bonus really, but I guess we got quite
an  ok  number  of  releases  thinking
about  how  few sceners that attended.
And a few of these releases were quite
good  too.   I have to mention that it
can   be   questionable  if  Ephidrena
deserved  to win the demo compo.  They
won  with  a  lousy 1 point over Mawi,
and  you  could  say Ephidrena had the
advantage  of  showing a demo in their
native  country.   But then again, the
Mawi  demo  was  made  on  PPC and the
Ephidrena demo wasn't!

At  the  end  I  have to say that some
parts  of this article have previously
been released in AmigaPlus 03/2003.
