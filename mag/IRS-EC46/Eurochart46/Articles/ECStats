»CL8:                        Written by Darkhawk of IRIS

»CL1:Hello  and  welcome  to this statistic
article,  which  is mindnumbingly dull
to  make (as was the Survey thingie, I
assure  you), but which is nonetheless
a  nice gimmick once it has been done.
Here  we  take  a  look  at  where you
voting  sceners  come  from,  both  in
terms of countries and groups.

However,  after  getting  flamed  last
time, for misplacing one person in one
country,  I  must write that naturally
this  is  based  on my own assumptions







and  knowledge pertaining to where the
people    who    vote    are    placed
geographically.   In  a  way, I feel I
know  the  entire  scene,  and each of
you,    but   errors   might   happen,
naturally.   If  they do, and you find
out, you are very welcome to write me,
and  point this out..  Preferably in a
polite way..

Alright,  this was the disclaimer, now
let's  see  how  you  are  placed,  in
regards to countries this time around.
»CLA:Norway                              21

»CL8:Poland                              19       

»CL0:Germany                             16      

»CL1:Denmark                             15

»CL7:Finland                              9       
Sweden                               9       

England                              4       
Netherlands                          4       

Russia                               3       

Hungary                              2
Italy                                2       

Austria                              1       
France                               1
USA                                  1       

»CL1:This  time  around,  Denmark  has gone
down,  terms  of  voters, while Poland
and    Norway    storms   ahead,   not
surprising,  given  the  size  of  the
scene   in   those  countries.   Other
countries  are  well  represented  too
this  time.   All in all, it is a good
indication  on how big the scene is in
the different countries.

And  now,  let's see which groups were
the  best  voters.  As you might know,
there  is  a prize involved, as I will
hand  out  free beer to the group with
the most voters at the next party I am
attending.   That  will  be Breakpoint
2003  naturally,  as  this  mag should
hopefully get released there.  Anyway,
let's see..

»CL1:Aww crap...  Apathy managed to collect
more votes from members than IRIS did.
As  a  result,  Flower  and Nutman are
close  to  getting kicked out of IRIS,
for   not   voting,   hrmff.   Anyway,
congratulations   are   in  order  for
Apathy,  and  I  hope  you will try to
surpass IRIS the next time around too.
Other  groups  are  also very welcome,
although  I  doubt  many could collect
more  than  12  votes,  seeing  as how
almost  no  group  is  that  big these
days..   Ohh well, I will go find Leia
here at the Breakpoint today, and give
her some beer.  She is the only member
of  Apathy  here,  so I escaped rather
easily..  THIS time!
Ok,  that's  all  from  here, over and
out!
