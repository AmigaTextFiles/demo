»CL1:It's  time  to  update my scene-report
»CL1:and  thereby  remove  all the dead and
inactive  groups.  This time I'll only
focus   on   the  active  groups  that
manages  to  come  up  with  an  Amiga
production  now  and then.  This means
that   I'll   also  skip  groups  with
members  who  aren't  able  to come up
with  productions  on  their  own,  or
making  mainly  non-Amiga productions.
The   result   should   be  that  this
scene-report  cover  the active forces
of  the  small norwegian scene!  So if







you  miss  your  group among the teams
mentioned  in  this report, then start
getting active on Amiga!


»CL8:               APATHY

»CL1:-  The  group  has  produced  lots  of
productions  during  the latest years,
from  intros  and demos, to musicdisks
and packs.  At the Gathering party two
years  ago  Apathy managed to come 2nd
in  the  intro  competition with their
AHA-Remix.   They  also  released  the
demo  Wormhole  at The Mekka-Symposium
party   that   year,  and  the  Polish
members  released the slideshow Klimat
at  the  Kindergarden party last year.
They released Digital Chips 31 in July
2002.    At   the  Kindergarden  party
nearly  two  months ago, they released
the intro Haakan in coop with UpRough.

»CL8:               CONTRAZ

»CL1:-  Contraz  has  been  one of the best
norwegian  teams the latest years with
many  releases; both intros and demos.
I    first   noticed   them   at   the
Gathering'95,  and  afterwards they've
improved  quite  much.  The group is a
result  of  two  crews joining forces;
NSS and Black Spiders, and some of the
members  have  been sceners for a real
long  time.   The latest releases I've
seen  were  from  the  Gathering party
last year and the Kindergarden Invitro
released  in  February this year.  The
also organized the Kindergarden party.
Contraz  will  also  release a demo at
the  Gathering  party  which  is being
held  now.   Accede  is  making a game
called  Civtarion  under  the Trilobit
Microsoftware label.

»CL8:                DEPTH

»CL1:-  Tbey  have  been  in  Norway  since
around  1994  I think.  The last Amiga
production  I  saw  from  them was the
dentro  Arcane  Lugter released at the
Kindergarden  party last year.  It was
done  in  cooperation  with the Danish
members.   But  they  also  released a
contribution  in the wild compo at the
Kindergarden  party  this year, it was
called Playdoh Mansion.

Well-Known Members:  Allanon, Sprocket
and Slumgud.


»CL8:              EPHIDRENA

»CL1:-  This  is the leading norwegian team
these  days  after  the  departure  of
Andromeda, perhaps in some competition
with   groups   like   Spaceballs  and
Contraz.   They  are  also  one of the
leading   international  groups  these
days.   Ephidrena  got  founded in mid
1995,  and  have  been very active the
latest  years  with  lots of demos and
intros.  Their big breakthrough got to
be  with  the winning Concrete demo at
the  Party  9,  but  of course they've
also  made some great intros that have
done  good  at  various  parties.  The
last  release  I saw from them was the
demo   Lysbryter   released   at   the
Kindergarden  this  year.   It won the
competition.   Rumours  are indicating
Ephidrena   will   come   up   with  a
production   here  at  the  Breakpoint
party.

Well-Known   Productions:   J,  Pluss,
Abiotic,   Byte,   Bier,  Beer,  Brus,

»CL8:                GODS

»CL1:-  This  group got founded in 1994 and
was very active the next 3 years.  The
latest  years  they have not been very
active  on  Amiga.  The norwegian side
of  this crew was probably at its best
around   1995.   They  were  behind  a
certain  diskmag  called D.I.S.C.  and
some slideshows.  The demos and intros
were  mainly done by the French coders
in   cooperation  with  the  norwegian
graphicians.   In any case, DISC 14 in
coop   with   IRIS   released  at  the
Kindergarden   party  this  year,  was
their latest release so far.

Homepage:  www.idf.net/gods

Well-Known  Productions:   D.I.S.C,  A
Few Good Men and Divine.

Well-Known Members:  Bridgeclaw, Dran,
Punisher, Typhoon and Zerox.


»CL8:               SCENIC

»CL1:- This is a new group founded by Fusko
and Pix last year.  It's quite special
as  it  only  consists of graphicians.
The  group  will mainly cooperate with
other   groups  and  make  the  entire
design  in  productions  for them.  At
the  moment  Scenic is also working on
slideshows,  both on Amiga and PC.  It
was  supposed  to  be  released at the
Mekka-Symposium   last  year,  but  is
still not out I think.


Well-Known  Members:  Fusko, Orome and
Pix.

»CL8:             SPACEBALLS

»CL1:-  This  is a legendary crew which got
founded back in 1989.  It has had lots
of  famous  members, like Dark Helmet,
Lone  Starr,  Lord  Helmet, Vinnie and
Major  Asshole  to  mention a few.  It
has  also  released  lots  of  quality
demos  during this period, most famous
are  probably  Wayfarer,  State Of The
Art,  RAW  and  9 Fingers.  The latest
years  they have been even more active
with Slummy as the coding-force behind
all productions.  They've won the demo
compo at the Gathering Party amazingly
4  times!   The  last  production from
them  so  far,  is the demo The Plague
released  at  the  Kindergarden  party
this  year.  Some more productions are
expected  from them either here at the
Breakpoint  party  or at the Gathering
party.

»CL8:               SPECTER

»CL1:-  This  is a group consisting only of
norwegian   members.    However,  most
members  are  double or triple-members
and  some  are using different handles
in  this  group.   Nevertheless,  Lost
Puppy  4  and  Bubble  are  among  the
releases   under  the  Specter  label.
More  releases  are  expected  in  the
future.

Well-Known  Members:   Chauple,  Leia,

»CL8:              SQUIRRELZ

»CL1:-  This  is  a  very special team.  In
addition to being something so rare as
a new group in the norwegian scene, it
also  contains only females.  However,
the  only  Amiga productions I've seen
from  them  so  far,  were Rabb-It and
Spinner.  But those were obviously not
done  by them, hehe...  At the Trsac 3
party  they  released the wilddemo The
Obstacle Test, and at the Kindergarden
party  this year they released another
contribution in the wildcompo.

Well-Known  Members:   Alv,  Leia  and
Peaky.


»CL8:                VOID

»CL1:-  According  to my knowledge the only
norwegian member of this group, is now
Rumrummer.   And  it  seems like he is
back  in business again.  In any case,
he   has   released  the  mag  Saxonia
earlier  this  year  and also released
the    4k-intro    Bobflow    at   the
Kindergarden  party  nearly two months
ago.

Well-Known Member:  Rumrummer.
