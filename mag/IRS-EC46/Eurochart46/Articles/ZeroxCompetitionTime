»CL8:                          Written by Zerox of Gods

»CL1:As  D.I.S.C.   died peacefully the 1st
of  March  this  year, I've decided to
move  the  various competitions to the
EuroChart.   So  in every issue of the
EuroChart  we're  going to give away a
nice  prize  in  our easy competition.
Usually  only  a few sceners bother to
take  part in any kind of competition,
and therefore there's a BIG chance for
you  to  be  the lucky winner.  In the
last  competition  for instance only 1
scener  managed  to  answer correctly.








Therefore  I  recommend  everybody  to
take  part  and  have  some  FUN.  The
winner  will  be announced in the next
issue  of  the  EuroChart  and get the
prize by mail.

Now...   what  can  you win this time?
Well,  I  continue  to  give away some
cool  prizes  and this time it's Scene
Explorer  2  which  is the main prize.
It  should  be  a collectors ithem for
all  sceners,  hehe...  This CD-ROM is
packed   with  various  contents.   It
includes  over  1  gigabyte  of packed
demos, graphics, modules etc.

In  addition  to  that, I know many of
you out there also have a PC which you
use  to  play games on.  Therefore the
winner  of  this competition will also
win  a  CD  with  the game Rise Of The
Triad. In this package the Instruction
Manual  is of course included as well.
The  requirements are real low, so the
game should work on most PCs.

This time we just repeat the questions
in the D.I.S.C.  13 competition, as no
one  have  managed to answer correctly
yet.   So no need for you to stay away
from this cool compo.  According to my
knowledge this is the only competition
with a decent prize too.  Here are the
few   simple  questions  you  have  to
answer:

QUESTIONS  FOR  THE COMPETITION IN THE
EUROCHART 46:

»CL6:1.  How    many    times   have    the
    Mekka-Symposium party been held?

»CL7:2.  What's the name of the winner demo
    of Mekka-Symposium 2002?

»CL6:3.  From which  country do the members
    of Flopi come from?

»CL7:4.  Which  group  released   the  demo
    called Muscles?


»CL6:5.   At  which  party  did  the  intro
     Dolphins Dream get released?

»CL1:If  you know the answers of these real
easy  questions, then send them to the
following address:

Frode Hansen
Grannes Terrasse 37
4044 HAFRSFJORD
NORWAY

Or   simply   send   an   e-mail   to:
zerox@post.com

All   participants  with  the  correct
answers  will  get  one piece of paper
with their name on placed in a bucket,
and  I'll draw the winner.  The winner
will  of course get the prizes free of
charge  directly  in the mail.  That's
it!
