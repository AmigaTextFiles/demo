»CL1:Earlier  this week, the 16th of April,
Petro   Tyschtschenko  celebrated  his
60th  birthday.   Naturally  we in the
EuroChart       send      out      our
congratulations!

Petro  Tyschtschenko  has been working
with Commodore/Amiga for 20 years, and
has  done an incredible job during all
these  years.   He  began  working for
Commodore  back  in  October 1982, and
due  to  financial  problems  for  the
developer  teams, it brought Commodore







into  the  Amiga  family  in 1984.  In
1985  when  the  first  Amiga  saw the
light of day, Petro was a team member.
And  after that the Amiga has become a
major part of the life of Petro.

Petro  Tyschtschenko  has  during  all
these     years     experienced    two
bankruptcies  (Commodore  and  Escom),
and  four  companies (Commodore-Amiga,
Inc.   (1984-1994), AMIGA Technologies
GmbH (1995-1996), AMIGA International,
Inc.    (1997-2001)  and  AMIGA,  Inc.
(from 1997 with the buy through AMINO,
Inc.  since 2000).

When  Commodore  went bankrupt back in
1994,  Petro  was  the logisticmanager
who became the liquidator who traveled
across  the world to close the various
divisions.   But  he  saw a future for
our beloved computer, and tried to get
investors to continue the development.
At  the end he found Escom, who bought
the  rights  to  Amiga  and  founded a
daughtercompany      called      AMIGA
Technologies.    By   1996  Escom  got
financial   difficulties,   and  Petro
tried  to get a new investor.  In 1997
Gateway  2000  bought  the rights, and
AMIGA    Technologies   became   AMIGA
International,  Inc.   with  Petro  as
chief.   In 1998 PowerPC-CPUs got out,
and  in  1999  AmigaOS version 3.5 got
released.  None of this would probably
have  happened  without  Petro and his
strong belief in the Amiga.

Anyway,  Jim  Collas  in  Gateway took
over  with  his visions.  However, not
much  happened,  and  suddenly  he was
gone.    Nothing   happened  with  the
succesor   Thomas  Schmidt.   In  2001
AMINO  Development, Inc, got the Amiga
rights.   In  April  that  year  Petro
Tyschtschenko  left AMIGA Inc., but he
is     still     active     for    the
user-community.

What's  left  to say:  Congratulations
Petro with your 60th birthday from the
Amiga-community!
