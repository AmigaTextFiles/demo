»CL8:                            Credits For Issue 46
»PIC:barclip.ilbm»

»CL1:Once  again we released the Eurochart,
and  once  again  I  type the credits.
Let's not waste any time, but go right
over to the juicy bits..

As  always,  the  code is the same old
code,  that performs quite flawlessly,
and it was done by Quedax of Depth.

The titlepicture for this issue of the
EC  was done by Paracels from Placebo,
and  the  panels  were  made by Yon of
IRIS.   The  cliparts  for  this issue
were done by:






»CL7:         Da Freak of RNO&Lqs
         Darklight of Veezya
           Dr. Doom of IRIS

»CL1:Looking  at,  or  rather  hearing  the 
music,  you're  listening  to  one  of
three  modules  included.   These are:
"Everything's  fine" by Mice of Zenon,
a  relaxing  tune,  which lends itself
very well to reading.  The second tune
included  is  "Umbrella  days man", by
Jazzcat   of  Appendix&PSL.   And  the
third   is   "Back   to   basics"   by
Zandax/Damage,  a tune composed solely
with  the  old  ST samples, so I guess
the  oldtimers  amongst  you will take
note.

But  now  for  the mag content of this
issue.  We feature articles written by
the following people:

»CL7:            Adonis of IRIS
           Darkhawk of IRIS
         Fishwave of Scoopex
       Lahve of Scoopex&Reason
         Paracels of Placebo
         The Hooligan of DCS
            Zerox of Gods

»CL1:Looking  at  the  slavelabour  side of
things,    Adonis    colourized    and
formatted  the articles, Hobbitten and
Darkhawk    spellchecked    (I    hate
spellchecking!),  Ransom  and Darkhawk
made  the  gallery, Adonis counted the
votes,   and   Darkhawk   labouriously
entered the info into the Votecounter,
aswell  as  counting  the Scene Survey
entries.

But there is one outside of the staff,
who deserves a special mention:  Kempy
of   DCS  and  Veezya  did  a  lot  of
freelance work for us.  He updated the
info  in  our  votecounter,  collected
votes   and   much  of  our  (not  too
impressive)  news.   Well, he did even
more,  but let's just say a huge thank
you  to  Kempy,  and  we  hope he will
support  us  like  that  in the future
too!

Well,  that's it for this issue.  Take
care  out there, and please support us
in  the  future..   Pretty please with
sugar on top.
