»CL0:Next  issue..  Next issue will be out
when  it  will  be out.  No more.  no
less.   It certainly won't get out in
3  months  time,  but  anything after
that is a fair bet.  »CL8:We must face the
facts  that we set a deadline for you
people, »CL0: and  nothing happens, unless
we ourselves are heavily into forcing
you  to  keep  it.  If we do this, we
waste  our own lives in those months,
and   that's   not   too  stimulating
either.   So,  in  the  future, we're
going to work as usual on the EC, and







give  it  our  all  when  the time is
ready.  Nothing more, nothing less.

Your  task now, upon reading this, is
to  decide what you can do to support
us,  and  then  do  it.   »CL7:Do not wait
until  we  contact  you, vote, write,
compose  ,  send us gfx. »CL0: The rate of
release,  coupled  with  the level of
quality  depends  more on you than on
us.    If   we  have  enough  quality
material to fill an issue of the EC 3
months after the last, we'll work our
asses  off  and  do it, we just don't
want  to  spend  3 months working our
asses off AND collect support.

»CL8:So..    the   EC  issue  47  will  be
released  when  it's  ready.  »CL0:Stay in
touch  with  us  via mail and IRC, to
know  the more exact date.  We're not
going  to  rest  now,  we'll  keep on
preparing  the  EC  as usual, we just
don't  want  to give out any deadline
for  support  anymore, since that one
is never realistic.
