    »CL8:                        Written by Adonis of IRIS

»CL1:Yes  I am not going to blame the scene
for  anything  in this article; I will
attack  the  groups instead and give a
few   opinions   that  have  not  been
revealed  at  this  point  as far as I
know.

How  often  have  you  not  heard some
scener  complaining  that the scene is
dead   and   you   might  as  well  do
something else than spending your time
on  the  Amiga?  I am pretty sure that








most  of  you  have  heard that in the
past.

But  I actually think that this is not
the  whole  truth,  if  I  have  to be
honest.  As we all know it is not many
who  can  make  a  production  if  the
coders   are  not  motivated  to  code
something.    The  graphicians  cannot
release   slideshows;   the  musicians
cannot release musicdisk etc.

Can  we  really  blame  the coders for
making the single scener inactive?  We
can if we want to be hard on them, but
there  are  ways  to make sure that it
does not happen.

If  we catch the coder at a time where
he is in a good mood and ready to kick
some ass, then you should set down and
start  to  make something new and this
new  production  should  be  something
that  can  be reused several times and
not  only  used once.  The code has to
be  simple, and should be made so that
it  can be changed by the graphicians,
editors  or  musicians.  The thing you
can  prevent by doing this is that the
few  members  you  have  in your group
which  are  more  active than the rest
will  always  have something to do and
can  release things if they want to on
their own.

I know that you might say that this is
not  the  way  to  do it, and that you
want  to  make something special every
time  and  if you have enough time and
enough  active  members  for that then
you  should  go  for  it and make that
special  design, and put a lot of work
in it, since that is for sure the best
thing you can do, but the other way to
do  it is just to prevent more in your
group to go inactive.

The  inactives  kill the active people
and drag them down in the dirt.

Yes that is a fact and I know for sure
that they really do not want to do it,
but  it  simply  just  happens and you
cannot do that much about it.  You can
try  to  motivate  the people who drag
you  down  and  you  can  try  to  get
something released on your own.

But  a  team  of friends is still more
fun  to  work  with  and  it will most
likely  give  the  best result in most
cases.
One  thing  people should keep in mind
is  that  some people have been around
for over 10 years by now and they have
tried   so  much  and  are  harder  to
motivate since they do it for pure fun
and  not  many do it for fame anymore,
since they have managed to be or still
are  the  top  and they do not have do
that  much  to  stay  there, since the
competition is not that hard anymore.

I  am  pretty sure that this is also a
thing  that  de-motivates people, they
simply  do  not  have  to fight for it
anymore,  they  might  have  had their
battles  and  won,  but these days are
over  now.   In the past you were fast
forgotten if you did not work hard all
the time.

So  there  is a simple and easy way to
make  things  a little better and that
is  to  produce some easy productions,
which  can  be  released  anytime  the
publisher   has  the  spirit  and  the
motivation  for it.  He/she should not
have  to  wait  for the code, music or
graphic  to  come first and then maybe
loose   the   motivation   before   it
arrives.

I  guess that I will get some feedback
on this topic since I will most likely
touch  some  coders and some will most
likely  say  that  I  am  right  while
others  have  something  else to tell.
Maybe  some  organizers  will disagree
with  me  too,  about  the  motivation
part,  since  I  know  that some think
that  it is your duty to motivate your
group  mates.   This  is  a thing that
also  can be discussed, so I will rush
on to the next article and write about
that.
