»CL1:Ahehmm..  This is not at all good..  I
really  tried,  y'know?   But it seems
that  fate is inevitable.  For some EC
issues,   we  have  run  the  reliable
swappers  chart.   That  chart sort of
died  last  time,  when  there  was no
support  for  it.   Instead, I started
the swappers corner, that was supposed
to  be  a living forum, where swappers
wrote  what they thought of, and where
we   might   have   some   stimulating
discussions..








Well  well,  only Lahve supported this
corner,  and  his article isn't at all
positive.    Indeed,   none   of   you
swappers  out  there  commented  on my
huge  article  about  how  we  had  to
change  our  profession  if we were to
survive.   Not  that you had to agree,
but  you  could at least have reacted,
and   written   for   or  against  it.
Instead,  all  we have now is silence.
As if the remains of the swapper scene
couldn't  even manage a reply, showing
that  they're  not close to their last
breaths.    So,   I   am  left  a  bit
bewildered..  What to do now?  Declare
swapping  dead  and gone for real this
time?   No,  I would be very reluctant
to  do  that,  to be the one to do it,
but I think that if I did, I might get
away  with it, the mail-swapping scene
is that dead, I think.

Remember  when  Curt  Cool  and Cytron
tried  to remove the swappers chart in
the  EC?  That was years ago, but they
thought  swapping  was  a thing of the
past  back then.  Luckily we all wrote
in  to them, threatened boykot, aswell
as other, less pleasant things, and we
actually  succeeded  in  bringing back
the  chart..  Since then, the swappers
chart  has  been  there,  more or less
accurate,    mostly    with   inactive
swappers on the top, and certainly not
with 20 working swappers on it.  Now I
think  we  are  very close to actually
dropping the chart, finally.  However,
I  won't  do  that  until  swapping is
indeed declared dead.

Is  this  what you need to get up from
your grave and react?  Please tell me,
that there are some concerned swappers
out   there,   who  want  to  continue
swapping,  and who want to support the
scene?   Please  make the world and me
aware  of  your  continued  existence,
because as far as I can see, there are
not   even  10  active  swappers  left
anymore..  This is indeed a sub-scene,
ehehm..

Anyway,  please, let me see some signs
of  life  from  you,  the swappers, or
else  the  next  issue  of the EC will
have  to  take the consequences of the
silence..   And  this  is  no  threat,
because  I certainly do not want to do
this,  if  there's any hope.  We shall
see..

In  any  case, read the support we did
get,  and  then  act  yourself, if you
want to see this corner continue.
