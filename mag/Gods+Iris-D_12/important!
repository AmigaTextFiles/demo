                              I S S U E  # 12

               One year has passed...
              
               - The D.I.S.C Team became divided, as several
                 people decided not to support the mag.
               - The editing work went back to Zerox after some
                 months of delay.
               - But despite of that, the remaining team members
                 continued the hard work...
               - As a result of this, we proudly present another
                 issue of Digital Information Service for Computer-
                 freaks.
               - Since last time, the code has been improved. Now
                 we can use theorethically up to 256 colours cliparts.
               - The bug that made the mag crash when using the arrows
                 where there were links, is now removed.

               ...so how to make D.I.S.C. #12 run?
                 
               - First of all, take the entire DISC archieve and copy it
                 into a seperate directory. DO NOT change the names of
                 any of the directories, as it's essential that the gfx,
                 music etc. are to be found there. Then copy all the FONTS
                 to your usual font directory (like DH0:fonts) OR simply
                 assign the fonts into your DISC-archieve directory.
               
               - Hopefully it should work now, if not, PLEASE contact the
                 D.I.S.C. Team!
