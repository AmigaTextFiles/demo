«c7»As promised in the last issue of D.I.S.C, we would introduce some «c6»fresh
charts «c7»for you. However, due to us not wanting to beg for votes at
«c6»#amigascne «c7»or other channels, and as we don't have an online voting site
either, we didn't get that many votes. Infact, we only got about «c6»half of
the votes as in ShowTime. «c7»Because of this, we sadly announce that these
charts presented in issue 12 of D.I.S.C. will be the last ordinary charts.
With 100 votes or less we can never be sure if any charts are somewhat
representable of the scene or not. Therefore it's better to close the D.I.S.C.
charts, and leave it up to the «c6»EuroChart «c7»to present some decent charts.«»
