«as»«c7»In every issue of D.I.S.C. we're going to give away a «c6»nice prize «c7»in our
easy competition. In the future this competition will perhaps be under
a new corner planned to be called Zero Gravity. Usually only a few sceners
bother to take part in any kind of competition, and therefore there's a
BIG chance for you to be the «c6»lucky winner. «c7»In the last competition for
instance only 1 scener managed to answer correctly. Therefore I recommend
everybody to take part and have some «c6»FUN. «c7»The winner will be announced in
the next issue of «c6»D.I.S.C. «c7»and get the prize by mail.«»

Now... what can you win this time? Well, I continue to give away «c6»classic
CU Amiga CD-Roms, «c7»and this time it's «c6»Super CD-ROM 9 «c7»which is the main
prize. It should be a collectors ithem for all sceners, hehe...
This CD-ROM is packed with various contents. It includes full program of
Directory Opus 5.0, Turbo Print 5 demo, PC Task 4 demo, alot of things from
the Party 96, MUI 3.7, MPeg Audio, Tiny Troops playable demo, StrangersAGA,
MagicMenu, Toyland Capers, STFax, GMPlay, Utilities galore etc.«»

In addition to that, I know many of you out there also have a PC which you
use to play games on. Therefore the winner of this competition will also
win a CD with the game «c6»Terminal Velocity. «c7»In this package the Intruction Manual
is  of course included as well. The requirements are real low, so the game
should work on most PCs.«»
So no need for you to stay away from this cool compo. According
to my knowledge this is the only competition with a decent prize too. Here are
the «c6»few simple questions «c7»you have to answer:«»
