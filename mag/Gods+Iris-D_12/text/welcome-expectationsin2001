«as»In the last issue of «c5»D.I.S.C. «c1»I asked 5 sceners about their expectations
towards the amiga and the scene in the year 2001. This time I wanted to
know if their expectations had been fulfilled. However,
«c5»Zito/DARKAGE «c1»didn't reply to my emails... therefore you'll
only get the short remarks from «c5»Curt Cool, Darkhawk, Ghandy «c1»and «c5»Punisher.«»

«as»«c7»"I expect so. But actually giving a proper answer would involve actually
remembering, what I expected the first time. Which I, needless to say,
don't."«»

«as»«c7»"In my opinion they have been fullfilled, as the scene still keeps going, and
there have been some new people joining the scene. Despite all the complaining
around, I'm still optimistic regarding the future of our beloved community.
Let us cheer together for the glory which will come in 2002!"«»

«as»«c7»"Yes, the Amiga demoscene still exists and goes strong. The number of
people playing a role in any way is very low but the quality of
releases still satisfies me. With all our hardware limitations, with
the less people being active, it`s awesome what they have created!!«»
«»
«as»«c7»Of course they were also a lot of crappy releases but that was
always the case!"«»

«as»«c7»"Well, well, seems like I was a bit too careful in my Expectation lines for
the last DISC.. Yes, the diskmag scene had a nice year, as expected, but
there were also 20 Amiga demos released at the MS 2001, and I hadn't
expected that at all naturally, although it was way cool. Now, the year is
not over, but looking back now, there's really a lot to look back on...
diskmags, slideshows, chippacks, intros and especially demos. And the year
is not gone yet. As you read this, my group has released 2 chippacks, 3
diskmags, 2 demos (3 maybe, but this is as ever, uncertain ;)), 3 intros, 1
slideshow and an iconpack this year. Hehe, while we've been the most active
group around this year (I think? But respect to Gods, Darkage and Depth,
with whom we coproduced some of these prods) a LOT of other people released 
stuff, as you should know if you're collecting. Actually 2001 has been the 
best year looking at the quantity of scene releases since.. Well, since.. 
96' or 97' I think. And it isn't even over yet.. Very positive. Also, 
people are going back to OCS prods, aswell as 'forward' to PPC demos too, 
so we have both movements, even without a new Amiga. Wonderful, and I'm happy 
this year was more positive than I thought!"«»
