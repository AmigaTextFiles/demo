«as»«c7»During the last years, we have witnessed an explosion when it comes to
«c6»emulating the Amiga «c7»computer on an ordinary PC. There are several
different kinds of programs that copes with running Amiga programs very
well on the Microsoft box, but that of course does not interest us. What
interests us, is that it has made «c6»tons of old games and demos «c7»available on
the internet.«»
«»
At the moment, there are lot's of sites dedicated to games for the Amiga
emulators. The «c6»"Back To The Roots" «c7»site maintained by some members of
Haujobb, is a great example of how wide the softwarebase is. On this site
you can find plenty of «c6»old classics along with some newer titles. «c7»Many
people access the archives on daily bases, downloading stuff for their
emulator. There are plenty of other sites available, and to find them, you
can simply search for «c6»"Amiga emulators" «c7»at "Altavista" or a similar
search-engine.«»
«»
The games and programs are usually stored in «c6»"ADF" «c7»format, quite similar
to «c6»"DMS", «c7»stored in «c6»"ZIP" «c7»archives. To use "ADF" on the Amiga is no
problem, as there exists programs for unpacking, packing and handling it.
You simply port the software over to the Amiga, unpack the "ADF" file like
you unpack a DMS file, and you are «c6»up and going.«»

«c7»I'm quite excited about this emulator thing on the PC, but I can assume
that some of you out there are a bit negative on this matter, as it could
harm the Amiga community. In my opinion, it is a part of «c6»keeping the Amiga
alive. «c7»Giving the old software new life on other platforms also gives the
machine and the idea «c6»a rebirth. «c7»In the future, I hope to see more old
classic Amiga software being available for us, and that as many people as
possible will take «c6»advantage «c7»of it!«»
