«c1»«c7»Not much has changed since I wrote my last report one year ago.
Long gone are the old famous danish groups like «c6»Kefrens, Balance, Polka Brothers,
The Silents, Passion, Disaster and Impact «c7»to mention a few. And the "new"
heroes are «c6»Loonies, IRIS and Depth! «c7»The rest are rather inactive, so I'll just
concentrate on the familiar groups the latest time. The information below is
probably not 100% correct, so please send your information to correct me and update me.«»
«»
«ac»«c6»CROMATICS:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- The "new" Cromatics released a couple of productions, and Dansktoppen
was one of them. It was made in cooperation with Unique! They also arranged
the party TRSAC, but died short afterwards.«»

«ac»«c6»COPY&PASTE PRODUCTIONS:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- They first came to my attention at the Scene Meeting'99 when they released
an intro which came second. After that I can't say I've seen or heard anything from them.«»

«ac»«c6»DEPTH:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- The group got founded back in 1993 and most people know them because they
took over the EuroChart from Static Bytes, and have impressed by releasing
issue 28 to 43. The latest issues have been in cooperation with IRIS, which now have
taken over the mag entirely. Depth also have members
in Finland, Norway and England. They are known to do some crazy things
now and then. The member Curt Cool has started an ambitious project to gather
all scene-modules and composers in a BIG archive by the way. Help him! At
the Trsac 3 party Depth released the demo Bizzare Love Triangle in coop
with Haujobb and TRSI. The next release from Depth should be a new musicpack.«»

«as»«c7»- This is another fun-group which appeared at The Scene Meeting 2000 with the
mindblasting intro Pickles, hehe.
Nothing much to say about the group, just that it consists of some other members
in a group beginning of D.... :)«»
«»
«»
«»
«ac»«c6»EFREET:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- A small group which you don't hear from too often. But when you do, you know it's good.
The intro Deep Pan for instance had lots of good routines and a good precalculation of music.
The most famous member got to be the coder-wizard BlueBerry which is a double-member as he's
also in Loonies. They are often seen at the Danish parties.«»

«ac»«c6»GUNNARS FARVEBIO:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is a group which has existed for a very long time (perhaps the oldest
danish group that can be considered to be alive or...?). At least the group
got founded back in 1991, and have released many funny productions ever since.
The codework always seem to be good. The last time I saw something from them
was at the Trsac 3 party in the middle of October, where they released
Megademo $d.«»

«c5»Well-Known Member: «c2»Optima«»

«ac»«c6»IRIS:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is one of the oldest groups in the scene today. They have been very
active the latest years and released many quality productions. IRIS members
usually also attend many parties, and arrange the Scene Meeting themselves.
In addition to the Danish members, they have a few members in countries such
as Great Britain, Poland, Sweden and Norway.
They have taken over the EuroChart from Depth, and have
become a coop partner in D.I.S.C.. IRIS got to be one of the leading
danish crews and can also be considered to be a good group in international standard.
The latest releases in addition to D.I.S.C., is Noise From Heaven 3
released earlier this month, a 4k intro called
Kukabwlargh, released at TRSAC3 in the middle of October last year and the slideshow
The Puppets released in the middle of September. They're reported to be
working on a demo for the Mekka-Symposium party.«»

«ac»«c6»LOONIES:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This was a group which got founded nearly 7 years ago, and now has achieved to become
one of the very best groups at the scene. Especially the latest demos and a certain
musicdisk have got attention.
They are known to have some weird-style or deal with themes
in their productions, and are also present at most parties. I think all members
are from Denmark. They have also been very active lately, and won both the SM party and MS party
in 2000
with Cybercinematastic and Arla, in addition to the TRSAC2 with At The Movies demo.
At Mekka-Symposium last year they managed to come second with their
Hotstyle Takeover demo. The last amiga release from Loonies before the TRSAC
3 party, was the invitation intro to promote TRSAC 3. At TRSAC 3 they won the
intro competiton with their 4k intro simply called Faar K. And the last
release from Loonies on amiga so far, is the sample engine used in
Impossible and SuperDrug.«»

«ac»«c6»SCARAB:«»
«»
«as»«as»«c7»- This German based group has now also got a member in Denmark. It's
Puryx! His latest appearances were probably at the TRSAC 3 party where he came third in
the MP3 compo with the tune Undefined Universe, and at the Kindergarden
party with the module Fairylike.«»

«ac»«c6»SCOOPEX:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- Boogeyman left the scene. And Decoy is reported to be inactive, and
have now been removed from the Scoopex memberslist. I don't
know if there are any other members left or if they have released anything
lately. Optima left for Haujobb some years ago.«»
«»
«al»«c5»Well-Known Member: «c2»Decoy.«»
«»
«ac»«c6»SPOON:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is a group which got founded around early 1993 I think under the name
Transonic, but fast renamed to sPOOn. On Amiga it had its best days around
1994/95 with a few intro releases and their Sound musicdisk. After Christine
De La Queen left the scene, the group hasn't got so much attention. The
group is very small nowadays with 3 members I think, and the coder
Shayera is mostly making PC productions now I guess.«»
