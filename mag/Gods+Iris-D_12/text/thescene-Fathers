«as»«c7»For each year that passes by, it seems like the average age of the sceners
increases. We all get older and perhaps more established into society.
Therefore it's only natural that we get into relationships... and some of
us have also become «c6»fathers. «c7»And here in D.I.S.C. we want you to taste the
reality of the fathers of the scene... So before you continue reading,
press «l:music/babycry2.tp3»«c5»HERE«le» «c7»to get in a real good mood for this
article, hehe...«»
«»
We're of course sorry for ruining the fun for the fathers of the scene
who just wanted a minute or two to relax away from babynoise and cries,
and just read a digitial magazine.«»
«»
Anyway, let's have a look at a few fathers... and perhaps some mothers as well!«»
«»
«c6»Darkus/IRIS «c7»is quite young, but has already become a father of a son
together with «c6»Monkus/ex.Skid Row.«»
«»
Zytrox/Gods «c7»(ex.scener now) (the coder of JP and old DISC) has also got
married and become a father.«»
«»
«c6»Mr.Spiv/Complex «c7»(the coder of Stone Cruncher and lots more) got married 5
years ago and is the father of two.«»
«»
Even «c6»Lord Helmet/Spaceballs «c7»(the main-ed and creator of RAW) has become a
father of a girl.«»
«c6»Sir Maxin/IRIS «c7»(ex.scener and graphician) got a daughter as well.«»
«»
Then we got «c6»Subbass/Vortex «c7»which definately also is a father.«»
«»
«c6»Moon/Abyss «c7»(ex.scener and coder) and «c6»Mj/Massive «c7»are also reported to expect
children soon.«»
«»
But this is of course not all, a few other babies are reported to be on the
way. And who knows... even «c6»you might become a father before you know it!«»
«»
«c7»It's perhaps not as easy being active scener and being a father at the same
time, but respect to those that manage. And of course we expect that your
children are raised with the goal in mind to become sceners, hehe.«» 
«»
In any case, we wish the «c6»fathers «c7»of the scene good luck! Now return back to
your duties...«»
