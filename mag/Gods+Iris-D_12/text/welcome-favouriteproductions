«as»«c1»I asked some sceners to find out what their favourite productions where,
not regarding the productions being new or old. I also asked them to tell
us why these productions are their favourites. And here are the answers...«»
«»
«c5»"Iltis by Pygmy Projects: «c7»The reason! :) 29kb intro with tons of effects and
I love the music too! Sure many nice intros have been released afterwards!
But Iltis as something special, that hit me on the right spot!"«»

«as»«c7»"Hard to say. I could say that the first demos I saw at my first computer party
were the best, because of the heavy nostalgia. But Id rather not. Id like to
mention the new «c5»Mature Furk demo, «c7»for the awesome feeling it gave me at assembly
this year. It beat all the pc demos too. Now thats the ultimate achievement
:) The demos/intros that have remained favourites for me over a longer period
are: «c5»smokebomb by ozone, deep psilocybin mix by cncd, 2cb by dcs, fetish by
ozone, gift by potion, tint, captured dreams and
rain by tbl and electroboy inside by smoke bomb. «c7»Of course I love all the demos Ive been working on myself, and its
great watching them when Im drunk coming home from town... hehe. Most of the demos
Ive mentioned got their fair share of design and a fair share of code. A nice
balance is the best. Can I have some more hardcore design demos with dark
graphics and ruthless music please? At the end Id like to add that theres no such
thing as my favourite demo. Some are better than others in different respects ,
but none are the best."«»

«as»«c7»"It must be «c5»HARDWIRED!. «c7»It was the first big demo I saw, and the reason why I started seriosly
making graphics. The intrest in demos started on the C64.....I loved to see the intros before
a game, and started collecting intros and demos when they got made."«»

«as»«c5»"Desert Dream «c7»by Kefrens.  Awesome effects (for the time), design and
soundtrack. Even if it's old, sceners of today should learn from this
demo.  This is how to make a demo that really kicks ass! :-)"«»

«as»«c7»"In general it's «c5»diskmags «c7»of all kind, since in a diskmag you've got news
about anything that's happening in the scene."«»

«as»«c5»"Amsterdam Blessings «c7»demo by MAWi. Why? , because music and graphic
project brings me to day-long admiration. I attend this productions for best
AMiGAdemo, which I saw."«»

«as»«c5»"9 fingers «c7»by Spaceballs. Because it's so nice looking and well
done!"«»

«as»«c5»"Arte «c7»by Sanity. It always has been and will forever be my favourite
production. The reason why is simple: it represents everything that a demo
should be and everything the Amiga scene stands for. It achieves the
illogical and the impossible, and leaves the viewer baffled by its creation.
It exhibits new inventions, new techniques and a whole new approach to demo
making. The artwork is self-inspired, detailed and entertaining the music
is melodious, harmonious and intricately structured and the code is as
close to perfect one will ever find. Furthermore, every element in this demo
compliments the other, clicking into position like pieces of a jigsaw.«»
Arte is a demonstration of imagination and skill and above all, Arte proves
that people are smarter than machines. After all, isn't that what the scene
is about?"«»

«as»«c7»"I like every well-designed production, it doesn't depend on the group which
made  it.   Design  and  music is two main aspect making any production more
attracive for me."«»

«as»«c7»"First of all i have to say that good intros impress me more than 
demos because some intros out there feature the same as a good 
demo does but only in less space. this means hard work for every 
member of the team and good teamwork of course. so my favourite 
production is the intro grid. there are really nice effects, nice colors 
and i like the changes between the 2d- and the 3d-scenes. 
additionally there is a little story behind it. it has a start and an 
end, the design is great but not the only thing in it. it is full of 
variety and features great music in really good quality. and all this 
in 40 kb. imho great work!!!"«»

«as»«c7»"My favourite production would have to be Rage demo, with the star wars
effects....as u don't need stupid amounts of hardware to run a nice demo,
and show that good fun can be enjoyed."«»

«ar»«c6»Powerslave/Gods^Void«»

«as»«c5»"Phenomena - Enigma. «c7»Because this was the demo that made the biggest impact on
me, at the time watching it, many other demos/prods have come close too,
especially in the early years, like Hardwired, RSI Megademo, Elysium, etc.,
but Enigma made the biggest spiritual impact."«»

«as»«c7»"Actually that`s «c5»Lapsuus «c7»by Maturefurk, it`s simply PERFECT in all aspects!
And it`s awesome that they have won the combined Amiga & PC democompetition
at Assembly this year and has shown the PC Sceners where the hammer is
hanging!!"«»
