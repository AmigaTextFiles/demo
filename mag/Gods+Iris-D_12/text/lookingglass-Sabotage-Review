«c2»«ac»REVIEW OF SABOTAGE 10 & 11«»

«c1»By Zerox/Gods«»

«»
«as»«c7»Sabotage, the darker form of a scene bulletin, known to be a pack for
swappers only, had it's 10th Anniversary. To celebrate this, the creator
«c6»Lahve of Reason & Scoopex, «c7»decided to spread the packmag also via internet so
the entire scene could watch it.«»
«»
The name «c6»Sabotage «c7»was taken from a video of the band «c6»Beastie Boys, «c7»and the
idea was to create a «c6»dark atmospheric pack «c7»for swappers. For each new
issue, there are new modules, a few articles and messages and sometimes the
intro picture is changed as well. So far 11 issues have been released, and
it's time to have a look at the two last ones. Issue 10 was released at the
very beginning of September 2001, and issue 11 at the beginning of December
2001.«»

The requirements to watch this packmag, are AGA and some fast memory.«»

«c6»SABOTAGE 10 BY REASON«»
«»
«c7»This Sabotage issue got a very nice intro picture done by Pix Of
DarkAge^Nah^Scenic. As we enter the pack, we at once discover the darker
background gfx done by Id Of Vertical Syndicate. It's quite suitable. A
module is being played from Xhale Of DCS^Haujobb. There's also another
module included, it's done by Dipswitch Of DCS. The code was originally
made by Enif/Horizontal Lamerz in C. It's a bit slow, but ok. Who knows if
a new source might appear soon? And the creator and compiler, is as
mentioned above, Lahve - the only real Czech scener left nowadays.«»
«»
The pack itself is concentrating on six sections; «c6»Main «c7»- where you can read
the welcome words, «c6»Swap - «c7»where the swapper charts and swapper forums are
included, «c6»News «c7»- where there's always a big newsfile, «c6»Ads «c7»- where the
adverts obviously are situated, «c6»Articles «c7»- where there are a few articles,
and last, «c6»Messages «c7»- where there are messages, partyinvitations, results
and delaylists.«»
«»
If you have realized how to operate this packmag, it's quite easy to find
what you're interested in. You can press on any of the sections, and all
the contents appear. And in each section, you can press on the article or
message you want to read, or go through all files in that section. There
are also a few special features included, like pressing on «c6»Sabotage, «c7»you'll
see the logo painted in blood.«»
«»
In this issue there is of course an updated new chart in the Swap section.
It's interesting reading as it's the swappers themselves that have voted.
The swappers forum haven't been updated for this issue though, but it will
probably be updated for the next one.«»
The news-section is really «c6»HUGE! «c7»It's probably the biggest newsfile in any
scene production. There are some very hot news included, but also some old
ones.«»
«»
The adverts-section includes adverts from about all active swappers left.
However, it also includes adverts from people that have stopped swapping
ages ago.«»
«»
In the articles department, 5 articles are included this time. They're done
by Gone, Scicco and a weird guy named Zerox.«»
«»
The messages section is really BIG! It got lots of delaylists, messages,
partyresults and invitations. Again, it's probably the biggest such section
in any packmag these days.«»
«»
Nevertheless, if you haven't seen any Sabotage issue so far, then feel free
to «c6»download issue 10 from the Reason homepage. «c7»All other issues can only be
spread by snailmail!«»
«»
«c6»SABOTAGE 11 BY REASON«»
«»
«c7»Sabotage 11 is as all other Sabotage issues, except issue 10, only spread
by snailmail. So if you haven't got it already, then it's hopeless to try
looking for it at the ftp of #amigascne or #aminet for instance. Your only
chance is to ask some of the few swappers left to get the latest issue of
Sabotage.«»
«»
There aren't that many differences between «c6»Sabotage 10 and 11, «c7»as for the
code nor gfx, so I won't repeat what I've written above. But this time
«c6»Angeldust/Apathy & RNO «c7»did the intro picture. It's quite a nice pic. This
time the music, a trance module, was done by «c6»Tripper/Reason^Void^Moods.«»
«»
«c7»As for the contents, there were a bit less in issue 11 compared to issue
10.«»
«»
The «c6»swap-section «c7»didnt't seem to be too updated this time. The swappers
forum seemed to be old, and there weren't that many fresh votes for the
swap-charts either.«»
«»
As always, the «c6»news-section «c7»is incredible BIG. It's most likely the biggest
newsfile in any mag or packmag. However, there were alot of old news here
but also some fresh ones.«»
«»
The «c6»adverts-section «c7»includes adverts from about all active swappers left,
but also some that aren't swapping more.«»
«»
When it comes to the «c6»articles-section, «c7»it was smaller than the last issue.
This time there were included two articles from Gone/Void^Darkage. Those
articles were about everything and nothing really...«»
«»
Also the «c6»message-section «c7»was smaller in issue 11, as there weren't much
messages nor delaylists as usual. But the messages that were included were
fresh, and this section also included some hot party invitations and some
party results.«»
In any case, Sabotage is quite a «c6»good and unique packmag. «c7»It offers a
variety of files concerning most topics that a swapper wants. These days
Sabotage could also be considered to be the best packmag around after my
opinion. But then again, it's always hard to compare all the different
packs and packmags around. What more to say? Yes, «c6»Sabotage issue 12 «c7»will
soon be released... so watch out for it!«»
