«as»«c7»Klimat was actually created a long time ago, but it was not released
before the «c6»Kindergarden party «c7»last year, where it also competed in the
demo competition.«»
«»
In any case, the start of the slideshow is «c6»quite promising. «c7»The music has
an interesting opening, along with a nice Apathy logo being displayed. Then
"presents" appear with a cool star «c6»light effect «c7»behind it. Afterwards, a
small picture with a logo with the name Klimat beneath it, is being
shown.«»
«»
The next thing that happens, is that the «c6»menu «c7»is revealed. It mainly
consists of the 6 pictures you can choose to watch on the left side, and on
the right side, a big head. The menu isn't exactly impressing, but ok. The
music is a bit disturbing after my opinion, and not very fitting.«»
«»
When it comes to the «c6»6 pictures, «c7»which makes this a rather small slideshow,
I can't really give you a good explanation of how they look like. So the
best thing is, as always, to watch the slideshow yourself.«»
Well, I'll add a few words about the various pictures. «c6»The first picture «c7»is
done in greytones and is showing 3 faces. Like about all pictures in this
slide, also this seem to be manipulated with the use of different commands
in the paint program.«»
«»
«c6»The second picture «c7»is of a person in yellow-brown colours. This picture is
also quite expressive, like about all of the pictures in this small
slideshow. «c6»The third picture «c7»is of some more faces. «c6»The fourth, «c7»is a 3
headed flower. Strong and nice colours. «c6»The fifth picture «c7»is being created
by an intereresting painting technique, and shows a person with a bird on
his hand. «c6»The last picture, «c7»is 4 more faces and the credits.«»
«»
All in all, it's just some average pictures really. Nothing astonishing at
all. But some pictures have «c6»some expression, «c7»so perhaps they have some kind
of deeper meaning? I surely don't know.«»
«»
The code got some kind of small bugs on my configuration, but nothing
essential. Apart from that, it also got some «c6»very special features.«»
«»
«c7»Yes, this slideshow actually got «c6»two hidden parts. «c7»The first one you can
find by clicking on the eye of the man displayed in the right side of the
menu. Then infact a «c6»very nice tunnel «c7»appears in the upper right of the menu
page. This is the best part of the slideshow after my opinion. If you press
in the middle of the tunnel, another hidden part will appear. It's just a
«c6»text program «c7»where you can enter your handle, and perhaps Zeeball has
written a message to you? Anyway, this hidden part can also be found by
just clicking in the upper right of the menu. So why don't you check it out
yourself?«»
