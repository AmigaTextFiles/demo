«c7»The last year was a very «c6»positive year «c7»when it comes to the
magscene. The old mag «c6»D.I.S.C. «c7»returned after 6 years of absence in
January. It was a very solid comeback with a real HUGE issue.
And that was just the start of a very good year for the scene.«»
«»
In January also another issue of the cool Polish mag «c6»Taboo «c7»got out. It was
issue 3. And it didn't take long before the best issue ever of the «c6»EuroChart «c7»got
released as well. Issue 42 which got out in February was very big and
continued the great trend of the mags in year 2001. In April also a BIG
issue of «c6»ShowTime «c7»got released. It was issue 16. So you could say that 4 very
big mags had been released the 4 first months of the new year.«»
«»
Only a few months later the long awaited mag «c6»Devotion issue 2 «c7»got released
as well. It was not as big as the other mags, but some sceners enjoyed it
nevertheless. Quantity is not everything. About the same time also the
other major Polish mag, «c6»Excess issue 7, «c7»got released.«»
«»
In July the «c6»EuroChart «c7»issue 43 got out. It was not as big as the previous
issue, but still a good issue. And not very long ago, in September, «c6»Taboo 4
got released. «c7»Once again it was a huge issue.«»
Towards the end of the year, in November, also «c6»Jurassic Pack «c7»made a
comeback. For the first time it wasn't released under the Gods label, and
Sixpack and Zerox didn't write for it. Despite of that, a pretty good issue
was released, hehe...«»
«»
So 2001 brought more releases than the previous years. And now in January
2002, «c6»D.I.S.C. issue 12 «c7»is out for you all to enjoy! But this is not
all, this month or early next month there will probably be released another
issue of the «c6»EuroChart «c7»also. We also expect a few mags from DarkAge to be
released very soon, «c6»ShowTime and Jurassic Pack. «c7»Which will come first,
we never know. In addition to that, «c6»Vortex «c7»is working on the second issue
of their mag to be out soon. Apart from that, S!P has written that they
will try to bring back the old «c6»Scene Lyrics. «c7»Just as some people have been
struggling against the old founders wishes, to bring back the old mag
«c6»Grapevine. «c7»More realistic though are that more issues of «c6»Excess and Taboo
«c7»will be released.«»
«»
The more bad news is that «c6»Devotion «c7»is reported to be dead again, and that
the mag «c6»Coctail «c7»which was announced earlier, is put on ice before the
first issue ever got released. The same has happened to the mag «c6»Offworld «c7»it
seems. I heard some rumours about another issue of «c6»Oepir Risti, «c7»but that's
very uncertain.«»
«»
In any case, 2001 was a «c6»great year for the magscene. «c7»Lets hope year 2002
will be even better...«»
