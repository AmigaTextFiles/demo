«as»
«c7»For the first and last time, I'm actually writing a report of the scene
in Poland. Another scener was supposed to write this scene report, but as
it never reached me I've decided to write it myself. It would be too bad
for a mag claiming to give the best «c6»Digital Information Service for
Computerfreaks «c7»not to include a report from the biggest scene country. With
that in mind, I'm not pretending to give a complete report. Instead I'll try
to focus on the most active and known groups from Poland as my knowledge of
the scene in Poland is very limited.«»

«ac»«c6»AMNESTY:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is a group I hadn't heard anything from for a long time before the
"comeback" at the Symphony party in the middle of September last year. They've been
known for making lots of 4k intros in the past, and some ordinary intros
and demos as well. Their coder Crust has joined Appendix as doublemember.«»

«ac»«c6»APATHY:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- After my knowledge there are 4-5 members of Apathy in Poland, and among them
2-3 coders. So they should have the opportunity to be quite productive.
However, last year I only saw two productions from them. It was
the 4k intro called Scur done by Zeeball for Mekka and the slideshow
Klimat done by Rebel, Zeball and Spektra released at the Kindergarden
party. Anyway, Zeeball has now stopped his scene activities to focus more
on utilities coding. Therefore I guess Apathy won't be very active this
year.«»

«ac»«c6»APPENDIX:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is the oldest active group from Poland these days. It was founded
already back in 1991, but still it's very active. The latest release I've
seen from them was the cute Psychol intro, but they've probably released
something after that. Appendix is behind several packs,
and the famous mag Taboo! In 2000 they smashed their competitors at the
Satellite party with their I Want To Be Machine demo. Last year they've
released the nice designed Melba intro at the Mekka-Symposium and also the
promotion intro for their musicdisk Kiss My Jazz. The musicdisk itself got
released later on. Rumours are indicating that some more demos are on the
way and a certain slideshow from Slayer. This is definately one of the major
groups in Poland. Also note that Juen and Crust joined them, while
Kierownik left.«»

«ac»«c6»DECREE:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is a group which got founded at the end of the 90s I think. Their
first production SemiConductor was released at the Astrosyn'99 party. And
so far the latest production I've seen is the SIL intro from the Symphony
party last year. Their best release so far however, is the demo Planet Goa released
in the year 2000.«»

«ac»«c6»ENCORE:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is a group only consisting of two brothers if I'm not mistaken, but
still they're quite active and are cooperating with several graphicians. I
can't actually remember the names of their older productions though. The
latest demo called Plus (in cooperation with Nah-Kolor) was released at the
Symphony party.«»

«ac»«c6»FLOPI:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- The group Flopi or Floppy as they were used to be called, haven't been that
active lately. Before this was one of the main force behind the Polish
scene. Anyway, the group still got many gifted members and are able to come
up with a production now and then. The latest production I saw from them
however, was the demo Moca at the Mekka-Symposium party.«»

«»
«as»«c7»- This is one of the most active groups of the entire scene. Last
year Mawi released the demos Amsterdam Blessings, Cull Bazaar,
the winner of the Symphony party called Cruel Karma Forms and the winner of
the Delirium party, 212.
In addition to that, Mawi released the video demo Elemental World,
their mag Excess, and their packs Save Da Vinyl and Zosia, pluss Overview.
Towards the end of last year, Mawi released their musicdisk called Mu51k.
It's also reported that the editor Belos has joined the army. Makak from
Moons joined them, while the Czech scener Lahve left them. Read more
about Mawi elsewhere in this mag.«»

«»
«as»«c7»- The last production I saw from Moons, was the intro Yoo! at the Satellite
party. However, the latest news is that the group seems to have been dissolved.
So sadly we'll probably never see anything more from them.«»

«ac»«c6»NAH-KOLOR:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is quite an old group which has hosted many legendary sceners.
However, the latest years they've not been as active on amiga as in the
past. But last year they did manage to release the demo Magic at the
Mekka-Symposium party and the demo Plus together with Encore at the
Symphony party. Nevertheless, their popularity has decreased in Poland
lately and they've become much more active on PC. In any case, they
continue releasing their famous pack Speed.
Some news is that their polish hq Juen joined Appendix too. The
musician Voicer rejoined and also the graphician Mantra joined them.«»

«ac»«c6»POTION:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- Potion is a group which got formed only 3-4 years ago and has delivered
several high-quality productions during these years
which certainly has impressed the scene. I can't say I've seen something
from them the last half year or so, but at the Mekka-Symposium party last
year they presented the smashing Option intro which won the competition,
just as Gift did the previous year. Anyway, Potion got to be one of the
most successful groups around at the moment as they're mostly winning every
party they attend.«»

«»
«as»«c7»- This is a group which I haven't heard too much from lately. But they're
reported to be working on another issue of their Embrion pack and a few
other productions, and have certainly some very talented members among
them. The latest production I saw from them however was the Murderer demo
at the Satellite party.«»

«»
«as»«c7»- This group is releasing the Frozenpack, which is about the only more or
less regular packmag these days in the sense it's actually released when
the intros are fresh. Several issues of that pack got released
last year, and I'm sure more will come this year. But I can't say I've seen any
intros/demos from this group at all since the Satellite party.«»

«as»«c7»There are perhaps a few other groups I should have mentioned as well, like
Attic, Deputy, Energy, Harvester, GBA, "World Federation Of Mad Snickers" and
others, but I simply do not know much about them. However, I can mention
that GFA released a new packmag called Soul in December, and the third
issue of their mag Gorzka Dusza in November. And the group Breath seems to
have been dissolved. But that's about all I know. Hopefully most of the
information I've presented above are accurate though.«»
