«as»
«c7»The Norwegian scene hasn't got as many members as in the past. Many good
crews have more or less faded away, like «c6»Andromeda, Stone Arts and Talent «c7»(amiga)
the latest years. But nevertheless, there are still some very good crews here
and at least a couple of teams which can compete with the best international
teams. I don't have a complete oversight nor do I pretend to have one, so please
do send me the latest information concerning your group and I'll update this
report for the next issue of D.I.S.C.«»

«c6»APATHY:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- The group has produced lots of productions during the latest years, from
intros and demos, to musicdisks and packs. At the Gathering party last year
Apathy managed to come 2nd in the intro competition with their AHA-Remix.
They also released the demo Wormhole at The Mekka-Symposium party.
Now it seems like they are working on a production for The Gathering.
The last release from Apathy was the slideshow Klimat done by the Polish
members. You can read the review elsewhere in D.I.S.C.«»

«ac»«c6»CONTRAZ:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- Contraz has been one of the best norwegian teams the latest years with many
releases; both intros and demos. I first noticed them at the Gathering'95,
and afterwards they've improved quite much. The group is a result of two crews
joining forces; NSS and Black Spiders, and some of the members have been sceners
for a real long time. The latest releases I've seen were from the Mekka-Symposium
party last year and the Kindergarden Invitro released in October. At the moment
it seems like the only real active member of this group is the coder Dran, which
has been behind all the releases the latest years on Amiga. But the Java
invitro for the Kindergarden party was done by both Enex and Dran. Contraz is
now also the organizers of the Kindergarden party.«»

«ac»«c6»DARKAGE:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- They have only one famous member in Norway these days as the co-organizer
Punisher left them last year. The member left is the graphician Bridgeclaw
which seems to have joined & become a double member in 1999.
Bridgeclaw has contributed in a few productions also, like ShowTime, Neo2.
and Jurassic Pack.«»

«ac»«c6»DEPTH:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- Tbey have been in Norway since around 1994 I think. The last release
I saw from them, was the dentro Arcane Lugter released at the Kindergarden
party. It was done in cooperation with the Danish members. Recently the old
member Rolex got kicked out, while the coder Skurk joined.«»

«al»«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Allanon, Sprocket and Slumgud.«»
«»
«ac»«c6»DONUT FETISH:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- They had a small active period around 96/97 I think.  Some of the members
are still around, but I guess most of them are also double-members in other
groups, like Contraz.«»

«ac»«c6»DUAL CREW - SHINING:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is a very old team as well, but not in Norway. I'm not sure what the
norwegian members of this group have made. Except that their graphician Optic
is supporting lots of mags, like DISC, Devotion and The EuroChart online!«»
«»
«al»«c5»Well-Known Member: «c2»Optic and Xhale«»
«»
«ac»«c6»EPHIDRENA:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is the leading norwegian team these days after the departure of Andromeda,
perhaps in some competition with groups like Spaceballs and Contraz. They are
also one of the leading international groups these days. Ephidrena got
founded in mid 1995, and have been very
active the latest years with lots of demos and intros. Their big breakthrough
got to be with the winning Concrete demo at the Party 9, but of course they've
also made some great intros that have done good at various parties. The
last release I saw from them was Sfumato released at the Kindergarden party
in November last year. The next releases expected from Ephidrena will be out
at the Mekka-Symposium party.«»

«ac»«c6»GODS:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This group got founded in 1994 and was very active the next 3 years. The latest
years they have not been very active on amiga. They norwegian side of this crew
was probably at its best around 1995. They're behind a certain diskmag called
D.I.S.C. and some slideshows. The demos and intros were mainly done by the French
coders in cooperation with the norwegian graphicians. Recently alot of new
talented members have joined them, also in Norway. Who knows what that
might lead to?«»

«»
«ac»«c6»HAUJOBB:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- The norwegian side of Haujobb is perhaps not the most productive one, but
that's perhaps not their fault. Two of the members are editors and are
awaiting the source for their mag Friendchip. They are also the host of the
the site Slengpung. In addition that, all of the members are seen at most
of the parties.«»
«»
«al»«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Arcane, Sixpack and Xhale.«»
«»
«ac»«c6»IRIS:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This crew was very active in Norway from around 1990 until 1994, when some of
the norwegian members founded Gods. They released productions such as HitPack,
A Pack Of Fun, D.I.S.C. in addition to some intros. After 1994 there haven't
been many norwegian members of this old group. The most known the latest years
have been MJ, but he got kicked out because of inactivity last year.
Now there is only one norwegian member left.«»

«ac»«ac»«c6»MASSIVE:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- Massive is one of the older crews these days in Norway. But I'm afraid
I can't remember seeing any of their productions. These days they are
rather inactive.«»

«ac»«c6»NAH-KOLOR:«»

«as»«c7»- This Polish group also have got members in Norway. Rumours are also
saying that Strife has joined them as doublemember, but that might not be
true.«»

«»
«ac»«c6»RAVE NETWORK OVERSCAN:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- I'm not sure what's happening with the norwegian members of R.N.O. at the
moment. They seem to be very silent, except from the RNO Records releases.«»
«»
«al»«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Romeo, Tft and Zubspace.«»
«»
«ac»«c6»SCENIC:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is a new group founded by Fusko and Pix last year. It's
quite special as it only consists of graphicians. The group will mainly
cooperate with other groups and make the entire design in productions for them.
At the moment Scenic is also working on slideshows, both on Amiga and PC.«»
«»
«al»«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Fusko, Orome and Pix.«»
«»
«ac»«c6»SPACEBALLS:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is a legendary crew which got founded back in 1989. It has had lots of
famous members, like Dark Helmet, Lone Starr, Lord Helmet, Vinnie and Major Asshole
to mention a few. It has also released lots of quality demos during this period,
most famous are probably Wayfarer, State Of The Art, RAW and 9 Fingers. The latest
years they have been even more active with Slummy as the coding-force behind all
productions. They've won the demo compo at the Gathering Party amazingly 4
times! The last production from them so far, is the oldskool demo called
Hideous Mutant Freaks from the Trsac 3 party and Fogroom from the KG party,
in addition to the D.I.S.C. #12 intro!«»

«»
«ac»«c6»SPECTER:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is a group consisting only of norwegian members. However, most
members are double or triple-members and some are using different handles in this
group. Nevertheless, Lost Puppy 4 and Bubble are among the releases under the Specter label.«»
«»
«al»«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Chauple, Leia, Rolex and Pix.«»
«ac»«c6»SQUIRRELZ:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is a very special team. In addition to being something so rare as a new
group in the norwegian scene, it also contains only females. However, the
only productions I've seen from them so far, were Rabb-It and Spinner. But
those were obviously not done by them, hehe...  At the Trsac 3 party in the
middle of October they released the wilddemo The Obstacle Test. Good luck with
future productions though.«»
«»
«al»«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Alv, Leia and Peaky.«»
«»
«ac»«c6»TRIUMPH:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- This is also a very old group. I think I got a musicdisk of them from 1989/90,
and the group might as well be a bit older than that.
They have released several demos and intros. I'm not sure if its
the original members that are releasing the productions nowadays, but Triumph
is still more or less alive. Probably less.«»

«»
«ac»«c6»VOID:«»
«»
«as»«c7»- According to my knowledge the only norwegian member of this group, is now
Runrummer. And it seems like he is back in business again now. In any case,
they're working on a new pack called Saxonia. At the Mekka-Symposium party
they're expected to release a final version of a demo called DølleDuck.«»
«»
«al»«c5»Well-Known Member: «c2»Runrummer.«»
«»
«as»«c7»There are also a few norwegian fun-groups around, but I don't know much
about them I'm afraid.«»
