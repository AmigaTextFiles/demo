«c7»Editors was a new creation in the last issue of D.I.S.C. Previously we had
included all kind of scene-releated articles, including the articles about
editors, reply articles etc. in the Scene section. However, this new
section is ment to be a «c6»playground for editors. «c7»We have not included too
many of such articles in this issue of D.I.S.C. as we wanted to focus more
on the demo scene. However, in the future we are sure there will be plenty 
of articles of editors writing about editors, editors views, reply-articles,
about new projects, mags etc.«»
