»CL1:These »CL0:thoughts »CL1:are in  response to some words the  pc scener »CL0:Alive wrote »CL1:on irc.
»CL2:Alive  »CL1:is, presumably,  a »CL0:graphician»CL1:. He was  insisting the  usual... How  Amiga
sceners are deleterious to the entire scene. Like how the scene can only »CL0:advance
»CL1:with the »CL0:latest technology»CL1:. Like  how more colors and polygons somehow makes the
work more profound. But then he wrote  something disappointing;  That »CL0:coders »CL1:are
also  »CL0:obsolete  »CL1:in the  scene. That  progress in  software will  soon  allow the
graphician  to  achieve  all  the  effects  of  the  coder,  without  having  to
collaborate with what  he considered a less-creative individual.  Hmm. Well as a
graphician myself I would like to say a few words of »CL0:respect »CL1:for the »CL0:coder»CL1:..

»CL1:Now the demo, as we in the scene know, is the most complete art on computer. The
»CL0:computer  »CL1:is  more than just  »CL0:another  tool »CL1:for the  artist.  Like a new kind of
brush. Using  it as only that is to miss so much of »CL1:its  potential. At its core,
it is an art based in numbers. Fractals  showed us that there is beauty in math. And
»CL0:MC Escher  »CL1:showed us  that  mathematicians  can »CL0:have  creative  souls»CL1:.  But  the




















computer showed us that  while there is an art to  »CL0:numbers »CL1:on  paper, it »CL0:becomes
poetry »CL1:through the cathode ray.  As such, the coder is the foundation of all art
on the computer and no other »CL0:modern artist »CL1:thinks as »CL0:abstractly »CL1:as they..

»CL1:This is a great achievement. Graphicians like »CL2:Alive»CL1: resent their reliance on the
coder in the scene.  However, in  their own art they are often  only »CL0:translating
pictures  »CL1:from  paper  onto the screen.  This  is a  much »CL0:less  impressive »CL1:task.
Fundamentally, there is art on the computer that is created without a coder. But
it is not a demo. All other arts are »CL0:evolutions »CL1:of existing schools. Painting in
Brilliance.  Sculpture in Lightwave. But  only a demo manipulates digital art on
all levels from the pixels down to the code..

»CL1:That being said,  I do not understand  people like »CL2:Alive.»CL1:  It is not  enough for
them to have  different convictions and  live by them.  Instead, where  they see
others with  different  tenets living  happily, they come to  preach and accuse.
Maybe it is because of »CL0:frustration»CL1:. Their feeling »CL1:everytime they see better work
being created on  what they  consider »CL0:futile hardware»CL1:. Or maybe it is because of
guilt. As though not accepting  their own boringness is keeping them from moving
on. Either way, I would think  »CL2:Alive»CL1: should know its a  better dogma to »CL0:live and
let live»CL1:..
