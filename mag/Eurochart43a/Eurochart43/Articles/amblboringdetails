Additional  last  minute support by Michal Lipiecki »CL2:(Borys)»CL1: and Andrzej Nowinski
»CL2:(Def)»CL1:.   Due  to  the »CL0: 8  MB »CL1: party size limitations we decided not to include a
complex  »CL0:3-d  scene»CL1: made by Def.  Maybe we`ll use it for another production.  As
the  main  producer  I  want  to  greet everybody who helped us making this demo
possible  (you  know  who  you are) and the whole polish scene bustrip team from
»CL0:mekka-symposium 2001»CL1:.  Expect us next year in»CL0: fallingbostel»CL1:, too!

Also  respects  to  »CL2:The  Black  Lotus»CL1: team, especially to »CL2:Louie500 »CL1:and »CL2:Kalmski»CL1: -
you`re  great  but work more on your »CL0:hangovers»CL1: =) No respects to the »CL0:PURE LAMERS»CL1:
from »CL2:Loonies»CL1: (especially »CL2:booster»CL1:) who showed us repeatedly how to »CL0:fuck lambs»CL1: and
really »CL0: fake  votes»CL1:  in  the  demo scene.  »CL0:Shame»CL1: on you, kids!  Better try to be
»CL0:creative  »CL1:and »CL0:think»CL1:, instead of showing people »CL0:A500»CL1: effects running in one frame
on »CL0:060»CL1:.  You`re »CL0:sad»CL1: and I »CL2:(Azzaro)»CL1: »CL0:piss»CL1: on you.
