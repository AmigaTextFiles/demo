»CL6:Amsterdam  Blessings»CL1:  it  says here.  What are these »CL0:blessings»CL1:?  And who is this
»CL0:Amsterdam»CL1:?  Well I suppose I will find out now..

»CL0:Two  months»CL1: later I plug in »CL0:32»CL1: new megs and am ready to go.  Little »CL0:#»CL1: chars tick
along the screen as the demo loads.  From the »CL0:readme»CL1: it looks as though the demo
is broken into 3 parts:  »CL0:Hell»CL1:, »CL0:Earth»CL1: and »CL0:Heaven»CL1:.  This is serious stuff.

The  »CL0:music»CL1:  starts.   A  little  girl  is  reading  a »CL0:nursery rhyme»CL1: as the title
displays:   »CL3:'Halfway  between regrets and the [sic] solitude'»CL1:.  This is cut with
other  words,  like uhmm, »CL0:synonyms»CL1:.  For »CL0:mood»CL1:.  When the girl says, »CL3:'Scary'»CL1:, the
screen flashes:  »CL3:'Afraid'»CL1:.  With the word, »CL3:'Solitude'»CL1:, it flashes:  »CL3:'All Alone'»CL1:.
Hmm.  This is a little »CL0:silly»CL1:.

Rather  abruptly  the music»CL0: stops»CL1:.  »CL3:'Earth ring'»CL1: it says.  This apparently looks
like  clusters  of  large  »CL0:flat  shaded  objects»CL1:  rotating over the screen.  The




















objects  are  a  very  »CL0:translucent»CL1:  black  with bright »CL0:white points»CL1:.  This looks
»CL0:great»CL1:.   It is »CL0:layered»CL1: over a nicely designed »CL0:picture»CL1:.  You know this because it
has  the  word,  »CL3:'Picture'»CL1:, written on it.  The letters are »CL0:burnt»CL1: behind the »CL0:3D»CL1:,
and  as  the  object  moves  it gives the »CL0:illusion»CL1: of a »CL0:calculated»CL1: effect.  This
style of »CL0:clever design»CL1: appears throughout the demo.

Now  we  see  the  »CL0:credits»CL1:.  Very interesting here in that there are »CL0:no»CL1: handles;
only  »CL0:real  names»CL1:.   Could  this be for »CL0:design»CL1:?  Like when a »CL0:website»CL1: gives their
address as:  »CL3:whatisthemawi dot net»CL1:?  Later, after seeing all the »CL0:effort»CL1: put into
the  demo,  I  wonder  if  maybe »CL2:MAWI»CL1: is hoping to use »CL6:AMBL»CL0: for their »CL0:commercial»CL1:
portfolio.  The design is that good.

Wow.   Very  nice »CL0:metaballs»CL1:.  These are layered over »CL0:circle»CL1: vector shapes.  This
integration  is  handled  to  great  effect, and the »CL0:multilayering»CL1: of visuals is
»CL0:consistent»CL1:  throughout  the  demo.  It is this consistency that has been missing
from  all  their  »CL0:previous »CL1: productions.   Also I notice the »CL0:sound»CL1: for the first
time.  It picks up with that great »CL0:beat»CL1: that made »CL6:Mute12»CL1: enjoyable.  This is one
of the best parts of the demo.

After  this we see some of the »CL0:hi-res art»CL1: that is characteristic of their recent




















productions.   These are »CL0:collages»CL1: with strong »CL0:typography»CL1: and »CL0:design»CL1:.  The images
are  almost certainly »CL0:scanned»CL1: and »CL0:manipulated»CL1: with »CL0:PS»CL1: filters.  However, they do
pull it off nicely.

Now  another  great  effect.  It is a grid of »CL0:square»CL1: vector shapes that scale to
form  »CL0:characters»CL1:.  But what is it saying?  »CL0:M - A - W - I - A - T - M - S - 2 - 0
-  0 - 1 -»CL1: errr.  Okay.  Maybe they're not »CL0:always»CL1: original.  In fact the vectors
are  layered  over  a »CL0:cloud»CL1: effect that reminds me much of the end of »CL6:Senseless»CL1:.
Later,  the  greets  remind  me  of  »CL6:Captured Dreams»CL1:.  The »CL2:Wizards»CL1: are obviously
influenced very much by »CL2:TBL»CL1:.  And they do know good »CL0:design»CL1: - their greets in the
»CL0:readme»CL1: are like a who's who of the best »CL0:designers»CL1: and»CL0: groups»CL1: in the scene.

Here we have an »CL0:env mapped»CL1: object and another »CL0:clever»CL1: effect.  »CL0:Picture-in-Picture»CL1:
is  not  new  in  the  scene.  But here the small picture displays the view of a
»CL0:camera»CL1:  -  depicted by a »CL0:cross-hair vector»CL1: - flying through the object.  This is
great.   And  even  with  two changing displays on the screen, nothing stays the
same  long  in  »CL6:Amsterdam Blessings»CL1:.  The small picture fades out and the camera
disappears.   Later it comes back.  In fact it is their »CL0:timing»CL1: and »CL0:staggering»CL1: of
effects  that gives the demo »CL0:life»CL1: on extended play.  A great example is the next
screen.  At first we see a nicely designed »CL0:image»CL1::  What looks like a »CL0:puddle»CL1: over




















a  Brooklyn  »CL0:sewer»CL1:,  again  the  word,»CL3: Picture»CL1:, in case you forgot.  While their
obvious  respect to »CL2:superK's»CL1: home state is moving, it is nothing when the puddle
starts  to »CL0:ripple»CL1:.  Next a vector shaped like a »CL0:cheshire cat»CL1: fades in and out in
time  to a »CL0:mewing»CL1: sample.  Finally spinning »CL0:objects»CL1: fade in.  These look so nice
they could possibly be »CL0:prerendered frames»CL1:.  All very nice composition.

The  next  effect  is like looking up through a city of dark gray »CL0:monoliths»CL1: to a
sky  of  white »CL0:parchment»CL1:.  It is a nice »CL0:contrast»CL1:, the »CL0:dark»CL1: and »CL0:light»CL1:, over which
appear  slickly  shot  »CL0:photos»CL1: and more meaningless »CL0:mood writing»CL1:.  The photos are
really  nice.   Like  »CL0:Avedon»CL1:  nice.   Which is why I'm not surprised to see them
credit  a  »CL0:stock  photo  CD»CL1:  in  the readme.  This is not meant to »CL0:denigrate»CL1: the
obvious  »CL0:effort»CL1:  they spent with each image however.  Manipulating it until they
had  the desired »CL0:look»CL1: and »CL0:feel»CL1:.  This control over every aspect of »CL6:AMBL»CL1: leads to
a »CL0:consistency»CL1: greater than in any of their previous productions.

Sadly,  at  about  this  point  my  version  »CL0:crashes»CL1:.   Thus  ends a very pretty
production  by  one  of  the  best  groups  »CL0:active»CL1: in the »CL0:Amiga scene»CL1:.  I became
interested  in  the  »CL2:Wizards»CL1:  after  »CL6:Mute12»CL1:.   Although the demo was »CL0:crippled»CL1: by
terrible  »CL0:consistency»CL1:  and  »CL0:flow»CL1:,  there  were  brilliant  moments and a »CL0:kicking»CL1:
soundtrack.   None of their work before compared to it, and I had high hopes for




















their next production.  With »CL6:Amsterdam Blessings»CL1:, »CL2:MAWI»CL1: did »CL0:not»CL1: disappoint.  If I
were  to  compare  them  to the group that influenced them most, then »CL6:Mute12»CL1: was
their»CL6: Captured Dreams»CL1: - the »CL0:breakthrough»CL1: demo where they matured from»CL0: sceners»CL1: to
»CL0:designers»CL1: - and this then is their »CL6:Rain»CL1:.  It may not have the great sound of »CL6:12»CL1:,
but  it  is  their  best  effort so far and will keep me interested in all their
»CL0:future »CL1: work.  In the end it is only more satisfying to read how good a time the
group had »CL0:making»CL1: it.  Good work mates.  Box on...
