»CL1:You know what?

It  makes  me  sick to my stomach that
practically  »CL0:every»CL1:  time  I  see a new
demo   I'm   confronted  with  blatant
disregard   for   the   most   crucial
principles in »CL0:visual design»CL1:.  Each new
demo  is  just  an  »CL0:endless»CL1:  parade of
embarrasing lack of »CL0:talent»CL1:.

Now,  I would »CL0:never»CL1: say that all demos
are  poorly designed as such.  In fact
some  are really very »CL0:stylish»CL1: and show
great »CL0:  skill »CL1:  on   behalf   of   the
designer(s).   But  as  you know, most





demos   include   rather   lengthy  »CL0:3D
scenes»CL1:.   It's  the  design  of  these
scenes  that  really»CL0: annoys»CL1: me; how »CL0:2D
effects »CL1: should  be pieced together in
order  to  look good is more or less a
matter of »CL0:taste»CL1:, and of course overall
demo design »CL0:HAS»CL1: come a long way in the
last  »CL0:ten »CL1: years.   But  the one thing
that  continually  appears the work of
true »CL0:amateurs»CL1: are »CL0:3D scenes»CL1:.

First  of all, think »CL0:television»CL1:.  I've
often heard that a demo is much like a
»CL0:short  film»CL1: or a »CL0:music video»CL1:.  This is
a   nice  basis  for  comparison,  and
especially  true  of  »CL0:3D  demos»CL1:.   The
trouble  is by the standards thus set,
Amiga demos really »CL0:suck!»CL1:

Granted,  realistic  animation is hard
to accomplish.  Especially when you're
animating  things  that everyone of us
experiences  daily in which case we're
always  very  quick to notice even the
tiniest of deviations from »CL0:realism»CL1:.  A
person's  »CL0:walk»CL1:  is  among  the hardest
things to reproduce.  »CL6:Rise»CL1: and »CL6:Alien 2»CL1:
show two very good »CL0:examples»CL1: of how »CL0:NOT»CL1:
to   do  it.   The  first  thing  that
strikes me when I watch, say, »CL6:Alien 2»CL1:,
is  that  I  can't help but notice the
way  the characters »CL0:walk»CL1:.  It's so far
from being natural that it draws a lot
of  »CL0:attention»CL1:  away from what might be
»CL0:good»CL1: in the demo.
Now  what  has  this  got  to  do with
»CL0:design»CL1:,  you  ask?  Ok, let's focus on
»CL6:Alien 2»CL1: and review the problems:

»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:               MOTION
»CL1:--------------------------------------

The  characters  appear  to be »CL0:sliding»CL1:
across  the floor.  (»CL2:Scoopex »CL1:should be
more  careful when they wax the floors
of    their   spaceships.    I   mean,
accidents   are   bound   to   happen,
especially   when   the  auto-destruct
sequence  can  be  activated  by  just
touching  a few protruding cylinders.)
There   doesn't   appear  to  be  much
»CL0:friction»CL1:  there,  and  this is a thing
you  must  be really careful with when
animating  »CL0:real-life»CL1:-like objects.  If
you   can't   do   it   right,   which
apparently  »CL2:Scoopex»CL1: couldn't, then try
not  to  »CL0:show»CL1:  it.  This is one of the
most  important  things in any kind of
design; »CL0:hiding»CL1: your »CL0:mistakes»CL1:.

Making a demo is a lot like putting on
a  »CL0:magic»CL1:  show.   It's only impressive
when you draw attention »CL0:away»CL1: from what
the  »CL0:audience »CL1: would think less of you
if they saw.

»CL0:Shadows»CL1:,  »CL0:dimly lit areas»CL1:, portions of
the   view   »CL0:obscured »CL1: by  »CL0:objects»CL1:  or
(semi-transparent)  »CL0:clipart»CL1:  on top of
everything  -  there  are many ways to
»CL0:hide»CL1:  the  things  that don't look too
good  and so much to »CL0:gain»CL1: by doing so.
An  easy trick is simply choosing your
»CL0:viewpoint»CL1: with care.  When»CL0: actors»CL1: seem
to  punch  each  other  in »CL0: films»CL1:, for
example, they really only hit »CL0:thin air»CL1:
close   to  the  opposing  actor,  but
because of where the »CL0:camera»CL1: is placed,
you don't notice this and thus you get
the  »CL0:illusion»CL1:  of an actual fistfight.
But back to »CL6:Alien 2»CL1:..

The  characters are »CL0:stiff»CL1: and not very
»CL0:lifelike»CL1:.   Again, there's not much to
do about that because the 3D »CL0:engine»CL1: is
only   so   good,  and  because  »CL0:human»CL1:
movements (or those of any animal) are
extremely  »CL0:complex»CL1:.  Even »CL0:professional»CL1:
3D  animators rely on real-life »CL0:models»CL1:
to  perform  human  movements.   As  a
simple »CL0:scener»CL1: with only limited means,
you  need  to find another way to make
the  scene  look  good.   One solution
would  be  not  to show the »CL0:legs»CL1:.  The
character   could   move  behind  some
crates,  only  revealing his legs once
in  a  while  and  not long enough for
anyone  to  notice the silly walk.  Or
the  shot might simply be of his »CL0:upper
body»CL1:.   Or  he might be wearing a long
dress.  Or whatever.

»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:                SPEED
»CL1:--------------------------------------

One  other  thing  about the character
movements  -  they're very, very »CL0:slow»CL1:.
It  makes  me  think the animators are
complete    »CL0:shut-ins»CL1:    who've   never
actually  seen  a  »CL0:real»CL1:  person  move.
»CL0:No one»CL1:  moves that slow.  Of course it
might be meant as »CL0:slow-motion»CL1:, but why
a  slow-motion  shot  of  a  guy who's
merely  »CL0:walking»CL1:  down a corridor?  All
in  all  3D  demos  are  far,  far too
»CL0:slow-paced»CL1: on the Amiga.  There's just
not enough »CL0:action»CL1:, so you get »CL0:bored.»CL1:

»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:              PERSPECTIVE
»CL1:--------------------------------------

Probably  the  most  »CL0:horrible»CL1:  part of
»CL6:Alien  2»CL1:  is  the  use of »CL0:perspective»CL1:.
There's  NO  »CL0:camera  play»CL1:.  One of the
first   things   they  teach  aspiring
»CL0:directors»CL1:    is    how    to   exploit
perspective.    There   are   so  many
»CL0:tricks»CL1:,   »CL0:rules»CL1:  and»CL0:  guidelines»CL1:,  and
knowing  at least a portion of them is
»CL0:vital»CL1: to doing good 3D design.

Perspective  is often employed to give
an  otherwise  normal  scene a certain
»CL0:atmosphere»CL1:.   Imagine a guy walking up
to  the  door  of his house, inserting
the  key, turning it, opening the door
and   then  disappearing  through  the
doorway.   We  see  this sort of thing
every  day, so it's not interesting »CL0:in
itself»CL1:.   But  if we add »CL0:atmosphere»CL1: to
the    scene   it   suddenly   becomes
»CL0:interesting»CL1:.   A scene this simple can
»CL0:signal»CL1: a lot of things;

»CL0:Emotion: »CL1:   Our   hero   is   seen  in
»CL0:close-ups»CL1:   mainly.    The  shots  are
»CL0:brief»CL1:,     sometimes    »CL0:erratic »CL1:   and
concentrate   on   the   »CL0:person»CL1:.   You
shouldn't   draw   attention   to  his
inserting  the key unless perhaps this
relates to the character's »CL0:feelings.»CL1:

»CL0:Modernism:»CL1:       Strange,     »CL0:uncommon»CL1:
viewpoints  make the »CL0:viewer»CL1: think that
he's  "not really sure what's going on
here".   Occasional »CL0:slow motion»CL1: as the
character's »CL0: foot»CL1:  touches the »CL0:ground»CL1:,
closeups   of   the   »CL0:keyhole»CL1:...    be
»CL0:imaginative»CL1:.    Or  the  entire  scene
might  be seen from »CL0:low vantage point»CL1:,
say,  the  lower  left  corner  of the
»CL0:doorway»CL1: which is certainly »CL0:surreal»CL1:.

»CL0:Space/loneliness:»CL1:    The   camera   is
placed  »CL0:far»CL1:  from the object in focus.
Not  much  »CL0:movement»CL1: because that gives
the  camera  too much »CL0:life»CL1: which draws
attention  to the »CL0:object»CL1: and away from
the   »CL0:surroundings»CL1:.   Everything  must
suggest  that this fellow sees himself
as »CL0: small»CL1:  and »CL0:insignificant»CL1: in a »CL0:huge»CL1:
world that probably doesn't care about
him.

»CL0:Claustrophobia:»CL1:   Let  the  camera  go
»CL0:into»CL1: the doorway with him.  Stay »CL0:close»CL1:
so  as  not  to  show »CL0:space»CL1: around the
character.   In  a  sense  this  space
doesn't   »CL0:exist»CL1:   before   the  camera
»CL0:reveals»CL1:  it  and  thus  is  produced a
sensation   of   uncomfortably   tight
space.

»CL0:Exaggerated     calm     and    order:»CL1:
Everything   is  seen  in  »CL0:straight-on»CL1:
views.   The  »CL0:edges»CL1: of the doorway are
»CL0:parallel»CL1:  to  the edges of the »CL0:screen»CL1:,
the  camera  is  always »CL0:level»CL1: with the
»CL0:horizon»CL1:,  the  »CL0:front»CL1:  of  the house is
»CL0:parallel»CL1: to the »CL0:projection plane»CL1:, etc.


»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:        AND MORE PERSPECTIVE
»CL1:--------------------------------------

Atmosphere    isn't   everything,   of
course.   If the demo has a »CL0:plot»CL1:, that
plot  can be »CL0:emphasized»CL1: through »CL0:camera
play»CL1:.   It's  not  simply  a matter of
what goes on in the 3D scene, but just
as  much  a question of how that scene
is »CL0:translated»CL1: onto the screen.

»CL0:Close-ups»CL1:  draw  heavy attention to an
object  or  character,  a  thing which
»CL0:sticks»CL1:  with  the  »CL0:viewer»CL1:  for a while
making  it  the  »CL0:centre»CL1:  of whatever's
going   on   even   if   the  object's
momentarily »CL0:off-screen»CL1:.

Panorama  shots give a clear view of a
scene.   This  is  useful  »CL0:before»CL1: some
action is to take place.  It keeps the
viewer from getting too»CL0: confused»CL1:.  But
perspective  can also »CL0:induce»CL1: confusion
of  course,  causing the scene to seem
»CL0:hectic»CL1:   and   »CL0:chaotic»CL1:,  by  producing
»CL0:short»CL1:,  »CL0:erratic»CL1:  shots,  perhaps  with
»CL0:quick   movements»CL1:.   All  in  all,  3D
scenes  in  demos  have  far  too »CL0:long»CL1:
camera  shots.   One thing that really
bores  me  is the symmetric »CL0:stonehengy»CL1:
construction  with  the  four  (always
four)  arching »CL0:spikes»CL1: pointing towards
a space slightly above the whole thing
which   then  houses  some  »CL0:object»CL1:  or
collection  of »CL0:lensflares»CL1:.  I'm not so
much  sick  of  that  as  I am sick of
going  around  it  and  around  it and
around  it  again  and again and again
while   nothing  really  »CL0:happens»CL1:.   It
takes  too  long,  and  I  often  find
myself  »CL0:killing»CL1: a demo after the first
30 seconds of that.

Anyway,   always   remember  that  the
viewer  »CL0: identifies»CL1:  with  the »CL0: camera»CL1:
because  the camera is the only »CL0:window»CL1:
to the virtual »CL0:world»CL1: that the 3D scene
represents.   If  there are characters
in  the scene, you may want the camera
to  »CL0:relate»CL1:  to  those characters, thus
making  the  viewer  »CL0:identify»CL1: with the
characters.   If  a  group  of them is
running,  say,  the  camera  might run
»CL0:with»CL1:  them,  giving the viewer a sense
of being »CL0:part»CL1: of that group.

If  you  can't  do good camera play on
your  own, then watch a good »CL0:movie»CL1: and
copy something from there, at least.
»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:               LIGHTING
»CL1:--------------------------------------

Another  problem  with  »CL6:Alien 2»CL1: is the
poor »CL0:colour scheme»CL1:.  It doesn't really
reflect  any »CL0: atmosphere»CL1:.  But this is
more  in  the  »CL0:2D »CL1: design  department,
perhaps.    Anyone   who   understands
»CL0:graphics»CL1:  understands the effects that
various   »CL0:  colours  »CL1:   and     colour
»CL0:combinations»CL1:   have  on  the  observer
(although     this     becomes    more
complicated when combined with motion,
and especially with 3D motion).

And there are no»CL0: shadows»CL1:.  Shadows are
SO  important.   They don't have to be
»CL0:real»CL1:,  and  all  the  characters don't
need  to cast shadows on all the »CL0:walls»CL1:



    »PIC:dafreak-ec3.iff»
















and »CL0:floors»CL1:, but you could do some »CL0:fake»CL1:
lighting on the surroundings anyway to
underline  the  fact  that  an  object
somehow  »CL0:relates»CL1:  to  his surroundings
and   isn't   just  drawn  on  »CL0:top»CL1:  of
everything for no good reason.

Even if the only use of lighting is to
»CL0:shade»CL1:  the  objects,  be careful where
you  place  light  sources  because it
»CL0:does»CL1:  matter.   Lightsources differ in
»CL0:type»CL1:   as  well;  »CL0:spotlights»CL1:,  »CL0:ambient
light»CL1:,  »CL0: sunlight»CL1:,   etc.    But  this
lighting can only really be controlled
with such »CL0:freedom»CL1: in the most »CL0:advanced»CL1:
3D  engines.  For those of you without
such  »CL0:code»CL1:  at  your  disposal, try to
work »CL0:around»CL1: the problems instead.


»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:              THE PLOT
»CL1:--------------------------------------

I  won't get into the plot of »CL6:Alien 2»CL1:.
It's  obviously  not there.  Nor is it
there    in    »CL6:Rise»CL1:    or »CL6:  Relic »CL1:  or
»CL6:Cybercinematastic »CL1: nor in any other »CL0:3D
demo»CL1:.   This  is  not »CL0:critical»CL1:, but it
would  be  nice to see a 3D demo where
one   would  actually  be  enticed  to
»CL0:follow»CL1: the action.

It  also provides an »CL0:"entry point"»CL1: for
designing the scenes so one may better
make  all the necessary »CL0:considerations»CL1:
for good camera play, lighting, etc.



»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:            IN CONCLUSION
»CL1:--------------------------------------

I   can   only   stress   how  utterly
»CL0:disappointed»CL1:  I  am  to  see  that  3D
animators   in   the   scene   are  so
»CL0:unimaginative»CL1:  and »CL0: amateurish»CL1:.   Even
those  that choose not to do »CL0:film-like»CL1:
sequences  have  so  far  to go before
producing   anything   »CL0:worth»CL1:  watching
without  some  fancy »CL0: 3D  engine»CL1:  that
makes   it  somehow  »CL0:spectacular»CL1:.   As
»CL0:essential»CL1:  as the animators are to the
production  of  a  3D demo, they don't
put  enough  effort into their work to
»CL0:stand   out »CL1:  in   the   way   coders,
graphicians and musicians do.

There.   Sorry  if  I offended anyone.
You can send hatemail to my »CL0:organizer»CL1:.
He's  so  keen on taking credit for my
work,  perhaps  it's  time he took the
blame for some of it too.  ;)
