 `------------------------------------------------------------------------'

 Welcome back!!

After a one year break we're back and rocking with the next pure Amiga 
old-skool scene party named "Apocalypse". There was not many visitors last
year due to a very badly chosen date (we held our party just a week after




















the famous Mekka-Symposium in Germany), so now we've decided to move
Apocalypse back to September, which seemed to be the best.

The party will be held in the same place as last time, so I hope everybody
will be able to get there without our help ;). Ask us, if you have trouble
finding the place.

What will take place at Apocalypse 3?

Compos, music show with three (or more) DJs(including the czech
"Luxor System"). The czech PC DJ "X-Brain" (or Mozex) promised to come.
We can also promise a big screen and a nice sound at the partyplace, which
has a nice garden as always. We hope to organize some music improvization as
last time, using instruments brought by the visitors. If you have some ideas
how to make some more fun, then contact us. We can make a contract ;).

Apocalypse organizators claim the right to change anything before, during or
after the action (inclusive of the date, fee, party duration, rules, compos
                                   etc.)





















Apocalypse organizators are not responsible for anything that may get stolen
                         or lost during the party!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           THE APOCALYPSE 3 RULES

Both the competitors and visitors taking part in the voting are 
automatically bound to agree with these rules. No objections will be heeded
during the comptetition.

Anybody may take part in the compos. The competitor is not required to be 
present at the party - in such a case, the contribution will be delivered
and the possible prize taken over by a respective subtitute (preferred
persons are mentioned in the readme). It's also possible to send your
competition via e-mail to avoid some organizing problems. If you want to
send entriest via e-mail, do it max. 2 days before the party. E-mails will
help us a lot!

All the contributions must be delivered before the deadline (which will be




















announced at the party). No contributions will be accepted after the 
deadline! The contributions may be sent anytime before the party via e- or
snail mail to Lahve/RSN+MWI or Dizzy/HLA.

EACH contribution MUST include a readme file containing the following 
information:
1) name of the production
2) the author
3) the name of the compo you wish to compete in + any other comments which
   should be shown on the screen during the production.
4) the disc should be labelled with the author's name so that we can return
   it to its owner.

If the above mentioned rules are not respected, the author or the production
name may turn out to be missing in the results, as we simply will not have a
chance of knowing this particular information.

The compo contributions must be original, ie. a result of private work. It 
is immoral and unethical to use other people's work!





















The contributions must meet the criteria set for each compo (eg. the size
limit - see the compos limits). In any other case the contribution will be
disqualified.

For the sake of objectivity, the contributions mustn't be released before 
the competition. Releasing means any way of spreading within the public.
If there is any suspicion of a pre-released contribution it will be 
reassigned to the crazy compo or disqualified.

Graphic and music compo contributions can be used in a demo (intro) taking
part in the demo (intro) compo at the same party. The intro and demo compos
will be held as the last ones. Yet it is very inappropriate (although not
forbidden) to use a compo animation screenshot as a 2D compo picture.

All contributions except for the demos and intros will be presented under
handles (not anonymously as a last time).

The voting sheets will be distributed before the compo. Each voter will
receive one sheet that he/she should sign immediately. Votes cast in any
other form are automatically considered invalid.  Please don't swap these




















sheets between each other.

The voter has the right to renounce voting in any competition or for any
(1st, 2nd or 3rd) place in each compo.

Voters are is not allowed to vote for their own contribution(s) or for the
contribution of their own group.

The evalutation will follow a stated system which you will get to know at 
the party.

After the prize ceremony, all contributions will be available for copying
and eventually downloadable on the Internet. Each contributor automatically
gives his/her permission for this by signing up for the competition. If 
there is anybody who does not wish his/her contribution to be treated as a 
shareware product, the organizers are open to any make possible agreement at
the partyplace.

    SMOKING AND THE USE OF NARCOTICS IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED IN THE ROOM!!!!
  Violating this rule may consequently lead to putting the violator out of




















      the room! This ban will be taken care of by selected organizers.
