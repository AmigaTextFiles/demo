The Party 8?» Expectations? We hoped it
would be better than last year. We
hoped the competitions would not have
as many errors as then, with
competition pictures, intros and so on
being shown after the competition when
very few people were actually
watching. And we hoped that the power
supply would this time actually show
itself as a supply in comparison to
last year's failure.
And of course, we hoped for the same
amount of releases as last year, where
we had no less than 20 Amiga intros
and some 15 demos or so.

»CL0:I arrived pretty late, due to my lack
of talent for getting up in the
morning and due to Danish rail's 
general incompetence. As far as my 
fellow sceners told me (well, »CL1:Loonies»,
»CL1:IRIS» & »CL1:Cromatics»), I didn't actually 
miss anything, except an absolutely
terrible welcoming ceremony. For once
the table reservation system seemed to
have worked (the first time of the 7 
times I have visited The Party), at 
least there was room for me at the 
space I ordered. I had promised to 
deliver some productions for some 
people, and also had to deliver my own
4ch module, and I wanted to get it out
of the way quickly in order to 
actually be able to party, so I went
to the information desk right away to
deliver these. But unfortunately that
was not possible because they wanted
me to deliver the productions over the
net, or at least to have the 
production registered first - which I
altogether didn't mind if it wasn't
for the fact that the net was down at
the time - something which lasted for
several hours...
»CL2:Anyway, finally I managed to deliver
what I wanted to deliver, and went
around to see if I could spot any
»CL3:Amigas» among the »CL3:pc», »CL3:quake», »CL3:mp3», »CL3:porn»
dominated world of The Party - the
»CL3:lamer contra scener» situation has
definitely got worse, and also, many
people decided to bring their pcs
instead of their amy's to be able to
be on the net and so on.
Anyway, I actually could spot a few
Amy's, and even noticed that some 
Danish groups which I had thought dead
and gone a long time ago were actually
working on productions - not famous 
groups, but neverthless, it certainly
is important that we get more than, 
let's say, 10 entries in the demo 
competition, and these people are 
certainly capable of doing it (»CL3:Sumpen»,
»CL3:Skytech»... :). At the time of
speaking, we can also expect demos
from »CL3:DCS», »CL3:Floppy», »CL3:Scoopex», »CL3:IRIS»,
»CL3:Spaceballs» and surely some others.
Also, »CL3:Powdi» (»CL3:Genetic Species» coder) is
also working on a big production for
»CL3:SymMekka» or one of the summer parties.

»CL0:The »CL1:40k intro» competition was shown on
the first day - it was actually the
first competition, and I can safely
say that »CL1:Scoopex» will win again with
the joined coding forces of »CL1:Antibyte»
and »CL1:Optima», and music by »CL1:Deetsay»/»CL1:DCS»,
featuring a lot of routines crammed
down on very little space - the
intro was called »CL1:'1000%'». A just as
sure 2nd position will most probably
be »CL1:Loonies» with »CL1:'The Morning Trip'»
featuring »CL1:Psycho» of »CL1:'GoaTraince'» fame
and last years moral winner of the 40k
competition, »CL1:Blueberry» as coders,
having made a very original cartoon
vector routine. And I guess that
»CL1:Speedo»/»CL1:Loveboat» (didn't he quit the
scene?! And why the hell is the group
named after a crappy 70s soap? :) will
be 3rd, his intro featuring, among
other things, a very impressive
vector/water-routine.

»CL4:Also, the »CL5:JAVA demo» competition
featured a demo made by, among others,
»CL4:Gargoyle»/»CL4:Polka Bros» and »CL4:Spacebrain»/ex.
»CL4:Ambrosia», which will most definitely
win.

And the evil party organizers took
»CL4:Nutmans beer»... Sucks, (fede
skrankepaver, fascistsvin, kummerlige
tåber, !!!!!).

»CL4:This is the time where I rise as a
zombie - a completely new career move,
and it feels as if huge rivers of
grease is slowly flowing down my face
and body, the air being hot and
seemingly filled with the very same
grease, off the skin of the computer
nerds and the boiling hot substandard
fast food ate by them - the air is
so thick you might as well cut your
way through with a knife.

The 4-channel competition was held
yesterday - yours truely hope for a
top-3 position, thus gaining fame and
most importantly, fortune, with my
dosk-pop module. »CL5:Virgill» released his
compotune from »CL5:SymMekka» again, which
will probably make sure that I
won't... :(

Now the demo competition has been
shown. »CL5:Scoopex» will win again with
»CL5:Alien II», another effort by »CL5:Boogeyman»,
but this time his 3D engine is 060
optimized, and it ran 'quite' nicely
on the competition machine - watch it!
No demos from »CL5:Powerline» or »CL5:Spaceballs»
as I had heard rumours about, and 
the one from »CL5:DCS» was IMO quite 
disappointing - I guess that the top5
will be like this 1. »CL5:Scoopex», 2.
»CL5:Abyss», 3. »CL5:IRIS», 4. »CL5:Oxyron» 5. »CL5:DCS»,
»CL5:Loveboat», »CL5:Ephidrena» or something like
that...

The organizers failed to show the
»CL5:Floppy» demo which me & »CL5:Puryx»
delivered, and when he asked them,
whether they would show it later, they
said 'no, it must have been lost
sometime, somewhere' - yeah, great, 
surely »CL5:Maq»/»CL5:Floppy» will love you for
that - incompetent fools!

I also noticed that the picture I
delivered for »CL5:Fame» was shown twice,
once under my handle and once under
his handle - seems the organizers
still can't handle the competitions
after all - but then again, why should
it be better this year?

»CL0:Anyway, let's have a list of the Amiga
groups I have noticed are present 
here - certainly not as many as I
could wish for:

»CL1:Depth», »CL1:Loonies», »CL1:Efreet», »CL1:Cromatics»,
»CL1:IRIS», »CL1:Skytech», »CL1:Sumpen», »CL1:Scoopex», »CL1:DCS»,
»CL1:Rave Network Overscan», »CL1:Polka Brothers»,
»CL1:Abyss», »CL1:Haujobb», »CL1:Loveboat», »CL1:Oxyron»,
»CL1:Spoon», »CL1:Nuance», »CL1:Maximum», »CL1:Factor»,
»CL1:Powerline», »CL1:Nukleus», »CL1:Tulou», »CL1:Agravedict»,
»CL1:Darkage», »CL1:Endzeit» and perhaps a very
few others...

BTW, I wonder why the prizes in the
module competitions are higher than
those in the intro competitions? Looks
unfair to me... Still, if I win the
4ch competition, no bad conscience...
;)
»CL2:(30/12 1998, 15:00)

I'm back home, have slept after being               »PIC:Mattarazzo1»
awake for 39 hours in a row. 
Check the results below, look at the
photographs in the gallery section and
wait for »CL3:SymMekka» -»CL3: THE SCENE PARTY!
