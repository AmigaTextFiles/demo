ªCL8:Intro:

ªCL0:Unfortunately we have less and less
scene parties in hungary each year,
and this isn't really to the advantage
to the scene. The fact that two
quality parties united did not  help
this tendency at all. Actually  this
was the only serious event where the
oldest and youngest members of the
scene were present, the ambience was
good, and the quality and quantity of
the competing works were good. (It's
true that there is only one month left
until the new year, but noone probably
expects too many wonders in the rest
of the year.) Werecievedso much
ªCL1:-unanimous-ª feedback regarding the
ªCL1:SCEnest-Rage'98ª party held in the
summer, that we realized: people
regard this party as the most
important and the best party here in
hungary. We would like to thank all of
you for your appreciation and for the
LOTS of mail you sent. Since the
summer party had such a big success,
we thought that the scene should be
reunited twice a year, for two huge
meetings. The new date however, is not
April (which was ªCL1:SCEneSTª's month), but
January, because this falls the
furthest in time, from theSCEneST-Rage
Megaparty held in July.



ªCL2:This way, you can look forward to a
great event in each half of the year.
But the quality of these parties
depends as much on you, as it does on
us, the organizers. The name of the
new party is also new - which of
course is still like the ªCL3:SCEneST-Rageª
- since we didn't want two parties in
the same year having the same name
(which has been done more than once
in the past). We hope that we can
organize - if not surpass - a
similarly high standard party, like we
had in july. We would hereby like to
invite everyone, and we would like to
ask you to - if possible - compete in
as many compos as you can ! (Amiga,
PC, C64 sceners alike.)

ªCL3: comPoWOP(winner_of_the_party)
ªCL2:
* The title still goes to the best
group of the party. But we had some
problems with the old scoring system,
because only single points separated
the teams. Because of this, we are
introducing a new scoring system,
which might be even simpler, and  more
fair. This means the the teams  will
get points for top 3 ranks, multiplied
by some factor (the factor depends on
which compo the work competed in, of
course the demo compo has the biggest
multiplying factor). The factors can
be read from the table below.  




ªCL1:A quick sample, for those who did
 not fully understand:
ªCL0:
 The total for the GhostBusters team
 from the results

 Demo    2. plc. 1035 pnts 5x = 5175 p
 Trace   1. plc. 1490 pnts 2x = 2980 p
 4K Int. 3. plc.  850 pnts 2x = 1700 p
 Fun     1. plc. 222  pnts 1x =  222 p
 ======================================
                               10077 p

* This way the chance, that two
teams will have exacty the same number
of points is very small, and it will
also be clearer which group was the
best. The multiplying factor is needed
because the winners of the 64k Compo
and the Fun Compo are not on the same
level. This also means, that we don't
have to take into account which place
the group finished in a compo, because
they will get more votes anyway so
their points will reflect how good the
entry is. We would like to take this
opportunity tocongratulatethe
winners of the WOP in summer!

* Everyone who competed in a compo
automatically entered his/her team in
the WOP compo (the FILE_ID.DIZ will
tell us which group the competitor
belongs to).






ªCL2:Dual members will earn points for
thefirst group mentioned in the
FILE_ID.DIZ.

  FILE_ID.DIZ,whichshould contain
  the following:
  The title of the work,
  The name of the competitor,
  The name of the group,
* Which compo the productions is
  competing in,
* Which party the productions is
  competing on,
  And if it's not a PC/DOS
  contribution, then please state so!

 If there are some important facts
 you think we should know in order to
 launch the production successfully,
 then write these infos in a file
 called FONTOS.!!!




ªCL3:Voting:ªCL2:


A small part of the jury will be
selected from the organizers, and a
larger part will be made up of guests
of the party (those who want to be a
part of the jury should report near
the compo machine well before the
deadline of the compo),

Only those that do not compete in
the compo can be a part of the jury,

The members of the jury will award 1
to 10 points to the productions, and
the works with the most points will be
shown in the compos,

The productions being shown in the
compos will be awarded points by the
audience with a scaling of 5 - 3 - 1
points according to which place the
audience rates them.
















ªCL3:Prizes:ªCL2:


We would like to keep our total
prize value of over 5000000 Ft, but to
achieve this, we need sponsors, and
more than 900 visitors - this hasn't
been a problem before, in fact, there
are already some foreigners that have
indicated to us, that they want to
come (even before the invitation has
been released!) - it's interesting
that they knew about the party even
before we did...? =DDD
We will try to award serious prizes
to the winners of every compo, in
addition, we will keep in mind the
quality and quantity of the competing
productions.

We would like to keep the following
ammounts for the Demo compo:
* #150.000 forint
* #230.000 forint
* #320.000 forint

(Ca$h and/or Hardware)
