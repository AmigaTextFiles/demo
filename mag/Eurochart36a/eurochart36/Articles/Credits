»CL8:»SML:--------------------------------------

»CL0:The credits for »CL1:Issue 36» of »CL1:The
Official Eurochart» are as follows:

The »CL1:code» was as usual made by »CL1:Quedax».

The »CL1:main editors» are, as usual, »CL1:Curt
Cool», in charge of votecounting,
support collecting, and writing a few
articles in the bargain, and »CL1:Cytron»,
for compiling the lot, lay-outing the
articles with colours, clip-art etc., 
coding the votetool - basically all
the dirty work.

The big news is that »CL1:Magic/Nah-Kolor»
just joined our staff as co-editor,
and he has been a really busy guy,
writing articles a plenty - looking
forward to see more work from you! 
»CL1:Bucko/Depth&A51» is also a co-editor,
and a few articles from his hand can
also be read in these pages.

»CL1:Additional writers» are
»CL1:Booster/Cromatics» &»CL1: Loonies»,
»CL1:Darkhawk/IRIS» and »CL1:Domin8or/Corrosion»,
whose work you can also enjoy right
here.

The great »CL1:design» was drawn by »CL1:Judas/
Endzeit», and the »CL1:title picture» by
»CL1:Matarazzo/Giants» - thanks!

The »CL1:1st module», entitled »CL1:'Fluids
Running'» was made by »CL1:Ganja/Nerve Axis»
and the »CL1:2nd module», »CL1:'Backbeats
Forever'» was made by »CL1:Psycho/Endzeit&
Appendix».

The »CL1:clip-art» were drawn by »CL1:Budgie/
Absurd», »CL1:Artie/Embassy», »CL1:Fly/Depth»,
»CL1:Matarazzo/Giants», »CL1:ID/Vertical», »CL1:Revi/
Whelpz» and »CL1:Modem/Darkage» - some of
them were originally ment for last
issue, but since we got a lot of
clip-art for that one, and since that
»CL1:Cytron» by mistake ended up using some
of the old clip-arts, well, you can
see them in this very issue!
