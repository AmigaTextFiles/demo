»CL5:        By Magic of Nah-Kolor



»CL9:Proloque
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL2:I always wanted to write an article
about the past of the Amiga Scene. 
Who left, what happened, what I value
and what not. Persons who are dear to
me and left the scene and more topics
like this. Now a couple of months
later, I finally had the time to
realise an article like I wanted.
Somehow it turned out a bit different
:)









»CL9:Yesterday, All My Troubles Were So...
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL2:In earlier days, every demo had »CL3:'some-
thing'» new and fresh. They were total-
ly different. These days demos seem to
be re-runs of »CL3:TBL» routines.. (excep-
tions ignored) .. The first 10 demos I
can think of are The »CL3:Northstar Mega
Demo», »CL3:Hardwired», »CL3:Enigma», »CL3:Substance»,
»CL3:Budbrain», »CL3:RSI Mega Demo», »CL3:Tint», »CL3:Vision
Mega Demo», »CL3:Nexus 7», »CL3:Human Target».
»CL2:Well now isn't this interesting? Only
»CL3:Tint» and »CL3:Nexus 7» are somewhat 'new'
What's happening? The first 6 demo's
was no problem to write at all, the
last 4 I really had to think hard. To
bad Amiga Demo Groups usually only
live about 4 years, because a
»CL3:Kyd/Balle» of »CL3:The Silents» demo anno
domini 1998 would have been really
cool I guess. People abandon the scene
for whatever reasons. They reached
their goals, they get married, getting
too old for what's actually a 'kids
game', realise that they get too
isolated from their social lives or
other reasons. »PIC:Fly1Small»




How many times haven't I heard about
sceners who have troubles at school
because they put to many time in their
Amiga hobby? »CL3:Too much time..» I think
it isn't good for your welfare.. You
have to evolve not only in the Amiga
scene, but in real life as well.. Many
friends, good education, a
girlfriend.. No wonder people invented
the word: »CL3:'Nerd'»


»CL9:Socially Un-elite(?)
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL2:Sceners are mostly males who think
they are »CL3:ELITE». Pioneers of a new
world, where only knowledge and power
counts. Sceners want to know
everything, and have the incredible
need to control their surroundings.
»CL2:Computers are one of the few places
where you can have control, especially
at the internet, simply because
computers do exactly what the user
demands.

These days the Amiga Scene lacks
newcomers. The few talents that enter
the Amiga sociaty where almost
everyone knows eachother somehow, are
guided by experienced sceners, who
have already been around for years.
The talents are mostly young & active,
the older guys do something every now
and than.. This reminds about an
article in ROM#9 .. It's about Infant
of Lemon.. The writer of the article,
defines Infant as the Last Dutch
Coder! Isn't this typical for todays
scene? Maybe, in a few years we can
expect topics like »CL3:'The last Finnish
demo'» or »CL3:'The last Polish picture..'»
»CL3:HOW IRONIC (!) :-)»

»PIC:Mattarazzo2Small»







A total difference between the Amiga
Scene of the »CL3:past» and the Amiga Scene
of the »CL3:present». People always talk
about how »CL3:'The Old Days always were
better'» Obviously.. Reaching new goals
and challenges is the trick to beat
the boring character that invaded
todays Amiga Scene..

»CL9:Epiloque
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:I could have written a list of people
who left the scene and were close to
me.. I didn't... I could have written
the difference between old effects and
the new effects, between demos of
yesteryear and the new ones in 1999 ..
I didn't .. Everybody experience's the
scene different. It will be here for a
long time to come.. But getting
smaller and smaller, until one day,
the last Amiga Scener also decides to
leave.. Until that day I can't vanish
:)
