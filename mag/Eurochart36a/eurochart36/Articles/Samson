»CL0:In »CL1:EC35 Bucko/Depth» wrote something
about the old mag »CL1:"The Word"» and how
people said that they disliked it
because it was done in »CL1:AMOS».

In my opinion I dont mind people doing
stuff like diskmags and slideshows i
»CL1:AMOS». In those productions it is not
the code that matters but everything
else!
So why bother doing it »CL1:ASSEMBLER»?


Well, the first problem a coder runs
in to when working with »CL1:AMOS» is the
huge lack of speed and colours. We all
know that.

So if the diskmag/slideshow needs to
have a fancy design with lotsa 'nice'
3d effects etc, you will have to do it
in ie »CL1:ASSEMBLER».

But maybe these persons disliking »CL1:AMOS»
was only jealous on other people who
had the skills to make something nice
even though »CL1:AMOS» has limitations.

But I must agree, that alot of the
demos you see from newborn groups, who
are not very good at »CL1:ASSEMBLER»
programming, and therefore use »CL1:AMOS»
suck!
Don't you all know these demos with
nothing but flashy screens, dirty
cartoons and texts in some weird
language? I really, REALLY hate them!

The rules for success are the same for
a new group as for the old,
established ones: »CL1:DESIGN!» (even though
almost every demo nowadays lacks this
feature, but that's another story.)

But what about »CL1:AMOS» in general? Is it
useful? I think so.

Everytime I have got a new routine to
do and it includes some hard-to-do
mathemathics I writes it in AMOS
first. Even though »CL1:AMOS» is not the
fastet programming language it is
useful. It is easy to spot the bugs in
the code and optimising (even though
it is probably not easy to see that
the routine has been optimised) is
'easy' done too.

Then afterwards, when the routine
works, I convert it to assembler code.

                    »CL1:VIDEOTRACKER/

                    DEMOMANIAC»
                    demos away from
                    the parties! (no,
                    I dont sympatise
                    with everyone!) :)
