»CL9:Chart Topping Coder Soon A Father!
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL5:POLAND »CL0:- The infamous Polish coder
»CL1:Informer» of »CL1:Appendix» fame will soon be
a father, twenty years of age. Leaving
»CL1:Appendix» and the scene, »CL1:Retro» had a
chance to talk with him at the »CL1:#amisia»
channel at IRC. »CL1:"I'm 20 years old
father in February 1999" Informer»
comments, and continues: »CL1:"It's a boy,
the next best polish coder in the
future"» A last ironic comment by the
infinite Informer. »CL1:"And yes, I am
gonna marry the mother" Informer» says.
»CL1:Informer»CL0: who got a 2nd place at the
»CL1:Gravity party III» in »CL1:August 1998» with
his »CL1:'RIOT'» demo got me a little bit
confused. How could he make such a
demo when he knew he got some one
pregnant? Informer: »CL1:"I just went to
SuperFml's place and we made the demo
in three days"» And here in the very
beginning of 1999 Retro leaves
Informer on his way to fatherhood.
Good luck for the future!

»CL9:TRSI vs Subgroups Gallore
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL5:NORWAY»CL0: - »CL1:Shade» of »CL1:TRSI» claims in
»CL1:Insomnia issue 3» that and I quote: »CL1:"We
want you to look at our sub-divisions
and their names simply as an extension
of the original TRSI. MC IS TRSI and
we work together like ONE group!"» Now
with respect to »CL1:TRSI's» good name, we
can't deny»CL1: Shade» used »CL1:Insomnia» to
describe »CL1:TRSI» in his thoughts no
matter the actual status of today.

»CL1:Kalsu» of »CL1:Mellow Chips»: »CL1:"Mellow Chips
makes demos mostly on their own (some
TRSI guys might help a bit) and then
TRSI releases them"» Magic: So just to
make sure Mellow Chips is Mellow Chips
and TRSI is TRSI ? Kalsu: »CL1:"Right!"»

And here you have the actual truth..
Shade: »CL1:"TRSI is a group who has
outlived ALL of it's competitors at
all times. We have great traditions
going as far back as 1985."» WRONG!
»CL1:Tristar» didn't merge with »CL1:Red Sector» a
loooong time after 1985. Infact from
1996 untill now »CL1:TRSI» haven't released
a single demo and/or intro, except for
»CL1:Mellow Chips» of course.. We hope »CL1:TRSI»
can be like it's Roots in the future,
without a subgroup and ruling the
»CL1:Amiga Scene».. Good luck!







»CL9:Abduction Party Still Didn't Pay Out!
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL5:FINLAND »CL0:- As in earlier years the
annual event »CL1:'Abduction'» didn't pay
it's prices. The 'not paying the
pricemoney' syndrome is found a lot
lately (read: »CL1:The Gathering») But
»CL1:Karpow» of »CL1:Scoopex» was doing his best
to get the price money of »CL1:Abduction'98»
transfered. Karpow: »CL1:"It's a matter of
days now"» he comments. But to be more
certain Karpow says »CL1:"You SHOULD get
the price money by end of this month"»
And what do we know? The end of the
month has passed and still no price
money! 




»CL0:Do we want to support »CL1:Abduction'99» ?
This is a serious question we all need
to ask ourselves. Do we »CL1:Capsule»? Do we
»CL1:MAWI» ? Do we »CL1:Nah-kolor»? Do we »CL1:Zenon»?
All competed on 1998 edition's »CL1:Amiga
demo» competition.. The answer is
simple if they don't pay before The
»CL1:Gathering 1999» is held the scene
should not attend and/or support
»CL1:Abduction'99».. It's your call now
»CL1:'Ari Kurvinen'» the wannabee 'Money   »PIC:Fly1»
Transfering' main organizer of
Abduction parties! Good luck!
