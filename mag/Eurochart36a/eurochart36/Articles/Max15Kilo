»CL3:          by Curt Cool/Depth

»CL2:It's still rather trendy to make
chiptunes these days... Except that
what most people consider a chiptune
seem to be some tune of about
»CL3:30-100kb», which is featuring quite a
few samples. Let me put things
straight:


»CLA:       .THAT IS NOT A CHIPTUNE.





 »PIC:Budgie1»



















»CL0:A »CL1:chiptune» is a module featuring
»CL1:synthetic samples», when talking
»CL1:ProTracker», usually »CL1:small loops» of »CL1:16»,
»CL1:32», »CL1:64» or »CL1:128» bytes, or in »CL1:extreme»
cases, »CL1:SID samples» generated with
»CL1:Pink»'s »CL1:SID sample generator». Most times
some 'real' samples are used as well,
usually for drums and suchlikes, but
the chords should of course be made
with the »CL1:arpeggio command», and the
lead should either be one chipsample,
or a combination of several in order
to create a more varied sound.
Of course specific chipformats like
»CL1:THX» (sorry, »CL1:AHX» ;) is also very much
chiptunes.




»CL4:But who would treat classic tunes by
»CL5:Uncle Tom», »CL5:4-Mat» etc. etc. as
chiptunes - many of those are »CL5:50-100k»,
and should be considered »CL5:serious
tunes», after all they contain »CL5:no
chipsamples» whatsoever. And after all,
»CL5:Sound» by »CL5:Spoon» was never a chippack
though none of the modules were over
»CL5:80k» - and it's not really all that
hard to make a very good module in »CL5:80k»
- so perhaps the musicians have just
gone lazy or are simply not as
talented as in the old days - or show
me this is not the case?
