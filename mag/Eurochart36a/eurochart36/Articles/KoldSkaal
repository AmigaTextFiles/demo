»CL0:Actually I dont see why we should go
on and on complaining about the
problems with inventing something new
in the scene today. Everyone says that
all the old trackmos and megademos
ruled! They had cool design and new
ideas.

Well, at first let me point out to
your (if you dont already
know...nah..I'll do it anyway...) that
it is getting more and more difficult
to think of new routines, since alot
of them already are 'taken' ...

What really should be done is to
»CL1:'remix'» the routines: Use them in
»CL1:another way»! That was what happened in
the old days. They didn't always
invent new rountines - they just
thought of a new way to use it!

And what about music nowadays? Is it
not like the old-styled music with
chords and a nice lead tune? No,
ofcourse not! Like the rest of the
world (and mankind (left space?)) the
scene has been struck by the thing
called »CL1:evolution», which means that
»CL1:THINGS CHANGE»!

I myself am a musician (and I know
that you also are, »CL1:Boris»), and I can't
quite help getting inspired by todays
music and not the old 92 music. Mainly
because you hear the modern »CL1:'noise n
beats'» music more often than you hear
the »CL1:'choords n lead-synth'» music.

»CL9:Conclusion:»CL0: Yes, the innovative scene
is dying so we need to come up with
something new that can save us...but
the answer isn't buried in oldschool
productions!

(Besides...the music in »CL1:EC35» was not
noisy techno..hehe...)
