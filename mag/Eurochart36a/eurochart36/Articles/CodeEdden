»CL0:Yes - we're back once again. Another
coder's course, this time explaining
techniques about:

»CL9:-» Fixed point representation.
»CL9:-» Simple maths behind interpolation.
»CL9:-» Starfield cheating.
»CL9:-» Lookup tables revisited.
»CL9:-» Organizing your code - the first
  smaaaall step towards OOP ;-)




I've written the code for fun and not
for use in this course, so it might be
a little undercommented. I hope, it
will suffice.

As I've also written in my article, I
feel that it is sort of uninspired -
I'll try to make a more exciting
course next time.

Feel free to contact me with any ideas
or perhaps writing your own articles.
You're also very welcome to send in
some problems with sources that you've
made, and want some help with. I'll
then include them along with my answer
in the next Eurochart.
