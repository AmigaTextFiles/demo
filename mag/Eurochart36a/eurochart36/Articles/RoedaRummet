»CL0:It's all beginning to make sense now..
While the clouds were rumbling trough
the rainy sky, the sounds in the 'oral
office' were shaping into the voices
of Shade and Christine De La Queen..
"You will succeed.." Shade of Trsi
whispered in Christine's left ear
while he was on the red-phone with
Robomop. The majority of the
#amigascne population wants the dead
of Insomnia while others are
contra-elimination of the wellknown
puppetmaster Shade of TRSI fame..

»CL9:The Scene Court Of Law
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Can a public figure like Shade of Trsi
do it with Christine De La Queen? Can
he do it while he has the most
responsible scene job of nowadays?
Rokdazone - head of the grandjury -
grumms while looking at all the
evidence. The four tapes of Shade's
hearing were broadcasted on #amigascne
WEB-TV a month ago, and he must now
decide if and when Shade's activity's
should be stopped. Luckily Shade could
afford to hire the best Lawyer in the
entire Amiga Scene: 'Sane of Scoopex'
Shade has still a few tricks behinds
his sleaves before his near
resignation. In the mean time he still
works on the new 4th Insomnia issue..

The evidence is against him. Doing it
3 times with Christine De La Queen,
doing 1 time with Patsy, and he also
had an affair during The Gathering'98
with the main-orginizer's woman, as a
Hidden Agenda, so the MellowChips (of
trsi) demo 'Rise' had a chance to
win..

But Shade is the innocense himself;
"It's all a big conspiracy by Soda of
Darkage!!" he shouts with a vaque
voice.. But then RokDaZone breaks in!
"The impeachment procedures will start
tomorrow! Insomnia issue 3 was the
last bloody issue you ever released!"


»CL9:No Matter What They Tell You...
»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Shade finds himself in a tricky
situation; Sweat is poring on his
entire body, like drups on a leave..
"How can I get myself out of this one"
Shade thinks a bit irritated. Sane
advices him to stay calm, and to let
justice prevail. The statement is as
followed; "Does Shade's sex-life
interfer with his main-editorship or
not?" After reading most evidence,
after hearing most witnesses
(including Lord Helmet and Zinkfloid
aka Uyanik) RokDaZone comes to a
sentence. The court is in a utter
silence. If you listened closely you
could hear a needle fall to the
ground. RokDaZone sits infront of his
a4000/060 without c-gfx card, and
reads the verdict. All other editors
of the writing AmigaScene press have
gathered for this trial of the
century. Soda, Fishwave, Mop,
Kaosmaster, Macno, Cybersonik, Zerox
and Curt Cool. Even Astro is watching
the life broadcast at SceneWebTv. -
Than RokDaZone stands. The final hour
has come!


»CL9:Epiloque
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL1:RokDaZone:
»CL0:"The Scene Court Of Law has come to a
judgement. Though Shade's SEX abuse
isn't a good example for the
AmigaScene, especially for all the
youngsters among us, we think that he
can stay on as Insomnia manager.
However, he must in the next issue of
Insomnia publish a rectification of
his deeds. A 'public regrets' article.
He also must stop all his sex
activity's at once, and focus entirely
on the new »CL1:Insomnia» issue."

»CL1:BANG!»

 »CL1:RokDee» slams his hard-wooden hammer
on the table infront of him, and says
the obvious words: »CL1:"This Court Is Now
Closed, And Out Of Session"»



(*) Sane, wearing his Armani suit,
loudly applaudes like he just 

Shade:
»CL1:"I will, Will... Thanks for having
mercy on my soul!"»

Sixpack:
»CL1:"The impeachment isn't a AmigaScene
Political weapon! Darn :(("»


(*) The ASWPA (AmigaScene Writing
Press Association) goes home and
starts writing huge coverages of the
trial (*)
