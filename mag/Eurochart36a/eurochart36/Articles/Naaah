»CL9:The New Scenish Year..
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Just two years away of going into the
next century, »CL1:Nah-kolor» already
released a demo in 1998 when it was
only 4 days old. Coded by »CL1:Metal
Designer» in a small time period his
Side-fx demo got released at »CL1:The Trip»
party in »CL1:Italy» taking home a first
place. Other people involved were
»CL1:Scout» with his c2p codinx; »CL1:Unreal»,
»CL1:Alive», »CL1:Fra», »CL1:Made» and »CL1:Lowlife» for the
graphics and a very nice tune titled
»CL1:'mod.dawn'» composed by »CL1:Dreamer».
»CL1:SideFx.lha» is a 1.79mb file, which can
be downloaded from aminet or from the
nah homepage. At the same party Unreal
got the first place in the graphics
competition, and »CL1:Metal Designer»
surprised everybody with a first place
in the fast intro coding competition.
This with »CL1:'Sister'» made in cooperation
with the Italian group »CL1:'Elven Eleven'».



In the middle of »CL1:January», »CL1:Traitor» a
highly talented »CL1:Raytracer» in »CL1:Poland»
accepted »CL1:Blaze» his offer and left
»CL1:Phase Truce» to join the »CL1:Nah-kolor»
family. He will be working with »CL1:Klod»
on a demo. Later on in the middle of
»CL1:February» »CL1:Hiv» and »CL1:Blackstrike»
responsible for the magazine »CL1:'Orgazm'»
joined up in »CL1:Poland», making Orgazm a
»CL1:Nah-kolor» release..

In the first half of »CL1:March» Swapper »CL1:QIX»
joined up in Poland since his former
group »CL1:Gods» died. Also PC graphician
»CL1:Warpig» joined up to conquer the Amiga
scene.




»CL9:Die Hard Core Within
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:At the 15th of March at »CL1:Spoletium'98»
party in Italy, »CL1:Nah-kolor» won the 1st
price in the 64kb intro competition.
Nah's »CL1:HardCore Deluxe» intro was coded
by »CL1:Metal Designer», »CL1:Scout» and »CL1:Hedgehog».
Some other members ended rather high
in the graphics and module
competition's.

In the last few weeks of »CL1:April» I
(Magic:) released some articles again.
In »CL1:The Official Eurocharts» issue 33,
in »CL1:Seenpoint» issue 8, »CL1:Retro» issue 3,
and especially »CL1:Generation» issue 26.
»CL1:Raze» of »CL1:Nah-kolor» supported »CL1:Seenpoint»
issue 8 and »CL1:Trashcan» issue 4 with a
»CL1:module», and in the last mentioned
magazine also »CL1:Revisq» contributed with
a tune, composed together with
»CL1:Muffler». »CL1:Unreal» painted the layout
design and title picture for the
»CL1:Official Eurochart» issue 33.

In the first week of »CL1:June», after 10
solid months of hard work and
lazyness:D »CL1:Unauthorized Lands» was
finally released at The »CL1:Abduction 1998»
party. With code by »CL1:Hedgehog» and »CL1:Metal
designer». ALL gfx and design by
»CL1:Unreal», one traced picture by »CL1:Amiflash»
and music by »CL1:Estrayk», it reached a
third place. Also because the demo
bugged on the 060 compo-machine :( But
a week after the party a final 100%
version was released. You can also get
this demo from this homepage.


»CL9:The Summer Is Magic..
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:During the Summer, »CL1:Nah-kolor» released
one huge (5mb) demo at »CL1:Quast'98» which
won the first price. »CL1:BLOW» featured
music by »CL1:Muffler», 3D by »CL1:Traitor» and
»CL1:Amiflash», while »CL1:Warpig», »CL1:Fame», and
»CL1:Visual» did the 2D graphics.. »CL1:BLOW» was
of course coded by Master »CL1:Klod»..

At the »CL1:IntelOutside5» party »CL1:Ripper» of
»CL1:Nah-kolor» released his first intro
»CL1:DIVE» which directly won the 40k intro
compo at this great annual Polish
party. »CL1:Metal Designer» of »CL1:Nah-kolor»
travelled to Poland and met with »CL1:Blaze»
of »CL1:Nah-kolor» and »CL1:Qix» of »CL1:Nah-kolor» and
some other great Polish sceners like
for example »CL1:Zig». They met in between
»CL1:io5» and »CL1:Gravity3» parties in Warszawa.
»CL1:Metal Designer» coded a nice 64k intro
which competed at »CL1:Gravity3» party at
the 30th of August and took home a 3th
place. »CL1:"First they played Md's intro
in the 4kb intro compo, but half way
they stopped it when the orginizers
found out their mistake. Meanwhile the
audiance at Gravity3 said WOOOOW ;)"»,
Qix of Nah-kolor commented the day
after Gravity3. »CL1:"Maq of Floppy was
totally stunned"», Klod of Nah-kolor
commented..

Also during the summer »CL1:Norby» and »CL1:Fame»
rejoined »CL1:Nah-kolor», and also »CL1:Raze» who
left the scene for a couple of months
decided to rejoin. In the same time
some members in Poland were asked to
leave because of no communication with
the group. »CL1:Spark» and »CL1:Ridler» joined up
in Poland also during the Summer.

Another special happening during the
summer was »CL1:Amiflash» of »CL1:Nah-kolor» his
»CL1:VIDEO» demo at »CL1:Intel Outside 5» party.
100% made at his a4000/040 it was a
real beauty, but no match for the »CL1:SGI
Video Demos» for example presented in
the competition..

As some of you might remember when
»CL1:Nah-kolor» got founded in 1995, »CL1:Norby»,
»CL1:Qba», »CL1:Magic» and »CL1:Dreamer» were in the
original formation. Ironically enough
this summer »CL1:Magic» was as usual at home
in Holland, while »CL1:QBA» visited
»CL1:Quast'98», while »CL1:Dreamer» visited »CL1:IO5»,
while »CL1:Norby» visited »CL1:Gravity3». All at
different party's. But »CL1:Qix» commented
that »CL1:Dreamer» visited »CL1:QBA» before
visiting »CL1:IO5» =))
