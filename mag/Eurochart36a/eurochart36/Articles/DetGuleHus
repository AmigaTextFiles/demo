»CL0:We are of course counting on ourselves
- but especially on you to support the
next issue of »CL1:The Official Eurochart».
We need the usual stuff, VOTES,
articles, clip-art, any kind of 
information & news, photographs for 
the gallery & chart sections, 
adverts - the lot basically.












And of course you will be proud to
support us and see your very own
handle in the next issue of The 
Official Eurochart which will be
released at »CL1:Symposium Mekka 2k-1»
and to make it possible for your very
own hardworking editors, the deadline
for everything is set to 

»CLA:20th of March 1999.»
So we cannot guarantee you that
we will use anything submitted to us
after that date.

But of course, don't let that keep you
away from sending it - we are kind
people and try to include everything
we get - though of course articles,
clip-art & modules need to be up to a
certain standard...
