»CL0:The call of nature is infinite.
Diskmags come and dissapear. Lately a
friendly scener by the nickname of
Darkus of Animaters contacted me with
a question I haven't heard in a long
time. Darkus: »CL1:"We are after another
staff member if your interested at
all?"» He got my curiousity there..









»CL9:Introducing The Magazine
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Everybody who wants to set up a new
scene magazine wants to do it in a
different way than all other existing
competative magazines around. Darkus:
»CL1:"It will be different to the usual
mag.. with a different design.. 100%
scene ONLY.. no hardware or amiga
news.. just scene.."» he commented and
continous: »CL1:"Bird of Scoopex is doing
the gfx.. Music is by Fender and by
Virgill, while the code is still be
sorting out.."»
This sounds very    »PIC:Budgie4»
promising indeed.
But clothes don't
make the man as
everybody knows,
so who is the
involved staff,
who will write and
organize the 100%
AmigaScene contents?
Darkus: »CL1:"Staff is
Me, Bird of Scoopex
and Majic Mushroom/
ex-Lemon."» How is
that for a surprise. My old aquentence
»CL1:Majic Mushroom» back on the scene
involved in a hyper elite diskmag
project. This raises expections :)
»CL1:"The name of our mag is called
'MagaScene'"» Darkus comments..
»CL9:Other Informations
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:These serious plans makes the »CL1:Amiga
Scene» so special. There is always
popping up a new diskmagazine which
could play a leading role the next few
years. »CL1:"Bird is sorting out a coder..
we have a announcementro coming out
soon.."» Darkus comments. »CL1:"We are just
starting to get in article support
now."» he continued.
Then I wanted to know a little bit
more about the lay-out. »CL1:ROM» like?
Maybe in the old »CL1:RAW» style? Seemed I
was wrong at both occations. Darkus:
»CL1:"The panel will be different. The idea
of the mag is a little different. Its
hard to explain I will show you when I
get the gfx on my hd!"» A nice
gesture..
»CL9:Epiloque
»CL7:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
»CL0:A new diskmag.. And A quite promising
one to. We wish them all the success
in the world, and hope this 'announce
article' will help in getting even
more support. »CL1:"We will not censor


  »PIC:Mattarazzo2»












anyone's articles.."» Darkus eventually
lies to rest. Hopefully this rule
brings more motivation for the TOP 20
scene writers aka editors in Charts
around. Support this new scene mag!
