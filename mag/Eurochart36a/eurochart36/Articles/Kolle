»CL8:Proloque 

»CL0:Since the last issue of the »CL1:Eurochart»
I promised »CL1:Curt Cool» another column.
Time travelled by in hyperspeed and I
am already 2 weeks late with this
column; But I think I am still on time
to e-mail it to »CL1:Curt»'s lair in
Denmark.. Welcome to 1999 folks (:


»CL8:The Moral Of The Scene

»CL2:In last issues column I dedicated some
lines to »CL3:Antibyte» of »CL3:Scoopex»; Of
course people mis-interpitated what I
ment with those writings and thus I
was forced to write a rectification on
that stuff.. Infact »CL3:Antibyte» is one of
the best coders in the scene, however
he has never coded a demo the last few
years only his truely excellent
intro's, that's why there is still an
aspect missing for him to demand the
number one throne..

»CL2:Talking about Scoopex», things are
going great for this group. New
aquicitions on the Amiga Scene Market
(»CL2:ASM») ensured the continuation of this
group for the coming year atleast.
»CL2:Rumours say that they also have a »CL2:PC
version of Alien 2», which could ensure
their breakthrough on the PC platform
also.. Scoopex looks like the followup
to »CL2:The Black Lotus» in there active
days, »CL2:1999» will tell if »CL2:Scoopex» can
make their ambitions a reality.. Good
Luck..

»CL8:Dan^Lemon Back To His Roots..

»CL4:Four nights prior of writing this
column, I met my old aquantence »CL5:Dan» of
»CL5:Lemon» at »CL5:#amigascne».

Yes, the infinite »CL5:Core Design» coder
who released his massive »CL5:NINJA» game
just last christmas.. The same person
who we brought to the airport in our
small bus after »CL5:The Party 1993». (And
he still has that long hair :-)

The thing is, and »CL5:The Official
Eurocharts» reported it first, »CL5:Dan» is
»CL5:back in the scene» to make a »CL5:new Amiga
demo». »CL5:"It will be a a1200/020 demo,
but you dont need to have a powerful
cpu to make a BEAUTIFUL demo"», »CL5:Dan»
comments. And looking at what Nerve
Axis did with »CL5:Relic», »CL5:Dan» is totally
right indeed.. 

»CL8:Retro Magazine Among The Living..

»CL0:For all people who thought »CL1:Retro» died
out, the joke was on you.. (Was it?)
If everything goes right »CL1:Retro» is on
the final stages to be released with a
new killer staff (»CL1:Soda»,»CL1:Magic» and »CL1:Sane»)
with a massive contents, a new code
and layout and of course 4 modules to
enjoy a nice afternoon of reading the
latest in »CL1:Amiga Scene new&stories»..
There is still time to send your
support and convince Soda to be a
little bit more active at
»CL1:RETRO@SOFTHOME.NET»

»CL1:Retro» - »CL1:Just Some Porn For The Mind..
»CL8:Epiloque

»CL2:The Final until the next one.. How
many »CL3:Eurochart» issues will be released
before »CL3:Depth» hands there legacy to a
new group? How many more columns can I
write before »CL3:Curt» isn't a student
anymore.. It's just for »CL3:1999» to find
out. Rest me to say that »CL3:Nerve Axis»
will win »CL3:The Party 1999», as they will
not compete at Assembly this year but
they will wait until »CL3:The Party»..
