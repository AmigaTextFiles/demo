»CL8:                            What to do, what to do
»CL7:                           Feeling lonely and blue
»CL8:                            My lovely girl left me
»CL7:                          Her dog pissed in my shoe

»CL8:                             I will never forget
»CL7:                            The morning was bright
»CL8:                             But I was not happy
»CL7:                         We'd been fighting all night

»CL8:                            She packed her things
»CL7:                          Ran screaming out the door

»CL7:                      she yelled, and I saw her no more

























»CL8:                            "It wasn't like that",
»CL7:                               I tried to call
»CL8:                           They didn't even want me
»CL7:                           I had to rape them all!

»CL8:                         Now it's nothing left to do
»CL7:                           Some day I'll go to hell
»CL8:                          Satan will come to get me
»CL7:                           How can things end well?

»CL8:                             I have a little hope
»CL7:                          Inside I am still smiling
»CL8:                            Maybe Satan has a wife
»CL7:                            a sweet little thing?

»CL8:                         Well, you should know better

»CL8:                          The answer is really easy
»CL7:                          I'll simply rape her too!
