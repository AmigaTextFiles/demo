»CL4:prologue & introduction:
»CL0:Being a scener today is far from easy.
 Being a scener here in »CL1:Yugoslavia» is
at least 10 times harder. It makes
scener more hardcore or just kills him
in a few years. The strongest survive,
and I, being one of the founder and
organiser of »CL1:CoRRoSioN» - the Yugoslav
scene group with the longest tradition
and history, probably feel lot more
about the scene than average scener
does.


»CL4:the past:
»CL3:YU»CL2: scene was quite deorganized for
years, at the same time having many
high quality sceners. It easily could
have been dead today and noone would
ever know that there were some people
scening in Yugoslavia for many years!
Although risk was high, things never
went to that direction - nowadays yu
scene is making »CL3:giant leaps» to become
a respected member among the rest. Our
group's efforts are surely one of the
most important in this process - from
»CL3:May'97» we organized »CL3:3 SCENE STRIKE»
demo parties and »CL3:9 UPDATE»'s - our
original invention and idea all off
you should consider use to spread the
word about the scene among existing
and potential sceners.

»CL4:the present:
»CL6:UPDATE»CL7: is monthly event, most closely
described as »CL6:DEMO SHOWDOWN». It
presents the latest computer demo
scene creations, also known as »CL6:DEMOS»,
released around the globe, mainly on
various demo scene parties. It also
presents yugoslav demo scene
productions released on two existing
regular demo parties - »CL6:SCENE STRIKE»
and »CL6:YALP». Special care is given to a
rising number of non-party releases.

Originally created to show demo scene
productions to both scene and
non-scene audience, it became far more
than that - »CL6:UPDATE» became important in
life of sceners as a guide to the
latest events on the scene, providing
visitors with both creative and
technological inovations in the world
of underground computer art - the demo
scene. It gives them a chance to see
and get loads of stuff they are not
always able to follow - our dedicated
crew shares its knowledge and position
in order to spread the word and
support yugoslav sceners. And the
visitors gets all this absolutelly for
free! No entrance fee has been nor
will be set - this is a scene event
organised for both our and rest of the
scene's joy.

»CL6:UPDATE» became a social point which
helps sceners to stay active, giving
them motivation and providing them a
place and time to discuss about their
current and future projects.

»CL7:It's up-to-date program is often
enriched with special events like demo
scene retrospective, exclusive update
scene releases, hardware
demonstrations, computer-art magazine
promotions and whatever might interest
an average wild animal known as
scener.

»CL4:the future:
»CL0:Supported by »CL1:Cinema Rex» cultural
center and its subsidiary cybeRex,
»CL1:UPDATE» promises to bring even more in
1999! stay tuned.
