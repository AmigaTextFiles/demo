»CL0:Watch out, feel this need and be
prepared. After all this time in the
scene, and writing for dozens of
magazines, I am back to upgrade the
contents of the EC :-)

Of course the EC is here to conquer
the heart of the scener, the reader,
the symbols of eternity.. In a fresh
new scene year, the last one before
going into the 21st century, the 36th
issue of the EC is finally published
and distributed.

before..? (: " 


»CL9:Introduction..
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:A new scene year has started and why
not start this year with another
Magical Moments corner? Another?
Another? Yes, I wrote the first one
back in 1995 which eventually got
published in »CL1:Plugster's BUZZ#8»
released at »CL1:The Party 1995». An
advertisement to this corner was even
published in the Trinity diskmag
preview issue released in July 1995.

                   »CL9:Nothing Is For Free
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Trough the years there have been
several corners in diskmagazines. Most
famous is without a doubt The
Marvelous »CL1:Lunatics Ball» by »CL1:RokDaZone»,
but also »CL1:Da Press» in some old »CL1:ROM»
issues where very nicely written by
»CL1:Posdnuos» and »CL1:The Ripper». »CL1:Macno» even
acted as a columnist with his
»CL1:ABNOMINIO»'s but these were all
articles which were standing on their
own. Now »CL1:Magical Moments» is back to
(hopefully) frequently appear
troughout all »CL1:EC» issues in »CL1:1999» (for now:)
»CL9:The First Light Towards 2000
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:1999, sounds kind of old. Almost going
into the next century, what does 1999
has in store for the all of us? More
demos and diskmags? New scene groups,
yet another winning ASM demo by Nerve
Axis? We have to let nature take it's
course and find out. Maybe the PPC
gives birth to more demos so we
sceners have a new demonstration to
play with.

I hope you all
will have some
pleasant and
entertaining
nano-seconds
in reading
this corner
and I hope to
receive some
reactions soon.
