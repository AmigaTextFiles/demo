»CL8:     »BIG:YALP '99 Pre-Invitation
»CL9:»SML:--------------------------------------


»CL1:Place:

»CL0:We have a new partyplace, it's no
longer the Fest. It's much nicer, but
it's awfully hard to explain how to
get there, so let's not bother you
with it until the final invitation.

»CL1:Time:

»CL0:Looks like the »CL1:Yalps» are doomed
(except the worse ones, that happen in
years divisible by 666) to happen
close in time to the Scene Strikes. We
will try to get them as far from each
other as possible, »CL1:Yalp'99» will be
held in the »CL1:second half of January». It
will most probably »CL1:last only one day».

















»CL9:Compos:»

»CL1:PC demo »CL0:
As usual, animations are allowed (if
you're not too embarrassed to use
them) and the demo can't exceed 8 megs
in size.

»CL1:Amiga demo»
Same as PC demo, except the obvious
difference in the machine.

»CL1:PC intro»
Max. 64k. Intros are traditionally the
weakest category, so feel free to
bring anything shorter that 64k (even
4k intros.)

»CL1:Amiga intro»
64k max, too.
»CL1:C64 demo»
Does anyone still make this sort of
thing around here? Max. two full
disks.

»CL1:4ch»
Only .MOD format, max. 700k, only the
first 3 minutes of the module will be
played. They'll be played on either PC
or Amiga.

»CL1:Multichannel»
They'll be played in Cubic Player on
PC and HiP on Amiga,  so you better
use some format they can read. Max. 1
meg and  only the first 3 minutes will
be played.



»CL1:C64 music»CL0:
Must be executable, only the first 3
minutes will be played.

»CL1:Pixel»
Up to 640x512 in 256 boja.

»CL1:C64 pixel»
If there's only one or two, they go
together with the other pixel entries.
They too must be executable.

»CL1:Raytrace»
Only pure raytrace, no photoshopping
or anything. Fractals and  other
program-generated pictures are still
welcome.



»CL1:24bit gfx»
The former Photoshop compo. Do it in
any program, but keep in mind that we
want real art. Scans and grabs will be
dis- qualified. The entries in all gfx
categories will be shown on both Amiga
and PC (except C64 pixel, for
hairsplitters.) 

»CL1:256byte megademo»
We only count on PC megademos, but it
would be nice if  you'd surprise us
with something else. Just let us know 
ahead.

»CL1:Ascii»
They'll only be shown on Amiga, except
if you overwhelm us with requests for
them being shown on PC too.

»CL1:Useless utility»CL0:
You'll have to demonstrate it yourself
(unless it really  needs no
interaction).

»CL1:Wild/animation»
"Wild" generally includes all kinds of
slideshows and "exe" animations, if
you're planning anything more exotic
(or anything above 1gb) let us know
ahead.

»CL9:Preselection:

»CL2:If there are really too many modules,
we'll have »CL3:preselect» a reasonable
number of the best and play only
those, to avoid boring people to
death. In other compos this won't be
done, but totally idiotic entries will
be eliminated regardless of the compo
they' re in and the total number of
entries. 

»CL9:Compo Machines

»CL1:PC
»CL0:P2/233 (yes, we could have got a
faster one, but it wouldn't be
appropriate for a demo party) 128m
RAM, Tseng ET6000, GUS 1m 

»CL1:Amiga»
A1200, Blizzard PPC603/060, 32m Fast
RAM..

»CL1:C64»
PAL VIC, new SID, 1541-II


»CL9:Prizes
»CL4:
Why are you interested in »CL5:prizes»,
isn't it enough to »CL5:participate» ;)

You know it's not very wise to promise
exact prizes in advance, but we
promise that among other things one
real computer will be awarded (no, not
a »CL5:C64»)

»CL9:Improvements:

»CL0:In cooperation with »CL1:NASA» experts, we'
ve discovered a new method of starting
compos real soon after the deadlines.
So this time nothing will be late.
