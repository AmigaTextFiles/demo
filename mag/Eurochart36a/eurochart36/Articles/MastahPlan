»CL9:Proloque

»CL2:It's Amiga Scene.. It's Glory, Fame,
Ambition and Eagerness.. Reaching the
top as a goal within every scener,
though not everyone realises it. The
scene is fluctuating.. Trough the
years certain countries dominate the
scene, and certain groups have a big
impact towards the scenish community..
The question is why certain groups
have a big impact and other have not!




»CL9:Try to compete at the big party's
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL2:The biggest reason of course are the
productions released. Productions
speak for themselves. However to have
a big impact on the scene, groups have
to get high rankings at the major
party's like »CL3:Mekka/Symposium», »CL3:The
Gathering», »CL3:Assembly» and »CL3:The Party»..
Now I don't know about you, but I have
seen groups who released more and
better productions the last two years
than certain other groups who are
ranked a lot higher in Charts around
while releasing almost nothing. The
difference is they released at a big
Party. 
»CL2:Another remarkable fact is if you look
at the »CL3:DEMO» categorie in the »CL3:Official
Eurochart»s, »CL3:99%» of the demo's present
were released at the big party's named
above. 


»CL9:Polish Scene vs Western Civilasation
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL2:As everybody knows the »CL3:Polish» scene is
the biggest and most active around.
Most groups are far more productive
and/or better than a lot of western
groups, however »CL3:Polish» groups hardly
reach the »CL3:BIG» party's of the west. Get
the picture? Some Polish groups are in
the »CL3:BEST GROUPS» charts, but their
demo/intro's are nowhere to be found
in the charts for these categories.

       »PIC:Revi1»








The big parties get more attention,
huge coverages by diskmagazines, and
the demos are better spread than on
other smaller parties. Groups like
»CL3:Scoopex», »CL3:Haujobb», »CL3:CNCD», »CL3:Abyss», »CL3:Nerve
Axis» release their demos on the big
parties and their productions are
ranked very high in charts around.
Productions from groups like »CL3:Venus Art»
or »CL3:Floppy» are almost in no chart
around.
»CL9:Epiloque
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL2:Some groups are in charts because of
their huge history, no matter what the          »PIC:Artie1»
achievements look like in the recent
past. Releasing one demo a year at a
huge party is enough to uphold their
chart rankings. While other younger
groups achieved much more in the same
time period. Maybe it's time to
release a new sort of charts, based on
more recent (actual) achievements?

None the less, if you want your group
to get more attention in an easy way,
you know what the masterplan should
look like. Ain't it?
