»CL0:Yes my debut corner in the »CL1:EC» is
a fact.. I hope you all liked it..
Sadly enough this should have been in
»CL1:Retro» issue 4.. »CL1:Soda» of »CL1:Darkage» and me
worked alot on it, but we didn't make
our ambitions to a reality. I haven't
heard anything from »CL1:Soda» the last 4-5
weeks, not on irc not even an e-mail.
This while we planned to release the
4th issue in this time period..
Luckily my old friend »CL1:CurtCool» was
here to save the day, and I will
support him from now on.. Sorry to all
involved people in »CL1:Retro» but it wasn't
ment to be I guess.. Read on about
some Scenish things before I say the
last words of this issue :)


»CL9:About Zig of Floppy..
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:We all do know this »CL1:Polish» coder. One
of THE coders at the moment. With his
winning »CL1:Intel Outside Party 1998» demo
he conquered the hearts of thousands
amiga sceners in Europe. With years of
coding in the background leading to
his succes now. Ironicly enough I just
found out 2-3 months ago that when I
was on Holiday in »CL1:Poland» in 1994 (!) I
was almost near his house, since I was
staying in the same city Zig lives in:
»CL1:'Katowice'» ... Even more ironic, when
I was main-editor of »CL1:THING» magazine, -
and I didn't remember it untill 2-3
months ago - »CL1:ZIG» did the intro for
Thing's first issue :)) (Released end
of 1993 (!) Who said miracles do not
excist?? :))


»CL9:Anarchy's Main Coder On Dutch TV 
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:These wild days of »CL1:1998», we can't go
around all those consoles. On TV
programmes are made with all the
latest reviews, items, news of those
console games. And what a nice 3D
sequences are to be seen in those
games.. Anyway I was watching »CL1:'GAME
ZONE'» on the dutch TMF channel, when
there was an item about »CL1:Core Design».
And who was sitting in the middle on
the screen? Right! »CL1:Dan of Anarchy»! The
mighty coder behind for example the
»CL1:Legalise It 1+2» music disks. The same
coder who I met at »CL1:TheParty1993», and
who we brought to the Airport when
TP'93 was finished in our car. 

This time he was coding on a »CL1:Ninja
game». Few screenshots were shown, and
it really looked aswesome... Again a
few questions were being asked. I
remember »CL1:Dan» said something that he
wanted the old gaming of the 80's to
be found back in (his) new '3D'
console games of the late 90's.. :))

It was a funny experience, and now
looking back it still is :) Two months
later »CL1:DAN» decided to rejoin the Amiga
Scene and a new »CL1:Lemon.» demo is in the
making by him..


»CL9:Epiloque
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:As always I tried this ending article
to be 100% »CL1:'AmigaScenish'» .. Even this
ending article.. Hope you liked it!
(As much I did writing it :)

I will (hopefully) ofcourse :) be back
later in 1999 with a new edition. At
least in »CL1:EC» issue 37 ? »CL1:CurtCool» and I
will try to anyway.. =) 

In the meanwhile have a nice time with
the rest of this EC issue!
