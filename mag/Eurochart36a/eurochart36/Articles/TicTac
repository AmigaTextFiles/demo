»CL2:Group's are the 'building stones' of
our scene. Groups shape the Amiga
Scene, without groups like for example
»CL3:Nerve Axis», »CL3:Depth», »CL3:Endzeit», »CL3:Floppy»,
»CL3:Capsule», »CL3:Mellow Chips», »CL3:Nah-kolor»,
»CL3:Abyss» or »CL3:Skarla» there wouldn't be any
scene. A logical fact, but what's this
article really about then? It's about
a certain irritating factor in the
scene that is denying this logical
fact to excist.



»CL9:The Dominating Big Scene Groups
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL2:Is the scene to blind to see whats
happening? Or are we just denying it
all? The big and known groups are
attrackting key-members from other
groups to keep the name breathing.
Of course in the past this already
happened every now and then, but today
with e-mail and IRC its very easy to
do this. For example just recently
»CL3:Scoopex» attracked THE coder from the
Danish group »CL3:Depth». Without this coder
(read: »CL3:Optima» of »CL3:Depth») »CL3:Depth» can
hardly release anything but the
»CL3:Official Eurocharts». »CL3:Depth» can't grow
to a TOP group.
»CL2:The sometimes historical name, or
atleast known and famous name of the
bigger group(s) seem to be a free
ticket to attrack any coder, musician
or graphician the orginizers need. An
advantage surely, but if they use it
to attracked for example the best
coder of a 'middle class' group (read:
»CL3:KEY MEMBER»), this group will never
have the chance to grow even bigger.
Aren't the big and famous groups
destroying the scene this way, aren't
they selfish?

»CL9:The Talents Stream Across The Scene
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL2:Like I wrote in my column for »CL3:The
Official Eurochart» issue 35, known
groups actually become some kind of
label. Some are even using this method
for years. Why can't they just attract
members who aren't the »CL3:'driving force'»
of other not so known groups. If the
big groups don't ask, the not so known
groups have a chance to reach the TOP,
which will benefit the Amiga scene for
sure.. Otherwise it's obvious who will







have the highest rankings the comming
years.. How boring..
»CL2:Few top groups are even dominating the
'talents stream' across the scene.
It's like soccer I guess. Look at the
most famous soccer team in your
country, they are headhunting the best
players (members) of other 'smaller'
soccer teams as well. No matter if the
'smaller' team had better results the
last one or two years. The famous /
legendary name of the BIG team is
enough to get the players they need.
Just like what is happening in the
Amiga scene of today.





»CL9:Epiloque
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL2:This is really a negative developement
of the electronic highway facility's
like E-mail and IRC. Though the known,
big groups always release quality
releases, the smaller, not so known
groups don't have a chance to evolve,
no matter if they have a better
history than the known group in the
previous year(s) before. It's simply a
matter of Scene Ethics..
