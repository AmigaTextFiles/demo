For optimal performance, play the module on one computer
and execute the intro on another (synchronized of coz!). 
In this way it was done under SCC'97 party. Nevertheless 
in a true Nukleus style!

Please notice that Starforce.exe is embedded in a bonus-archieve
under the diskmag Cows n Snakefights #5 and therefore, Nukleus
only wants it spread that way!
