»CL9:»SML: --------------------------------------

»CL4:             By Curt Cool
»CL0:
»CL1:CC:»CL0: Hey Michael - please introduce
    yourself to our readers - like,
    where you live, how old you are
    and so on - because, erm, that's
    the best way to start a scene
    interview I think.
»CL3:M!:»CL2: Hello Curt Cool! 
    Well my real name is Michael. I
    live in a large town called Herne
    Hill, which is basically in the
    South of London. I work full time
    for Mercury Communications as a
    Network Manager. During the
    weekends I work with my uncle at
    his Music Studio in Hastings (East
    Sussex) where he has a contract/
    full time business making music
    and effects for the Cable
    Television Channel called -The
    Cartoon Network-.
   
»CL1:CC:»CL0: You have been hanging around on
    the Amiga scene for a long time,
    perhaps you could enlighten our
    readers about your scene career
    as well?
»CL3:M!:»CL2: My computer Career in the scene
    started in 1988 with the Commodore
    64 where I was a Musicican for a
    team called Sanxion! And then I
    swiftly move onto the Atari Falcon
    and Atari St in 1990 where I was
    in a group called Delta and my
    main functions there was, Music
    and Programming (That's Music
    Programming).  During the Mid 1990
    I brought myself a Commodore (Tm)
    Amiga A500 and decided to try my
    luck with writing modules and
    designing Demos! What people
    didn't know is that I still 
    continued my activities on the
    Atari Falcon Machine up until
    1993! My first ever group on the
    Commodore (Tm) Amiga 500 was End
    Of Centry 1999 in which famous
    people like Hollywood/Mono,
    Subculture was in this team (What
    a year!). I was then given the
    task of Managing the Uk division
    of this team as well as writing
    Music, And by-God what a task it
    tuned out to be! With People like
    Hollywood Subculture, Blade,
    Stryx, Phantom, Toxic, Bob,
    Brutus, Optic,  Rico, Leaburn, Mr
    Kipp all joining after I had
    joined! The group was getting well
    known in the Uk! I was in Eoc 1999
    for at least 2 years and then
    decided to branch out and I joined
    Nunace where I respociable for the
    Music and Effects in the trackdemo
    called ** Subtle Shades ** After
    some disagreement with the Germany
    division, I decided to leave and
    join a temporary team called
    delite. I think my biggest mistake
    was to release Pandemonium 2 under
    the delite label (What a shite
    Team it was...) After the release
    of Pandemonium 2 I decided to join
    **Anathema**! Now as far as I am
    concerned about those other
    stories about me              »PIC:Jud1.iff»
    joining Freezers and
    Surprise Productions
    were false and a
    load of nonsense
    talk.
    My article in which
    I slammed down
    Shade dealt with
    that point about
    both teams. So I am
    not gonna discuss
    this matter any
    further! So from
    1993 to now, I am
    still in Anathema,
    and I don't think I
    will leave this team
    as I like it here!





















»CL1:CC:»CL0: What gives you the motivation to go
    on after all this time? 
»CL3:M!:»CL2: I really don't know! I think it's
    become a way of life really. I
    must admit that I do enjoy writing
    music for the Amiga, even though
    those software companys out there
    are a bunch of two-face bastards.
    My work on the Sony playstation
    and Nintendo 64 will always be
    there, But I will never forget the
    Commodore(Tm), Amiga and the Atari
    Falcon computers for all the
    enjoyments I had in making great
    sounds! My motivation comes from
    my team as well as other people
    who ask for my services to write
    music for them, and without this
    sort of help, you can never
    survive. (Long live the Amiga I say!)
»CL1:CC:»CL0: Being a musician, do you have any
    favourite scene musicians?
»CL3:M!:»CL2: No not really. Everyone has their
    taste in soundtracks. But I have
    to say that only a few Musicians
    catch my eye at time to time! And
    they are: Daizl/Mystic, who is is
    really a classic Musician in my
    book, and worth a mention in this
    interview. Hollywood of Mono for
    making a great soundtrack for the
    Trackdemo called Tag! KBX 128 or
    Vim (What ever the the Geezers
    name is) has tremendos style in
    rythum too, (especially with chip
    Modules.) Curt cool for the
    Original chip Modules.  Steven/Rwe
    has to be mentioned here, because
    you wait till you see chip Attack
    2 with the C64 conversions By
    myself and Steven, Some of the
    best ever produced for the 68000
    machines! But I have to say my
    best Amiga Game Musician all round
    has to be David Whittaker and Tim
    Follin! David Whittaker works for
    Electronic Arts alongside the
    classic C64 Musician called Rob
    Hubbard! And as for Tim Follin,
    Well hes in Manchester doing his
    own thing, And you will here some
    of his stunning soundtracks in
    some playstation games soon! Jason
    Follin is great musician too, me
    and him have done a Soundtrack
    together for Chip Attack 2 called
    Fresh Resided..Check out our
    chords in that tune, it's a bit
    like L.E.D storm title Music! I am
    at this moment trying to get Tim


   »PIC:Cyt2.iff»














    and Mike Follin to do the Title
    (Midi) tune for the Cd version of
    chip Attack 2!
»CL1:CC:»CL0: In your scene career, what is
    perhaps the biggest thing you have
    achieved?
»CL3:M!:»CL2: Working on Chip Attack 1 and 2.
    And also getting my Cd Music
    Tracks released via X-Pele System 
    (Revolution Vol 1...) which was
    released last year! I know that
    Chip Attack 2 is long delayed! But
    due to programming enhancements
    and the Gfx Artists delaying the
    title Picture, We had to put this
    program on hold. So I think what
    would make an even bigger
    achievement for me would be for
    people to see chip Attack 2 as a
    European production and not just
    another uk production and say well
    done to me. As I did Design this
    production myself!
»CL1:CC:»CL0: Where do you see demo music going
    in the future?
»CL3:M!:»CL2: How demo music stands now. It's
    really at a lost chord, things are
    becoming very bleak indeed with no
    official backing to keep the amiga
    computer on the market, then
    people will look elsewhere.
    Software companys has pissed off!
    Commodore has closed down! Escom
    has disappeared from the earth it
    seems, And if not then they are
    very quite indeed (Especially in
    the Uk)! What more can happen you
    may ask yourself? I have to say
    this, at least with the PC
    computer there is always
    competitiion in the market to
    upgrade the machine. My opinion is
    this. If any backing was going to
    help the Amiga out of the hole
    they're in, they need to do
    something about the Soundchip and
    Graphics chip and the crusty
    68000. Yes I know there is the
    PowerPC Processors available but I
    don't see any changes so far! I
    spoke to a software company the
    other day and when I told them I
    still do Amiga Music the phone
    went dead for 5 seconds (Obviously
    it's the Joke of the month to
    them?) So if anyone thinks the
    future looks better, then please
    contact me and give me details
    about it!
          »PIC:Cyt1.iff»



»CL1:CC:»CL0: And where do you see the scene
    going in the future?
»CL3:M!:»CL2: It would be great if productions
    can concentrate on the old Skool
    style of work. I enjoyed those
    days. But again, I must remind
    people out there, that the only
    way the Demo scene would stay
    alive is by keeping the
    productions coming! Teams that
    delay productions is another thing
    and I don't mind that, But what I
    don't understand is that, you hear
    a team is gonna release something,
    and then a few days later they're
    dead? Spooky or what! 
    That is why I am concentrating on
    Chip Attack 2 and Deadlock
    Magazine. But I must say that
    Deadlock would be the hardest out
    of all the rest. With the uk scene
    virtually dead? Why have such a Uk
    based Diskmagazine? We will see!
    So again, the direct answer to
    your question is? The future looks
    bleak again!

»CL1:CC:»CL0: How do you see the situation of
    the UK scene at the moment?
»CL3:M!:»CL2: Dead! If anyone can tell me
    different or explain to me
    different, then my opinion stands
    what it is! 

»CL1:CC:»CL0: You are a member of the group
    Anathema, by many thought to be
    the UK's no. 2 group (after Nerve
    Axis) - you haven't released
    anything for some time now, yet
    Chip Attack 2 and another issue of
    the diskmagazine Deadlock has been
    promised for a long time - when
    can we expect these, and what can
    we expect from them?
»CL3:M!:»CL2: Uk number 2 group? I would like to
    know where this source comes from!
    I can understand the frustration
    that some people are going through
    waiting for Chip Attack 2. And I
    agree with all those people who
    criticise us for the very long
    delay! But what I will not accept
    is people who criticise and don't
    do anything themselves. Chip
    Attack 2 is on the verge of being
    released and will be with us in
    Late August/Early September 1998.
    There is nothing really special
    about Chip Attack 2 except for the
    Amazing Graphics and brilliant
    Disk accessing system. This
    production will use a Cyberload,
    which uses a new Operating system
    for the Amiga 1200. Or
    alternatively, if you have acess
    to a CD driver you can place your
    order with me for a CD based
    version of chip Attack 2 which
    will consist of 275 Chip Modules!
    275 Chip Modules I hear you say??
    Well, What we have done for this
    version is add all of the Atari
    Falcon Conversion of Chip Attack 2
    Chip Musics to this CD based one
    and given it a larger size. Also
    the Title, Introduction and
    Endparts Musics is Midi based
    track, And I think Tim Follin
    alongside with myself and
    Steven/RWE will be Making some
    stunning Midi Tracks as well. The
    Disk version will feature some
    nice and neat designs with a Cool
    hidden part featuring a raytrace
    tunnel. There will be over 100
    Chip modules to choose from
    including 40 diffrent C64
    Conversions to select from and
    many more besides. I must stress
    that if you want the Hard drive
    version of this Music disk please
    contact me in Late July! So I can
    put your name down on Hd mailing
    list. Chip Attack 2 looks set to
    come on 3 disks (Sorry!) But again
    we are after quality productions
    and not a rush job..... I had
    asked many people to send in there
    complaints to me about what people
    wanted us to change or implement


    into the second issue (Even 4 USA
    2 Canadians dudes sent me a letter
    of concern as well). Well after
    reading though all of the letters
    I have decided to put all those
    ideas into practise and given the
    coder the choice to implement them
    in our second issue. We want the
    members of public who see this
    production as a product that
    Anathema do lisen and implement
    your ideas too. All I can say is
    wait and see. But those dudes out
    there who wish to contribute
    towards this production.. you
    still have time to do so..Send in
    your Chip Music (Max 50k) to



          Chip Attack 2 Team
            35 Poplar Road
              Herne Hill
                London
               SE24 OBN

    As for Deadlock, I cannot comment
    on that for the moment because
    Outspan/Anathema is re-programming
    this Diskmagazine as we speak. A
    headline intro will be release in
    due course about deadlock! But
    lets get through one thing at a
    time and get Chip Attack 2 out!
    Let Me leave you with The credits

    Disc and Hardrive version)

»CL1:CC:»CL0: As well as being a scene musician,
    you have also achieved what is
    perhaps the dream of many a scene
    musician, namely making music for
    games - perhaps you'd give us a
    full round-up on the games that
    feature and will feature your
    music?
»CL3:M!:»CL2: On the Playstation Music front you
    will be hearing my Music on Mortal
    Kombat 4 I am working on that as
    we speak. I did 2 Soundtrack to Mk
    Trilogy (The Subway & Streets
    Stage) and Xenocide! I also work
    with my Uncle friend (David Logan)
    on the Pitfall 3d Tunes! and
    besides that I have signed a
    contract alongside my uncle with
    X-Trax Development which will
    secure my future with playstation
    Musics. On the Snes and Nintendo64
    side, well Double Dragon on the
    Snes featured some of my Dat
    Musics. As for future games, well
    as know, if your under a contract,
    that makes you not to publish,
    discuss or transmit any thing
    which is in development! Sorry the
    only reason why I spoke to you
    about MK4 is because I know the
    team quite well! Hello Barny! Hah,
    Hah

 

»CL1:CC:»CL0: I have heard you are using a new
    Amiga tracker called TeleTracker
    which should be rather cool - so
    perhaps you could explain a bit
    about that?
»CL3:M!:»CL2: Teletracker is developed by
    Telewest Canada! These dudes are
    doing the Atari Falcon conversion
    of Chip Attack 2 for Anathema Uk.
    This production is C64 Emulator
    Music Tracker...It features 4
    track sequences (just like the
    rest...) I was using the
    Beta-Version of this tracker to do
    my C64 conversion. And what a
    remarkable Tracker it is...You can
    develop your own waveform and
    whats good about it is that you
    can play each voice independantly.
    Not like in protracker! it's is
    Portracker supportive, So you can
    load your chip modules into it,
    but you have to select it in a
    menu selector in the program....It
    also supports big modules too, So
    not only it's a C64 Emulator, but
    a Multi-Program which features
    protracker stuff. You can load in
    a loop sample of 155k which is
    better than the protracker version
    which is 64k...The Teletracker
    program takes 150k only, but put
    some of the program in Fast
    Memory, So you have more chip
    Memory to work with ...All
    replayers that work with
    Protracker will not work unless
    you resave it out as a PT tune and
    have the standard M.K to the label
    of your tune! A Nice program it is
    and I am not gonna compare it with
    any other trackers because this is
    where people starts to critise
    each other program and I am not
    into that. The Amiga version will
    be ready in 2/3 months time a beta
    test version is now out! So check
    it out dudes! This Teletracker
    will not be Shareware! All
    prgramming for this Program is
    Written By TZA (The Sucker who
    coded it! Hello Tony!!!!)

»CL1:CC:»CL0: In 1997 you were involved in some
    kind of slagging-off match with
    Alive/ Nah-Kolor - perhaps you
    would like to explain the
    situation from the more relaxed
    point of view you probably have
    now, a year later?
»CL3:M!:»CL2: Alive of Nah-Color
    (Real Name: Marcel          »PIC:Cyt4.iff»
    Bramothe) was acting
    like a Gay Folly
    really, And I just
    had to put him in his
    place really! (Hello
    Alive how are you??
    Hah, Hah) But I must
    admit that I did go a
    bit to far with my
    actions. But hey? It
    was fun though! To
    explain this in
    details to you would
    take time, And to be
    quite honest with you
    I have better things
    to do than to reap up
    old stories like this
           ...Let look to the future
           and forget the past! Most
           of the things I did say
           was well out of order! but
           80 percent of it was true.
           But again he had said what
           he had to say, and to be
           quite honest with you I did
           not care really (obviously
           the section about his
           trousers must've pissed him
           off to write an article
           back). That was really
           funny (Hah, Hah) Did I tell
           you that Alive wants to
           become an member of the Uk
           Government! Nice eh? we can
           all see it now Marcel
           Bramothe - MP for Lewisham
           East! (Ha, Ha) only Joking!



                   »CL1:CC:»CL0: Any other things you would like to
                       mention here - greetings, ...
                       anything really...?
                   »CL3:M!:»CL2: A big hi To Daizl/Mystic, Geist
