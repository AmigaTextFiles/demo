»CL4:             By Curt Cool

»CL9:Warning!»CL0: This is an article made only
with the purpose of making you think
that in fact this issue of »CL1:The
Official Eurochart» features plenty of
articles, which is in fact a plain lie
- or perhaps it is not, if you
consider a filler an article, in which
case it is is completely filled
(argh!) with articles.





But in fact that was not the purpose
of writing this article, no, it was
simply to teach budding editors how to
write fillers themselves, a knowledge
which will come in handy 2 hours
before deadline when you just need to
fill out that spot which is missing
the name of an article so much.

Because we're 2 hours before deadline,
it is usually too late (or
alternatively, the editor is too
tired) to contact some famous scener
for comments on his group's rise or
fall or to make an interview. So what
you have to do is to find some topic
which is almost new to the scene (not
'Too Many Swappers', 'Too Many
Diskmags' and so on) and perhaps quote
a bit from other people who has
written some things about the subject.
Then you serve your own
well-argumented opinion on the subject
(if you don't trust your own abilities
in discussions, don't read further,
and don't try this kind of articles
;), fill in with some pseudo-
philosophical squabble, and end up
with comparing the scenish situation
to the real world, just to spice the
whole thing up a bit. But remember to
make the comparation relevant - eg.
don't compare scene charts which
people vote on to record charts which
only signifies the sales of records,
the two things being completely
different (this was just an example
of how not to do taken from the 
latest issue of a certain other famous
diskmagazine).
To make the article fill a bit more,
be good at English and use long and
advanced words which will also impress
the people and make them think that
you are an amazingly good editor.

And a final notice: If you want to see
more fillers of this style, just check
about every article I, »CL1:Curt Cool», have
written so far.
