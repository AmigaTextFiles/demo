»CL4:             By Curt Cool


»CL0:By popular demand we have decided to
hold yet another »CL1:25kb module
competition», so that you musicians can
once again let your abilities be heard
by the public ear, the best one of you 
winning a very special prize in the
process - doesn't that sound just
great?

The rules are the same as last time -
but since last time was some time ago,
we'd better repeat them:





»CL8:*» The size of the module has to be
exactly »CL1:25600» bytes - no more, no
less.

»CL8:*» The module has to be in »CL1:mod. format»
- no xm's, med's, dbm's, thx's etc.
etc.

»CL8:*» The deadline for delivering a module
is on the »CL1:15th of September» 1998 -
leaves you plenty of time so get
composing!

»CL8:*» Modules should be delivered to »CL1:Curt
Cool» (curtcool@image.dk) or »CL1:Cytron»
(6820@e.aarhus.ih.dk).
