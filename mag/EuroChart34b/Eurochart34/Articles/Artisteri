»CL4:             By Curt Cool

»CL0:In »CL1:Generation» there has been been some
heavy debate between the two
main-editors whether demos are »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» or
not - and just to put the discussion
out on a larger scale, this »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t»icle
will be published in the »CL1:Euroch»»CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t»,
because, as the dear »CL1:Ripper» puts it,
the dogma is closed, and the
discussion is opened - and as I really
like a good discussion, well, I will
have to write this.

Because if you have to find out
whether demos are »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» or not, you will
have to know what »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» is - and perhaps
you may have an opinion about it, but
the fact remains - there is definitely
no clear definition of »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» in todays
society, it is often discussed what
can be described as »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» and what
cannot - but a final, crystal clear
definition has never been reach,
however loud the »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» v.i.p.'s of the
real world have been yelling at
eachother.

Some would say that »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» has to have a
statement in it to be »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» - but then,
how about eg. portrait paintings from,
let's say, the 16th century - they
certainly do not represent anything
else than prettiness and the fact that
person/persons painted had enough
money to have their picture painted - 
but still, I'm sure you will agree, 
it is »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t».

Some would say that »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» is simply
something which pleases the eye, but
on the other hand, many young »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t»ists
define themselves as »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t»ists when
making strange installments of stuffed
animals, crashed cars and doing weird
happenings - simply to make people
think - and no doubt, that is also a
kind of »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t».

And how about music? Something which
pleases the ear or something which is
so good it sends shivers down your
spine? Musical taste is also an
endless discussion, and comes pretty
close to the discussion of »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t».

So, perhaps, just perhaps, »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» is not
a thing which can be clearly defined
once and for all, for all people all
over the world - no, the creations
which move you in some way are »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» for
you, and the creations which move me 
are »CL4:a»»CL5:r»»CL6:t» for me - it is a personal
thing, a floating definition, and
certainly not something just definable
out of thin air. 

Did I end the discussion or just sound
pseudo-philosophical? In case of the
latter, sorry.
