»CL0:In issue 33 of this mag I'm quoted of
having said: »CL1:"Coders who do not finish
their productions simply lack self
disclipline."»

It's true - I said that but like in
all other more or less journalistic
medias quotes can be misused. My point
was: It seems to me as some coders
simply are not able to finish their
productions. Some have more unfinished
projects on their harddrives for which
they have asked artworkes and
musicians for specific graphics and
sound. This is the core of my
statement: If you start a project and
involve other people, who invest a lot
of time in it aswell, you are
obligated to get it done.

»CL2:In the article »CL3:Curt Cool» is pissed at
coders for never being ready in due
time for competitions but I feel the
need for approaching this problem from
another angle. A demo is a big project
and it involves more people than just
coders. Personally I was working under
extreme timepressure at »CL3:TP7» to finish
our demo »CL3:"Idoru"» after having finished
our 4k-intro and our 40k-intro but why
wasn't I ready before even attending
the party? It is often a timeconsuming
process to code effects because there
can (and usually will) appear
unforeseen problems, given it is a new
principle you are working on. (And not
one of the numerous we-only-changed-
the-colors-productions the scene is
bugged with at the moment.) Ok, my
effects were actually ready and the
preliminary linking was done but the
graphics I asked for 4-5 weeks before
were not! The fact that »CL3:Ib» (»CL3:Depth»'s
number one artworker) was constantly
disturbed by some fucking reporters
and a 3 hours powercut »CL3:(without
extending the deadlines - SUXX)» made
it virtually impossible to make the
demo as I wanted it to be. Well, we
were allowed to enter the compo but
for some time after I were considering
if I should release a final version.
 

»CL0:There is no doubt that the biggest
»PIC:Jud1.iff»                       amount of work
                       lies in the
                       hands of the
                       coder and they
                       are the ones
                       who make it all
                       come together -
                       I guess that's
                       why they
                       always have to
                       put up with all
                       the shit from
                       the other
                       performers but,
                       »CL1:Curt Cool», the
                       coders are not
                       always alone to
                       blame.
