Opening words:
This year again, the Wired team
invites you to experience another
Wired event. This fifth edition of
the Wired party will also be the last
one, but surely not the least one. Be
sure not to miss this great event.

As last year, competitions will be
held for the PC, Amiga and C64
platforms. On request, 3DFX demos
competition, and Windows
contributions will be organised this
year also, read more about it further.

WiRED is a special event. Not another
of those commercial event that likes
to call itself a party. The WiRED is
a real scene event with a real scene
spirit, all this combined with the
advantages of a quality organising.

Where and when?:

The Wired'98 will be held on the 17,
18 and 19 July 1998 in Wasmes (near
the city of Mons), Belgium at the
"Salle Polyvalente de Colfontaine"
(same place as the two latest
editions). The party place will open
on Friday 17 around 11h and will
close on Sunday 19 at around 17h.

Place:

   Salle Polyvalente de Colfontaine
          Avenue Schweitzer
       Wasmes (15KM from MONS)
               Belgium.

Check the section "How to get there"
later on this infofile for more info.

The main organizing staff

Van Audenhove FJ   (Darkness/Imphobia)
Van Miegroet Damien (Damien/Imphobia)
Loef Pascal         (PL/Imphobia)
Lamaire Benjamin    (BenJ/Imphobia)
Baligant Remy       (Katana/Pulpe)
Lecroart Vianney    (Ace/Melting Pot)
Baert Sebastien     (Karm/Melting Pot)
Lamaire Jeremy     (James/Melting Pot)

In addition to those, many people are
helping us out from time to time and
will be organising WiRED together
with us during party-time. 

It's important to note that we are
all scene members. This makes us able
to understand problems you may
encounter while attending YOUR Party.
Yeah, WiRED is YOUR Party! This is
why we ask you to feel free to
contact us if there is something you
want to tell/ask us. We will be
extremely glad to answer your
questions and receive your critics
about some of the choices we have
made in the party rules. We highly
recommand you to contact us if you
have any ideas and/or proposition who
could improve Wired in any ways.

What will it cost?

The entrance fee is 900 Bfr (±25US$).
This includes three days of party
with tables, electricity, etc..

As usual ALL of the money from the
entrance fee (after we remove our
costs) will be used as competitions
prizes.

Tradition says that girls should
enter for free at a party and we
won't break the tradition, would we?
So girls don't have to pay any
entrance fee. Now don't forget to
bring your girlfriend and sister to
Wired, ok?

Note that we do only accept payement
in Belgian Francs (Bfr.), so make
sure to change some money into
belgian currency before arriving at
the party place.

Wild demo competitions

Every group is free to contribute
with as many Demos, Raytrace, 64kb
intro, games, wild demo as they want
to. At least one member of the group
must be present at the party. As for
the solo competition (gfx, music, 4kb
intro, ansi), only one entry per
artist/musician/coder will be
accepted in each competition. Artist
OR a group member of the artist must
be present at the party. 
Entries must not have been released
before.
All entries must be delivred in time
for the deadline at the information
desk. This is very important if we
want to have enough time to process
every contribution.
All contribution disks must be marked
with the following information:

- Which Competition
- Title of the contribution
- Competitor Name/Group
- Boot Config (when needed).

The competition machine will be
rebooted between each demo and intro.
Contribution disks won't be returned.
The organisers have the rights to
cancel a competition if there isn't
enough competitors to make a
competition out of it.
For PC demos & intros, you can freely
use all modes supported by VESA 2.0.
This includes all standart vga modes,
all VESA 1.2 & 2.0 modes (which
includes Linear Frame Buffer modes).
Of course it's a "plus" if your
productions still support normal vga
modes.
If your demo, intro or 100k game
requires any interaction, we want ONE
people of the competing group in the
Control Room.
We know by our experience of demo
coders that the competition demos are
often not bugfixed for all hardwares
and sometimes run through batchfile.
Therefore, you will be allowed to
test your demos TWO TIMES on the
competition computer before we show
them to the audience. But please
don't come just before the deadline...
WARNING! Our video projector is only
able to handle resolutions up to
640x480x16M or 800x600x256! Using a
too high resolution won't damage it
but will produce a lower quality
output.
All the contributions will be
released at the party server after
the competitions.
The organizers reserve the right to
make change to the competitions rules
and to disqualify any entry which is
not suitable to take part into the
competition for any reasons.

picture quality).
Video tapes won't be returned (so
make a copy of it if you so wish).

Surprise competitions:

As usual some surprise competitions
will be held. 
This year again, our weaked brains
have thought about many great
surprise compos. 
But that would be stupid to tell you
about them now, wouldn't it? 

Voting system:

Everyone will get a personnal voting
disk at the entrance which will allow
safe computer voting.

We will make our best to release all
contributions on the party server
after each competitions, in order to
give the voters a way to view the
productions on their computer before
voting.

All the compos will be judged by a
public voting (100%).

Prizes money:

We, the organisers won't make any
money out of the party. Unless some
other so called parties which are
based on the money, we are organising
the WiRED party because we want to
make a quality _non commercial_ party
and want to keep a real scene spirit
in it. All the money left from the
entrances fee, after we remove our
costs, will be used for the
competitions prizes. As we can't say
exactly how many people will attend
the party we can't make an estimation
but considering the success of last
year Wired party and as many people
said they will attend this year, one
can guess it's gonna be much.

The prizes will be payed in CASH, but
additional hardware prizes might also
be ADDED to the prizes.

ALL PRIZES will be given during the
PRIZE CEREMONY at the end of the
party.

Some of the party features:

Really HUGE party area with place for
 1000+ attenders.
Large parking area with place for
 everyone.
Ultra High quality video projector.
HUGE Big Screen.
Impressive Audio System.
Party Network
Internet Access
Really awesome color party T-Shirt
 sold at a VERY cheap prize.
Free showers.
Separate sleeping room (outside the
 party hall).
Clean toilet.
Many great surprise competitions.
Disk-throwing & Coca-Cola drinking
 competitions.
Electricity for everyone.
Extremely cheap food support
We will enjoy the presence of at
 least one TV channel.
All Prizes will be given AT the party
 place during the PRIZE CEREMONY.
A real fun non-commercial scene
 spirit!
All this and a lot more...

If you want to show something
particular on the big screen (Video,
Demo, Wild demo or Game preview for
example), feel free to bring it with
you. WE ENCOURAGE YOU YOU TO DO SO.
The big screen is there to be used!

Catering:

You can easily find whatever suits
your need at Wired, you won't have
(like in some other parties) to bring
food from home if you don't want to
be bankrupt at the end of the party
:) Sandwishes and soft drinks will be
sold at the party place 24h/24h for a
very cheap prize (less than 1 US$ for
Sandwishes, softs)

We also have an arrangement with a
local "friture" which will sell
fries, hamburger and other junk food
next to the party place during the
whole event (24h/24h) at neat prizes.

Croissants and cafe will also be
available at the morning.

Wired 98 official party T-shirts:

In most of the respectable demo
parties, some Party T-Shirts are sold
to the visitors, but most of the time
those T-Shirts are undesigned, only
black and white and are sold for a
very huge prize considering what
they're worth of.

As last year, due to the success of
the Wired T-Shirts those last three
years, we decided not only to propose
you one T-shirt but TWO DIFFERENT
PARTY T-SHIRTS that will be available
for sale at the party place.

The WiRED 98 T-Shirts will feature:

HIGH quality graphics in FULL COLORS:
One T-Shirt designed by PL/IMPHOBIA
Another T-Shirt designed by
 BenJ/IMPHOBIA
A3 size for graphics (±40cm*30cm)
High Quality T-Shirts (Fruit of the
 Loom)
Very CHEAP selling prize: 300 Bfr
(less than 10 US$)
(cheaper than in any other parties)

Party network 
 
As usual, a party network, connected
to the internet will be set up
during  the party. 
Network specification:(new) 
Like last year, we will offer TCP/IP
connectivity to the party network. 
In order to successfully connect, you
need:   

a TCP/IP stack (ipv4)
a network card with UTP (RJ45)
connector (10base2 10megabit/sec)
Party Network Features:(new)  
DHCP IP & DNS assignation. (for those
without a DHCP client, you can
request an IP at the Network Info
Desk)
Local FTP, WWW, IRC & Quake server

Keep in mind that the success of the
Party Network depends on you and  how
much hardware you bring with you at
the party place. So please, bring as
much HUBs, Network cards or cables as
possible! We are currently trying to
make sure we can offer an Internet
access for any people connected to
the party network. 
If you have any questions about the
party network, don't hesitate to 
contact the network organisers:
