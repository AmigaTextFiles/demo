»CL0:You want access to the internet, but
cannot afford the subscription fee?
more and more ISP (Internet Service
Providers) offers you one month free
internet access either while buying a
modem or on some test & trial basis of
any kind. The clue here is to simply
accept one month of free internet
access from any national ISP, go to
netaddress.usa.net and get one free
e-mail address. follow the online
instructions to direct the mail from
your temporary e-mail address to the
one at usa.net; i.e
»CL1:"blind@passanger.usa.net."»
When your free access month is over,
you keep the usa.net address and
accept another one months free
internet access from another provider,
and direct the mail to the usa.net
address as you did earlier.

By doing this you will get at least
two or three months of free internet
access without paying a penny in
subscription fees (thus you still get
the telephone bill as usual).

This is a perfectly legal way of doing
things, but since i like to be on the
safe side when it comes to such
things, i am not responsible for your
actions and disclaims all knowledge of
your actions!
