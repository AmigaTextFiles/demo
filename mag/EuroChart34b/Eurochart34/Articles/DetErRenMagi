»CL4:        By Sixpack of Haujobb


»CL1:Introduction:
»CL0:Feel youself welcome to the hall of
fame series. Ghandy usally gives a
drink to his interviewing objects, but
I prefer just a nice sparkling smoke.
"Want one?" I say inviting. "No
thanks, I don't smoke (anymore).."
Magic hastly comments.


»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"Ok, let's start then.. Tell us all
about you! Name, age, groups, etc..."
»CL1:Magic: 
»CL4:"Well now my real name is Fulco Koop
and I choose my nickname 'Magic'
aprox. ten years ago. My age anno
domini 1998 is 22 and I am almost for
10 years involved with the Amiga and
it's scene. Before that I was a bit
active on the good old commodore 64 in
a nice group called Exotic. My current
group for almost three years now is
Nah-kolor which I founded, before that
I was a member of Xentrix, Cyanide,
Applause, Mirage, Trsi and lateron
also a short while in Dinx Projects."

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"Tell us more about your contribution
to the scene trough the last 8 years..
Parties, groups, mags you made/or was
helping to make etc etc.."
»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"The first party's I ever visited was
Prime'91 and '92, where even today I
am still in contact with the main
orginizers of these events. At
Prime'92 Animaters won the demo
compo.. The Party 3 was also a nice
experience.. I went there with Facet
and some other Lemon. guys.. As you
know Lemon. died at The Party 3. I
also visited The Party 4 and 5 ..
Somewhere In Holland 93 & 95 , Intel
Outside Party 1994. Also the Legend
Holland is Ok party 1993 was visted by
yours truely.. 

In my scene years I wrote for alot of
magazines.. My debut was in some
Magbox issue (which after that issue
renamed to Upstream) After this I
wrote for several magazines.. Thing,
Chit Chat, Rom, Upstream, Raw,
Generation, Buzz, No Sense, 42, The
Jungle, Eurocharts, Showtime, The
Charts, Seenpoint and some more... In
1992 I was writing for a Dutch only
diskmag called 'Jong, Snel & WIld' 

I was the main editor of THING (All
issues) and Chit Chat (issue 14&15)
and Showtime (issue4) .. I was
co-editor of RAW (issue 9) and
Upstream (issue 10, never released :(

For Nah-kolor I organized mOments , a
neat music disk with modules from two
of my best friends on the Amiga scene:
Dreamer & Muffler.."

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"How is Nah-kolor build up? Does
everyone know eachother? is the
communication in the group good?"

»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"The CORE members have a steady based
comminication network, while other
members are floating somewhat around.
Also some members do nothing anymore
but are still in the list for old
times sake"

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"Please tell us which future plans you
guys have. Demos, slides, mags etc..
Are you guys in the Pc scene aswell?
Productions in the Pc scene."


»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"We are preparing our first releases
on the PC platform. Yet I won't create
expectation here.. All I can say is
that atleast 3-4 demos will see the
light of day on Amiga in 1998.. Some
other releases aswell.. And on PC well
around april or mai our debut should
be made."

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"Will we see a diskmag from Nah-Kolor
soon? Tell us your plans for the
future.."

»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"Well Nah-kolor is releasing SPEED
packmag since 1995 already. Blaze/nAh
and Norman/And are making a polish
only magazine called BERET and Hiv/nAh
is main-editor of Orgasm magazine
which is evolving to be a scene only
magazine, this particulary magazine
has one of the most advanced code
ever!"

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"What is your opinion about diskmags
today? Who do you respect, and do you
not respect??? Any favorite mag that
you want to put some light over..??"

»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"I respect Generation, becoz I know
how less time the people involved have
these days to make it, and still
releases 3 issues per year. I respect
MOP, for all his huge articles at
3w:ROM. I respect Seenpoint for
joining Scoopex, and folllow in the
footsteps of RAW (like when they
joined Spaceballs :)) History reapeats
itself.. Than I respect all (new)
writers in the scene who aren't around
for years (like me) and are writing
quality articles with as purpose to
enhance the scene instead of writing
boring, not objective and gossip like
stuff.."
 
»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"You are only writing for mags who is
on-line. Why?"

»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"Infact I am not.. Yet the contact I
have with scene editors is only trough
e-mail and there mags are online..
Also because I know these particualr
guys for years now so it's a habit to
support them. Yet Seenpoint isnt
online neither is the EC and I am
writing for them both. Aswell as for
Retro and Generation"

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"Tell us about when you left the scene
for a while back in November 1996 What
made you do it? How was the comeback?
And why did you come back... (missed
the scene?????:))"

»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"Actually I just took a break.. After
doing showtime4 (best issue ever :)
and mOments musicdisk I was fed up
with it, and I had to work for SONY
music for a while together with my
brother.. After the break was over I
came back again.. Simple.. Yet I never
»PIC:Jud1.iff»                       stopped being
                       in contact with
                       e.g. Blaze/nah
                       and Metal
                       Designer/nah .
                       But I did with
                       Muffler/nAh who
                       when I came
                       back joined
                       Haujobb, so
                       this break had
                       it's sacrifice.
                       (I mean Muffler
                       left shortly
                       after he got
                       his own
                       musicdisk, is
                       this loyalty or
what? :) Luckily this all doesn't
matter anymore nowadays"
»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"When you came back, I saw many
articles about you.. Most of them was
not 'helping' your career.. If you
know what I mean.. Why all these
accusations.. If I'm not wrong,
Amongst others Shade, Sane and Radavi
wrote an article about you"

»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"I don't know why people behave like
this. My theory is that when somebody
gets alot of attention for whatever
reason e.g. because of his good work
in quantity and quality people tend to
attack them. Real life is full of this
GOSSIP articles in various magazines
about 'public' people.. Maybe it's
easier to fill up a magazine? Maybe
they are jealous? Maybe it's in their
nature to make fun this way? I don't
know. I dont care about it, well
untill the point when I could not join
in any good diskmag staff.. :D Anyway
the show must go on, I am still around
stronger as ever.. Read lotsa new
articles by me in e.g. Generation,
Retro, Eurocharts or Seenpoint this
year!"

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"What meaning/effect does internet
have on you? E.g. homepages, surfing,
irc, ftp, etc etc.. How much time do
you use every day on the internet?"

»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"Actually I wrote an article about the
effect of ONLINE scening on sceners..
(In Generation issue 26) Since I only
e-mail, IRC, surf at school I dont
have probs with it.. Yet there are
situations in the scene where sceners
become addicted to the net and get
isolated from there enviroment.."

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"Do you think internet helped the
scene alot? Or maybe not... Do you
think it divided the scene in two? Or
maybe you liked the scene more back in
the old days when everything was sent
by snail-mail?"

»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"There are lotsa positive as negative
remarks to come up with about this
topic. (Already wrote about it too in
Gen#26 :) Basicly internet is a
communication tool, enables groups and
sceners to communicate infavor of
organizing demos, diskmags etc etc..
There are no more distances! E-mail
every minute instead of snail-mailing
every week or so"

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"If you think back to the point you
took a break, you may remember that we
agreed about an interview for Jurassic
Pack. There were problems back then,
and an interview with you ended up in
Seenpoint.. Tell us a little about
this happening."

»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"It's more than 1.5 year ago
actually.. In anyway the interview in
Seenpoint was another one than the one
you e-mailed me that's for sure.
Infact Fishwave splitted the interview
up to make an article about me and one
about mOments musicdisk. I was going
to sell my A1200 which I bought from
Astro when he decited to quit the
scene and R.A.W."

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"Now tell us which demos you prefer..
(oldskool/todays 3d worlds)
design/music/gfx.. Which style you
love.. The best demo ever etc..."

»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"I prefer alot of (old) demos.. It
just depends on how you look at it..
Ofcourse people tend to say that older
demos were better, but newcommers will
say this in a couple of years of the
'3d demos' we have now... It depends
from which scene generation one comes,
and there taste.. The best demos ever
for me are Arte, Captured Dreams,
Tint, Substance, Wicked Sensation,
Odyssey, Hardwired, Enigma, Nexus7
some more :)"

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"Some weeks ago Ramjam got back the
rights to the Showtime name, while
Darkage would change the name of their
chartsmag. People said you would
manage the new Showtime under the
Ramjam label. Any comment?"

»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"On the IRC there was a hot discussion
going on at #amigascne about this
topic. Suddenly ACBS the old Ramjam
orginizer even joined the channel. He
asked me, and in a moment of exitement
I said yes. Some days later after
thinking about it I resigned. Because
of two reasons, I don't have time for
it the comming months, because the
summer starts and I wanna spend it on
the beach, holiday and some working.
And I think that Darkage chartsmag
should be the only one around in
Italy. (Sorry to all involved sceners,
but Showtime issue 4 will still be the
best issue ever :)"

»CL1:Sixpack:
»CL2:"oky.. Now you can greet to anyone you
like.. Is there something special you
want tell someone (us?) Will you stay
in the scene for a long time?"


»CL1:Magic:
»CL4:"I will 'monitor' the scene for a long
time to come, the question is how my
activity will evolve during my stay :)
I wanna greet all Nah-kolor's around
my matey's: Klod & Dreamer & Muffler &
Blaze & Metal Designer & Hedgehog &
Fame & Unreal Amiflash & Caro & Visual
& Protas & Qix & Norby & Qba & Case &
Traitor & Ripper All Polish scene, all
