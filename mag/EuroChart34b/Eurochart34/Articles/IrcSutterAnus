»CL0:                      I was just hanging around »CL1:#amigascne»
                     when suddenly something weird happened
                        - and as I'm not exactly used to
                        something weird happening in the
                       numberbased, safeguarded world of
                     cyberspace - but anyhow, the thing was
                      that some selfpronounced cool Polish
                      kids took over »CL1:#amigascne», I guess 
                      just for fun, using fake IP's and so
                                      on.

                      It wasn't funny though, at least not
                       for anyone else - but I guess that
                     wasn't their purpose, after all taking

                       beating »CL1:superman» - or not? Anyhow
                     »CL1:#amigascne» isn't the only channel they
                     have tried this cunning trick on, they
                     are also reported to have tried it at
                      some Polish channels called »CL1:#legnica»
                                  and »CL1:#polen.»
