»CL0:We have received a few announcements
about new scene music & sample CD's 
from the creme de la creme of the 
scene's best composers:

»CL4:News about the Fashion8 CD:»
Joakim Falk »CL1:(D-Luxe)» is now in
progress of finishing the details of
his songs, with that, and the soon
finished cover, we are going to have
it ready for you in a near future,
so stay tuned! 




»CL4:Regarding Sample CDs:»
The project has been on ice for a
little while, but will be taken up
again, as soon as the Fashion8 CD is
out. 
Additionally I (Gustaf Grefberg) am
planning to release a CD completely
on my own, after this one. I will
add more info about that when things
start to happen.
