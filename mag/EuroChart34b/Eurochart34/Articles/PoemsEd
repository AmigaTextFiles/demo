                     My my... This time we are so lucky to
                       have two contributors to our poems
                       section. As editor of the Coder's
                        Corner as well, I hope that this
                      doubling of poemwriters will have a
                     positive effect on the Coder's Corner
                      as well. Anyway, Skinner of Abigail
                          has sent us a poem, which we
                       publish together with Sido's lyric
                      thoughts. Enjoy this, and enjoy the
                         Summer as much as we do in the
                              Eurochart staff :-)
