»CL4:        By Magic of Nah-kolor

»CL1:Proloque
»CL0:Everybody must have heart about »CL1:Mop of
Essence» at some stage in his scene
life. For the scener's who have never
heard of him, he is the manager of the
diskbased Amiga Scene magazine »CL1:R.O.M.»
»CL1:Mop» certainly belongs to one of the
greatest editor's the scene has ever
known in my opinion. The last issue of
»CL1:R.O.M.» was released almost a year ago,
and than it became silent around Mop's
character. He changed his nick to
»CL1:Robomop» and continued »CL1:R.O.M.» on the
internet, adding a few articles and
news facts every now and than. Luckily
some weeks ago I met Mop on the
infamous »CL1:#amigascne» (even twice) and
we talked a bit. »CL1:"I haven't been on
IRC for months now"» Mop comments. »CL1:"I
am now using the IRC at my work, I
work as programmer for a local
company"»

»CL8:What's up with R.O.M. and Essence ?»
»CL0:Since it is almost a year ago since
the last issue of »CL1:R.O.M.» (issue 9) the
obvious question was:
       »CL1:"when will issue 10 come out?"»
Mop:   »CL1:"Issue 10 will be a surprise"»
Magic: »CL1:"And what is going on with
        Essence?"»
Mop:   »CL1:"Essence is working on some
        Intro"»
Magic: »CL1:"Do you still have an Amiga?"»
Mop:   »CL1:"Yes, infact I still see some
       demos every now and than.."»
Magic: »CL1:"What about diskmagazines?"»
Mop:   »CL1:"The last diskmag I read was
        Generation 26"»

So you see dear sceners, »CL1:Mop» hasn't
quitted, he still follows the scene
where he can. »CL1:"But life goes on" Mop»
commented on a certain stage in the
IRC chat session. »CL1:R.O.M.» issue 10 is
in the making as a special surprise,
while »CL1:3W:ROM» has some nice articles.
With guest-appearences by three old
mates of »CL1:Mop»; »CL1:Disney», »CL1:Macno» and
»CL1:Christine De La Queen».

»CL8:Essence is what remains when you
forget what you have learned?»

While »CL1:Essence» is on one of it's last
missions, it surely hasn't had it's
last breath of air. The Norwegian »CL1:Boo
of Spaceballs» commented that
»CL1:Touchstone of Essence» could be the man
behind the Amiga version of »CL1:Chromagic
2». The followup to the legendary »CL1:DCS»
musicdisk with modules by »CL1:Chromag», who
is now an »CL1:Essence» member. »CL1:Damion of
Artwork» even commented while
»CL1:Mekka/Symposium» was going on that
»CL1:Touchstone» is even working on a final
Amiga demo by him. While the Spanish
members are also trying to cook
something in their kitchen. If I
remember correctly even »CL1:Fishwave of
Scoopex» said something to me about a
»CL1:Scoopex/Essence» musicisk(?)

»CL8:Epiloque»
»CL1:Mop» was nominated and won as best
writer the »CL1:Generation scene awards»
trofee. »CL1:RokDaZone», main editor/writer
of »CL1:Generation» magazine wrote a
symbolic article to shape all »CL1:Mop»'s
deeds in 1997, but I am sure the
voters also voted on what »CL1:Mop» achieved
since August 1994, when the first
»CL1:R.O.M.» issue saw the light of day. His
(scene) 'life' work towards the Amiga
Scene community. I am quite sure we
will here from »CL1:Mop» in the future, and
for the real die hard fans who are
able to browse on the internet (maybe
some older scener's?) here is the
adress to »CL1:3W:ROM». Which got a new
design, and some new gadgets not so
long ago in the middle of June.
