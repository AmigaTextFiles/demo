»CL0:»CL1:Curt Cool:» of my group has been so
lovely to teach me something about
writing long and for some people even
interesting articles, just to fill up
an empty article-space in my mag - in
his own terms a 'filler'.
I must say, that I have a far better
idea than that.
In fact it is possible to make an
article regarding the art of writing
long and for some people even
interesting articles, just to fill up
an empty article-space in my mag - in
»CL1:Curt Cool:» 's terms a 'filler'.
All you have to do is to learn how to
use a text-editor (eg. NotePad® from
Windows® 95®, made by Bill® Gates®).
With this powerful tool in your hands,
you can use the 'Copy' and 'Paste'
functions, and quote yourself all the
time.
As an example, look in the top of this
article. I started writing about
writing long and for some people even
interesting articles, just to fill up
an empty article-space in my mag - in
»CL1:Curt Cool:» 's terms a 'filler'.
Later on, I simply quoted myself, once
more writing about writing long and
for some people even interesting
articles, just to fill up an empty
article-space in my mag - in his Curt
Cool's terms a 'filler'.
This shouldn't take too long, and
there's not a lot of work in it
either.
To make the result perfect, fill in a
lot of clipart, which can be quikly
made with eg. Paint® for Windows®95®
by Bill® Gates®. And there's your
well-looking, well-edited article.
Thank you.
