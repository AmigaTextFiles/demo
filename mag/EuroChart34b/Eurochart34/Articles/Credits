»CL0:Eurocharters this time are:

»CL1:Quedax» who made the code and was
verbally abused by his brother
»CL1:Nightsight» who lovingly handcrafted
the menu graphics.

»CL1:Curt Cool» who did absolutely nothing
except for counting all the votes,
formatting and texting the gallery
section, found new photographs and
snaps for the charts section, and
wrote quite a few articles in the
bargain.


»CL1:Cytron» who had some hard exams but
yet managed to format all the articles
and set the whole thing up, writing a
single article as well.

»CL1:Beast/Kangooroo» who was the man to
draw the incredible title picture.

»CL1:Magic/Nah-Kolor», »CL1:Sixpack/Gods»,
»CL1:Skinner/Abigail», »CL1:Kollaps/Instinct»,
»CL1:Optima/Depth», »CL1:SiDo/Depth» who were the
hard men to contribute with articles -
and »CL1:Shade/TRSI» and »CL1:Michael/Anathema»
who were the ones to answer our
psychologically abusive interviews.

»CL1:Kollaps/Instinct», .»CL1:judaS/ex. Capsule»
and »CL1:Cytron/Depth» who were the ones to
draw the clip-art - yes, »CL1:Cytron» DID
draw some of the clip-art (»CL8:sorry about
that -Cytron»), and you know what that
means? That means that we get too
little clip-art, so all ambitious
graphicians who would like to see some
of the work in the Eurochart - get
drawing!

»CL1:Apollon/Intens» did the first module in
a short while - and actually, we love
it!

»CL1:Mr. Young/Silicon» tracked module no.
2, another lovely track.

And the 3rd module was made by »CL1:Michael
"One2One"» of »CL1:Anathema» - and honestly,
we don't quite know how to praise this
module now, because we have used all
the right words - it's a nice tune,
yes...

But that aside, all of our voters are
our reason to keep on making this
wonderful chart, and that aside, we
need to credit a few of our trusty
supporters, namely:
»CL1:Blaze/Floppy&Nah-Kolor&Endzeit&
Appendix» (for a lot of votes),
»CL1:MadBart/Appendix&Teklords» (for a lot
of photographs), »CL1:Leunam/Network&
Haujobb» & »CL1:Nork/Network&Darkage» (for
some photographs and supportive 
words), »CL1:Punisher/Instinct&Darkage» (for
some votes), »CL1:Shade/TRSI» (for some
gallery pictures), »CL1:Lord/Kangooroo» (for
getting us the title picture) and of
course to everyone who sent us
photographs and snaps for the chart
section. Must say that the support has
been tremendous. »CL8:(Sorry, Ghandy -CTN)»
