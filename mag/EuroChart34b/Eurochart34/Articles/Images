»CL0:i had images going around in my head
of a girl with diamonds in her sockets
and she was chased down the hall

i don't know what to call it
perhaps i call it going wrong?

or was it images of myself desperately
trying to get into the sea before the
big bird catch me?

perhaps the girl was very happy?
perhaps i could catch her when i win
the fight with the big bird?

i don't kow what to call it
perhaps i call it going wrong?

could it be images of giant frogs
with various luminous colors
and a transparent big bird?

or could it be that girl with diamonds
in her sockets, and perhaps hiding in
a window cell?

i don't know what to call it
perhaps i call it going wrong?

she tried to go, but her
shoes kept her from walking.

i don't know what to call it
but i won't call it going wrong!
