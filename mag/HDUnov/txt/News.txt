    NEWS ABOUT AMIGA GAMES
=============================================

AURORA WORKS
-------------------------------
Aurora Works may not be a name that is well known in the 
Amiga market, however as those of you you have read previous
articles on them will know, they have some big plans for the Amiga.

Despite being around for quite a while they are still yet to 
release there first Amiga game, however, this will change soon
when their first title Hover Bomber ( look pictures ) hits the shops. 
This is nice looking game that is similar to the Bomberman series
of games in that your objective is to beat the other player(s) by 
laying bombs and blowing them up, however, the game builds 
upon this with features that bring it upto date.

Since my last report on the game things have changed quite 
a bit. The game will now, more then likely be GFX Card only.  This
is mainly due to the fact that AGA can't handle running the game 
in any screenmode higher then 320x240, this infact has been one
of the reasons why the game has missed its intended Setpember
release, too much work on trying to get the AGA version up to
scratch.The authors will probably consider releasing the AGA 
version as Freeware after commercial release of the GFX Card 
version.

Currently they are planning to have the game running in 3 
selectable screenmodes, 8-bit, 16-bit and 24-bit.  You will be able
to choose which one from a preferences screen at the start of the 
game.  I am told that the 8-bit version runs fine on an 030 & Zorro III 
GFX Card.  The preferences screen at the start will also allow you to 
alter other game settings such as audio settings (The game will utilize
AHI), network play settings (TCP, Modem etc.) and also the option 
to load news maps, sfx etc.

As regards to internet play, it will be possible but only when all
players are on fast connections that are relatively close to each 
other. This is because the game is very fast paced and requires a 
lot of data to be exchanged. The game is currently heading for a 
pre-christmas release on CD-ROM only.

As for Aurora Works other games, well they have a fair few 
planned but are reluctant to give any specific details on them.  
Zone 99 which was sceduled to be their first release has now 
been put back and will be released after the two strategy games
that they have planned.  Details are scarse on these but I'm told
one of them will be some sort of multiplayer space conquest 
title. One thing can tell you about them is that they will both have
internet support which will not be limited by speed problems like 
Hover-Bomber is. Both of these game will be AGA compatiable.

They also have a game called Betrayed set for a Christmas '98 
release.  This game will be PPC only.

So as I'm sure you can see the line-up from Aurora Works looks 
very exciting. I will try my hardest to get details on the other 
games they have planned but until then keep you eyes open for 
Hover-Bomber.

Diversia: New Screenshots
--------------------------------------------
New screenshots of the excellent looking Command & Conquer
clone Diversia have been released and are available on this program
for viewing. Diversia is Ablaze's second Amiga game, Strangers there
first game was released a couple of weeks ago by Vulcan Software. 
The screenshots on this page are taken from two different modes, 
Low-Res and Hi-Res, I'm sure you can tell between the two, the 
Hi-Res ones look brilliant.

As I have told you before, the game features 256 colour graphics 
and is viewable in a number of different screenmodes.  It will also 
be supporting Network play allowing players the fight eachother over
the Internet.

As I sure you can see the graphics in this game are quite excellent, 
they are extremally detailed colourful.  One part of them I particually 
like is the explosions, they look brilliant.

As for requirments, the game need at least an 030 with 4Mb Fast RAM.
It will also require at least a 4x speed CD-ROM drive.  The game will 
hopefully support PowerPC processors as already supports GFX boards.

The game is currently over 50% complete and there will be a demo 
for people to try out very soon.  For now take a look at these excellent
 screenshots.
