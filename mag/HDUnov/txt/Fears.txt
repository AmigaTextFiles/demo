Fears from BOMB Software
------------------------
You need the original game disks to install Fears. Just move
the FearsHD+ drawer to the partition you want the game to be
installed on. Start the installer and when the screen begins
to flash, insert disk 1 and press lmb.

The installer works with two different versions.  One should
be the original version which was sold in the UK. The other
one was sold in Germany under the Attic label.   It features
altered enemy sprites. You can only kill not human looking
aliens.

Thanks to Robert Karlsson for sending me the UK version.
Both require 2MB Chip and 512K Fast to run.
MegaTrained of course...it's a Gore Design.
