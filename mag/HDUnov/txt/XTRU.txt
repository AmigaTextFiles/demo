XTRU v1.4 (c)1997 Iain Hammond
XTreme Racing (XTR) (c) SILLTUNNA SOFTWARE LTD.
================================================
Welcome to XTreme Racing Util,
The reason for this little utility is because some versions of XTR
cant load track files crunched with the CrM2 format. Like us, a 
lot of people decrunch all the track,objects...etc files to be able
to play these, and some people probably did not even know 
about this problem at all.

This is where XTR Util comes in, it will convert all Track,Object,
Tiles,..etc. files from CrM2 to XPKZ and back again if need be. 
Also you can decrunch the files i.e. if you decrunch Misc/Car
Types you can edit the default values for all the cars. XTR will 
still load any of its game files if they happen to be decrunched, 
but please note that this utility cant crunch any file that you
decrunch at this time. Although it probally will in the updated version.  

XTR Util has only been tested on `XTR v1.0' and `XTR v1.1b 
`Aminet Upgrade'. It should be fine with newer versions, as we 
don`t think that they have the same trouble with the `CrM2' format
as the earlier ones do. The only other problem we can think of is 
track versions. At this time it has only been tested on Version 
2.11, 2.12, 3.00 & 3.01 tracks.

If you have newer versions and XTR Util cant load them please
do send them to us, so we can update XTRU of course only if 
the copyright allows though.

How to install XTRU
===================
XTRU has been developed for HD users and must be used 
from Workbench. We have written a install script, so for a 
easy life just click the icon.

It`s Installed, What now?
=========================
The first time you run XTRU you will be asked to take it into your
main XTR draw so it can find the needed files. Please note this 
is the main XTR draw where you see the files `FrontEnd' and 
`Race', although this is checked by XTRU just to make sure you 
get it right. Next XTRU will evaluate all tracks you have installed, 
if any are unplayable they are moved into the `Storage' directory. 

Once XTRU has been run, a window will open with a list view and
some gadgets. The list view is used to show info about the loaded
track file :          

Track name      : Name of loaded track
Pack Type     : Is it crunched? If so what type
Version       : Track version number(?)
Objects       : These two list objects
Extras      : used by the track
Tiles     : Tiles used by the track
BackGround    : Track background file
LayOut     : Track layout file
 World    : Track world file
Sound FX   : Track sounds

Any OBJECTS,TILES or BACKGROUND marked with a `*'
means these files are not installed, therefore you can`t play 
this track.

If LAYOUT or WORLD are marked with `**' this means these
files are missing but XTR will still let you play these tracks, as 
these images are only used whilst selecting what track to play 
on and not during the race itself. If WORLD is marked as `N/A' 
the track does not need this file anyway.

DEATHMATCH tracks do not use WORLD files.

Sound FX, as far as v2.11, v2.12, v3.00 track files are concerned
this is always `N/A' but v3.01 track show `Default.Sfx'. Maybe this
means that there will be external sound files!?

The gadgets :

Load  : Load a track and view info.
Unpack  : Unpack any XPKZ or CrM2 file.
Pack  : Not working (yet).
About  : About XTRU
Quit  : Exit XTRU
XPKZ > CrM2    : Convert Track and all Object,Tile,Background
CrM2 > XPKZ    : Same as above but converts to XPKZ format.
Auto Conv  : Set this to automatically convert tracks when
Set Laps     : As you know XTR will only let you play a max
XTR   : Start XTR game
Print & Save   : Print or Save the info displayed in the Listview.

XPKZ >< CrM2 conversion
=======================
When you install a new track(s) try and play on them, if XTR
complains then load up XTRU then
A) Check to make sure you have all objects,tiles...etc
B) If its `Pack Type' is CrM2 convert it to XPKZ and try again.
When you do convert the track it is changed and all the other
files are tested to see if they are packed then converted. When
we get a new track, we always convert it even if the track shows
XPKZ because sometimes you will get an odd Object or Tile that
is packed with CrM2. It only takes one and XTR will not let 
you play on this track.


AUTO CONVERT & INSTALL
======================
The `Auto Conv' gadget is used to set what conversion type
is to be used on tracks being installed. Instalation is very easy
just click on the `Install' gadget select the path where you find
the directorys:
Track/
Objects/
Tiles/
etc..

XTRU will install all tracks,objects and tiles etc.It will also 
convert them to whatever the `Auto Conv' gadget is set to 
(None,XPKZ,CrM2).Any tracks that are unplayable will moved
into the `Storage' draw. Also when new tracks are installed all 
tracks in the `Storage' draw are rechecked to see if they can be
made available for playing, if so they are installed ready for XTR
to use.

Set Laps
========
Press on this gadget and enter a number between 1 and 127
and press return! You can now race for 127 laps! Please note 
dont try an alter this on the XTR Setup Menu, It will let you 
decrease the laps but not increase them. Also while playing 
you will notice that the lap counter will become corrrupt, this
is ok, It just means YOU will have to keep count.

Using The Remote Install feature
================================
XTRU can be started as a `Default Tool' from a Project Icon. 
So people who make their own tracks can use XTRU as an 
installer for there tracks. When XTRU is started in remote mode
the only gadgets available are, AUTO CONV,INSTALL, ABOUT
& QUIT. See the Install section about these gadgets. This type of
install is the same as the normal install except XTRU will know 
where to find the track files. 

Once installed press QUIT and you will be given a choice to either
exit or enter XTRU. An icon is supplied for inclusion with third party
rack archives, this can be found in the ICONS draw.

Registration
============
If you send either Iain or Andy a disk in a Jiffy + return postage
we will send you your own personal keyfile, which will unlock the
advanced features in the updated version when it is released. 

Send bug reports and ideas (well anything really) to either :
