I finally gathered the newest updates of all the installers I've 
written for games from Ocean. Some of them have problems, 
but I wanted to release the pack now because I don't know if I'll
have the time to do it in the next month.

Keith Krellwitz now writes some installs. I included some in this 
package.

- Addams Family
- Dennis AGA (keith)
- Hook
- Jungle Strike AGA
- Jungle Strike ECS (by Tension) works???
- Jurassic Park AGA (beta)
- New Zealand Story (problems)
- Puzznic (problems)
- Sleepwalker AGA
- Toki (Keith/me)
- Terminator 2 non-arcade (Keith)

For most loaders, you'll need the JST program in your path.
You'll find it on my web site, aminet, or in this directory :) but it 
may not be up to date.

Thanx to Duchet for supporting the amiga PD & commercial stuff.
Enjoy and report me bugs.
