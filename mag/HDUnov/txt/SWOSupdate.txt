    27 SWOS updates 
    By Bush
===============================================
What the hell is this
-------------------------------
This Selection of updates is for use with SWOS 95/96, Euro 96
or 96/97 and any later versions of SWOS which use the same 
filetype.

Leagues Include: Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, France, 
Germany, Greece, Holland, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Russia,
Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, U.S.A, Argentina, 
Brazil, Colombia. Europe, Africa, N.America, S.America and Australia.
And the English leagues are correct to 13th september 1997!!!! 
 
I accept no responsibility for your computer blowing up or doing 
something stupid either directly or indirectly from using these files.
Also if you wanked on your computer when you saw how up to 
date the English leagues are this is also not my fault.

You can update these files if you like but promise me you use 
a decent editing program like SWOS ED by Piotr Bieniek.

SWOS is a trademark of sensible software or something like 
that. If you have any ideas or noticed any mistakes please tell me.
---------------------------------------- 
Installation
To Install: replace the files in your data draw of SWOS with lovely 
brand spanking new ones.

Floppy users: make a copy of disk 2 and delete a file in your data
draw that you think wont be missed eg team. 010 (estonia) to make 
room for these files. But you can find another file that will make room.
DONT`T TRY TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE DELETED LEAGUE
WHEN PLAYING (beleve me it`s not worth it)
