Short:        System update util, v2.2
Author:       Msi Software - msi@sn.no
Version:      2.2
Distribution: Freely Distributable FreeWare
============================================

For OS 2.0 and higher.
Compare versions of new files with installed files, and 
install new ones if needed.

Now you can easily update libraries/datatypes/devices etc.
DVC will copy the new file to the correct location by it self,
after asking you first if you want to Install, Update or Replace.
Everything in DVC is integrated, by this I mean...
No external programs or libraries needed (when used from CLI/Shell),
and uses the standard requester GUI, so download now ;-)

It has Pubscreen support so it can open on any screen,
like DirWork or Dopus. And when used from WB it can use 
the ASL Filerequester, AppIcon (Iconify) and AppMenu (Hide)
all three can make use of multiselection, and can also do this
while starting from WB (shift click icons).

Filelists can also be used, and DVC support "Internet 
file update", of all files in a DVC (Type 2) filelist.

This is currently a State-Of-The-Art Internet thing, and as 
far as I know DVC is the first program of this kind. And not
only that, it makes the Amiga, the first computer ever to 
do this. Some Internet programs for the Amiga (and other 
computers), let you download the latest version of that software
via the Internet. But this is the first time you can update ANY
files on your machine, from a filelist, via your browser, and it's
fully automatic. All you have to do is click on a Yes or No button.

DVC is freeware, freely distributable, and costs YOU nothing.
PC/Mac/Unix/Atari etc will have BIG trouble trying to do what 
DVC does, and the reason is simple, DVC is created with and 
for the Amiga.

You will also get the version.revision on ANY file, so DVC 
can also be used as a simple Version tool. DVC also 
remember the size/position of the ASL requester
as long as DVC is running, including the last used directory.

DVC also have a email notify requester that is available,
when a new version of a file is found. It will let you save a 
small file to Ram: that you later can email to a list maintainer.

New in DVC 2.2:
Added email notify requester and "$EML" support for Type 
1 & Type 2 lists. Added SYS:Classes/Codecs. IBrowse info
added to Guide. And some minor changes.
