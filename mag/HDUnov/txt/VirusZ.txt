      VirusZ-II version 1.39 ( 03.08 1997 )

Shareware
VirusZ is shareware which means you are allowed to distribute
it freely, but you have to pay a fee to the author if you use 
VirusZ regularly.  Not paying your  fee  is  both immoral and illegal.  
If you already have registered for any  former  releases, paying the
fee again is optional.  Suggested donation is  US  $15  (DM  20) 
or an equivalent amount in any other currency.  Please don't  
send  coins (they can't be exchanged) or foreign cheques/money 
orders as these cost me DM 15 (!!) and that's not worth it.

The fact that you paid your shareware fee doesn't mean that you 
are entitled to  receive  any  updates  or similar services from the 
author.  If you want that  kind  of  support,  you additionally have to
include a disk and enough money for postage.

Introduction

First thing to mention is that VirusZ can be used as background 
program that checks  memory  and inserted disks for viruses.  
For this topic as for every other  specific  or  global  function,  
VirusZ offers a quite huge amount of user-definable settings to 
configure it as you like best. Then you have the possibility to start
different check mechanisms for files, sectors, vectors and bootblocks.
This is what you usually do whenever you received new software 
from friends, PD-disks or from a BBS. Finally,  parts of VirusZ can be
controlled via ARexx and thus enables the user to interact with it from
programs like e.g. DirectoryOpus. VirusZ has been designed as a 
100% clean commodity without any system hacks, it follows the Style
Guide conventions and provides you with keyboard gadget activation, 
great Reqtools requesters and many other useful features. What  
VirusZ  does NOT offer is localization and font-sensitivity.  This has
one  major reason:  One main purpose of VirusZ is and will be the 
background facility. Supporting different fonts or languages increases
the disk and memory  usage  quite  a lot, and that would make it 
unusable for people with just 1 MB of free memory.
