@{b} POSSIBLE PROBLEMS@{ub}

Program runs on all AGA Amigas with 6Mb RAM ( I 
think 4Mb will also be enough ). You will also need
about 3Mb free space on your hard drive. Tested
on 020/28 and 030/50 with 4Mb RAM. See also
readme file on Aminet !

@{b}  HISTORY & AUTHOR@{ub}

Until number 42 (or sep97) this program was available only 
in Slovenia in Slovene language. It was collection of utility 
programs on one disk without any graphical interface. 
Number 1 was produced on 15.03 1996. Till 01.07 1997 
there was 41 disks. Number 42 or sep97 is first graphical 
HD Utilities program -- rather enhanced mode. We hope 
we will be able to produce one number of HD Utilities every 
month and upload it to Aminet. Please, send us your 
comments and wishes.
