           [The future, although gazing into our many crystal balls,
            is still unknown. Regardless of whether our prediction is
            based on crystals or science, those who try to predict it
            will inevitably fail.]

                "The next millennium? Who the fuck knows?
                 It's like the vikings realizing the
                 usefulness of Internet."
