[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]Process insights: FFP winning demo at GERP 24
Interview by Smaugur/ Nukleus


This interview was made very quickly right after the common breakfast on Sunday before everyone split up again after a weekend at GERP, January 2024. We got no chance to shake their hands because Five Finger Punch (FFP) was kind of busy holding trophies and luggage. But they lined up kindly to my talk.

Smaugur: 
Congratulations for taking first place in the Amiga demo compo!

Morbid/ (coder) FFP: 
Thanks!

Smaugur:
 Where did you get your inspiration from when you made the Planetary void demo?

Morbid/ (coder) FFP:
The inspiration just came in creative process, for example when the spaceship flies in over the moon crater Then I wanted a Star Wars monster (Exogorth) to eat up the space ship, and after that Corel wanted a glenz vector to combine this, so we made two glenz vector objects to came up from the hole.

Smaugur:
Whas it some more interesting things in the demo that you want to share?

Corel/ (graphican) FFP:
There is a part in the demo where the sentence: “They gone to plaid” came up and it is a joke from the movie Spaceballs. We also have the part in the demo when the astronaut tripped on the moon (which was Morbids idea by the way) the astronaut lay on the ground and then there accidentally came a sprite bug that we made as an effect to the demo. (There was a big applause when this part came during the GERP 2024 Amiga demo compo /vS comment).

Smaugur: 
I like this part in the end of the demo when the planet in the middle of the hand moved around and make the scroll text move with it.

Morbid/ (coder) FFP: 
That part that you mentioned was actually some complex mathematics to do so I needed some help with that code from Imodium/FFP.

<while we talk, the black hole from the demo is shown on big screen>, Coral is sharing and pointing at the screen: -This black hole (ring) for example we said, it would be much more interesting if it was not symmetric circle, and then the coder did this. Now its it’s a black hole with a bit inwards as you can see.

Smaugur:
Thanks for this quick interview. Oh by the way, I see here Corel that you got an old school Depeche Vinyl! I love Depeche mode!

Corel (graphican) FFP:
Yes, I got the Vinyl for 10 Swedish kroner at a flea market nearby at the culture center here in Skövde.

End of interview!

Post note
We also had the opportunity to take a photo of the hole FFP crew when they pose with two prices/pokals including a challenge price (1st Amiga demo oldskool compo + Other platform Demo compo) but this we keep in our hearts or ask Corel who has a copy of it :) Worth to mention is that Vilcans/FFP thought that the demo was finish in 2023, But they worked some more on the demo after that, so the demo didn’t look like that from the beginning.


FFP celebrate 10 years jubilee this year (2024), and Versus wants to congrats them of course.
