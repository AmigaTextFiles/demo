[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]AI editorial thoughts intro
by Browallia
--------

Would you like to write if AI is going to effect the scene/amiga scene and elaborate your thoughts?

This was my short introducin' question, align with the thought that its your perspective, not my own thats intresting.

When started this, I tried to contact kind of broad around editors from various diskmags through time. It was a positive response from multiple people, and I thought that maybe a small format (approx 15 sentences) was enough to write for each editor. It would been nice to have Estrup, mop (ROM), puh (oeopir risti) and Lord helmet (R.A.W) and RokDaZone (Generation) here too for intresting reflections and it sure looked promising first but no one is forced. Then I lost contact with kaosmaster (Showtime) and fishwave (Seenpoint) but I tried to reach you too. So, the ambition was high set, and part of the sand castle was blown away. In the moment of writing this, Im not sure if jazzcat (Taboo) will write about AI-topic, or something else. But enjoy thoughts from editorials representive from these diskmags Darkhawk (Eurochart), Judge Drokk (stolen data), Ghandy (Jurassic Pack), Zerox (D.I.S.C) and myself (Cows n Snakefights).
