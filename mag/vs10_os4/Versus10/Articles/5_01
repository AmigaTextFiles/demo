[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]AI survey among Amiga graphicians
by 11 graphicians


Eleven (11) graphcians were asked between Mid April to Mid May 2024 with focus on AI in art, and I got answer from all. There are other talent graphicians out there than these asked. The common thing among them, are that non of them is newbie in creating art in the scene. My aim was to select a mixture of graphicians (geographically, various groups, and in style). It might be a hint where the wind blows in replies. It may also be seen as a statement right now.

PARTICIPANTS
Archmage/Andromeda, Cheetah/Ephidrena, dan dee/Scarab, Facet/Lemon., farfar/FLEX^Loonies, Frost/Tulou, malmix/Nature, Prowler/Nectrarine, Razorback, Slayer/Ghostown and xeNusion/RNO

SURVEY QUESTIONS
1: Do you use/plan to use AI in your graphics or products?
2: Do you think AI-images should have own compo separated from "handcrafted" art in compos?
3: Are you worried that AI art will be fully accepted  in the scene?

Lets see their answers in order I got answers back (short form of questions used below for readiness). 

................................

Farfar:
-------

1: use/plan to use AI in your work?
I will use AI in assisting functions (to replace manual labour, like eg. Background removal or rotoscoping). I’ll also use AI for inspiration

2: AI-images separate compo?
I don’t think there is anything interesting in an AI generated compo, really. I don’t know why, but it just leaves me cold and uninterested. 

3: Worried AI art scene acceptance?
I’m not overly worried no.  

The thing about AI that I am most critical about, is that some people leave their own judgement and decisionmaking at the door. I think it does tend to make people stop reflecting for themselves, and just accept the AI’s output

Although maybe I do know why it leaves me cold.. like, when Made or Facet or Critikill create a piece of pixel art, they are setting a bar to strive for and learn from. With AI generated stuff, that just isnt the case. I feel inspired by talented craftsmen

Hm.. although.. thats also not entirely true. I do remember examples of ai pics that I found inspiring… but not often. I guess thr same could be said for lots of other inspiration sources :)

Facet:
------

1: use/plan to use AI in your work?
We all know, AI is here to stay. I see AI as an extra point of inspiration and exploration. Sometimes it helps to visualise ideas of course. It's great!! Using AI as pixel tool is ridiculous. I started pixeling because I like to place pixel. Outsourcing that to AI is of course something I never will do. And what do I then have to do with all the spare time? pff.... ;D

2: AI-images separate compo?
No different compo. Why? then we should have had many other comps like the 'copy' + 'no-copy' compo.. or the 'with dPaint' vs 'with Photoshop'.. 

3: Worried AI art scene acceptance?
I'm not woried at all. As long we stay critical and positive. I am more woried about the ones blaming and shaming others. Let them use that energy to build or create something for our great scene instead of jepardising it.

Razorback:

1: use/plan to use AI in your work?
No

2: AI-images separate compo?
No

3: Worried AI art scene acceptance?
No

Only time AI should be accepted is in some coding category where the coder self built the AI and trained it with own produced data. Else its damn more lame than a dmeo built with UnrealEngine.. Someone else has done most of the work already :)

................................

XeNusion:
---------

1: use/plan to use AI in your work? 
No 

2: AI-images separate compo?
Perhaps it will help abit but some people will use it anyway and fake steps for regular compos which is easy as hell. 

3: Worried AI art scene acceptance?
the whole "AI "remash scraped data thing contradicts every aspect of a diy scene.

................................

Prowler:
--------

1: use/plan to use AI in your work? 
No I am not using AI.

2: AI-images separate compo?
I don't have a strong opinion either way.

3: Worried AI art scene acceptance?
I am not worried about it personally. But I am sure it will be a lot of discussions about it.

................................

Slayer:
-------

1: use/plan to use AI in your work?
AI is an ongoing process and we really don't know what might happen. I try to see some advantages, but generally it fills me with pessimism and discouragement. The dynamic (aggressive?) development of AI in generating digital images caused me to move away from the graphic design a bit. Currently, I am developing my artistic interests more in the area of photography, which seems to me closer to people's emotions and experiences - which are (for now) less susceptible to the expansion of AI.

In photography, I use AI tools to help with some repetitive, boring processes to speed things up. I also started using Ai to generate concepts / inspiration that I use later - as references - to take real photos during a photo shoot with real clients. However, in both cases, these are just tools that are only an addition to my creative work as a photographer.

I can't find such a connection with AI in the demoscene and graphics design. What's creative about including AI- generated graphics in a demo? I can accept some kind of support for Ai in the demoscene, but I really don't know where to draw the line. Maybe I'll try a similar approach to the one I developed in photography, but I don't have a clear answer to your question.

2: AI-images separate compo?
Such a competition has already taken place (e.g. at Xenium 2023 in Poland). This idea seems fine to me as long as it is clearly stated in the rules. However, I have a problem with assessing such works reliably, knowing that sometimes they could have been created in 5 seconds - that is, shorter than they were shown on the big screen ;)

3: Worried AI art scene acceptance?
I have always associated the demoscene with creativity, not cutting corners. I don't know if we can figure out a way to use AI wisely in the demoscene. I'll have less fun watching demos if I have to constantly wonder what was created by   human and what by machine.

Archmage:
---------

1: use/plan to use AI in your work?
-No, never. I am confident in my own art and skills.

2: AI-images separate compo?
- Ideally yes, but it will not work in practice. The AI'ers are all over the place already, and some of them are not very eager to admit that they are leaching other people's work like that. 

3: Worried AI art scene acceptance?
- The C64 and Amiga pixel scene has gone to shit because of AI already, and is not interesting to me as an artist anymore. Most people don't care how an image is made as long as it has a WOW-factor, so in that sense AI is already accepted. We all know that several of the big guns in the scene use AI all the time, and with some exceptions they are not very open about it. It is only wrong if you get caught, right?

Malmix:

1: use/plan to use AI in your work?
I usually redraw stuff and yes, I have thought about using AI generated images as reference instead of images found through googling. But I haven’t got to it yet since I haven’t drawn much at all lately and I also grew tired of prompting pretty fast when I tried it. Some day I might try it again though.

2: AI-images separate compo?
No, no AI graphics compos please. Telling someone (or an AI) to draw something is far from the same as drawing it. There are some really active gfx guys out there, maybe we could have a compo where the same artist draws all images based on others people’s ideas and then we just give all credit to the idea guys? Does make about as much sense to me. And yes, I think the handcrafting is important in the demo scene.

3: Worried AI art scene acceptance?
No, I think there are worse things to worry about regarding AI. :)

Dan dee:
--------

1: use/plan to use AI in your work?
In fact, I do this from time to time. Nice inspirations and sometimes nice elements to use.

2: AI-images separate compo?
I think we should differentiate here and perhaps use more classic terms in the future, such as illustration and composition and perhaps a mixed form, instead of referring to the systems. There are certainly not many people sitting in front of Koala Paint and pixeling with the joystick anymore, but rather using modern systems and converting their works - but the competition is still called Old School.

3: Worried AI art scene acceptance?
There is almost a holy war of opinions that rages over the topic of AI (as, strangely enough, with almost all things in the computer world ;)). When the camera was invented, similar movements were seen. Press a button and the picture is ready? This is not art! ...and look what came of it. I see AI as a great opportunity and a means to get more out of myself and everything, even though my job is at risk. Clear. Now people who can't get a straight line on paper can keep up and even achieve better results. But hasn't it always been the case that competition stimulates business? To use the example above: the current camera models shoot at up to 60 FPS in full resolution and have eye tracking = in wildlife photography all you have to do is aim and press the shutter button and you have sharp images of every moment of the action. Where is the skill? And yet a professional will still take better pictures because he knows how the light should be and knows how to make the composition exciting. Well, AI will learn all this too and AI whisperers and prompt jockeys will know how to get their results.

Especially in the demo scene, where the appeal lies in getting the impossible out of old hardware and creating new things, we shouldn't fear AI, but rather see it as a challenge, right? In short: Yes, bring it on and show your best AI images in a separate contest, or how about a live prompt battle, analogous to the shade battle?mit einem Live-Prompt-Battle, analog zu den shader battles?

Frost:
------

1: use/plan to use AI in your work?
No. In opposite I  plan not to continue with digital art, because of how AI-generated shit already is used.

2: AI-images separate compo?
I believe that people who base things on AI-generated crap should be publicly shamed.

3: Worried AI art scene acceptance?

Well, many winning contributions in compos lately have been used much AI or heavily based on AI. Its not possible to be worried about something that already is there. What I am worried about, is that it its going to continue so the utilization of AI will increase, which seems to be the most likely scenario, if nothing concrete is done about the problem.

Cheetah:

1: use/plan to use AI in your work?
I am not planning to use AI in my graphics, but it doesn't mean I'm completely opposed to using AI in every field. I do use chatgpt for code sometimes (although I only code for my studies and not for the scene). As for my "products", I guess I'm not "productive" enough to call anything a product, and I'm not sure how I could use AI to get more productive. Please let me know! I have been threatened to be kicked out of my group for the past 20 years, and the only reason they haven't done it is that they forgot how to spell my handle properly! I desperately need to increase my output to stay in the group, or I fear they will replace me with a real artist.

2: AI-images separate compo?
I don't actually see the point of submitting AI-generated images directly in compos, but if people want to do that I wouldn't want it to be mixed with the regular graphics compo, so I guess it should be separate. 

3: Worried AI art scene acceptance?
I don't mind what people make as long as there's some recognition of what goes into the process. I guess I am a bit worried that people will not be able to distinguish what is made manually and what is generated. However, I am quite liberal when it comes to getting ideas and inspiration. It doesn't matter to me whether the idea for your picture came from a dream, a picture by another artist, or something AI generated. I think various AI applications could be valuable tools in a creative process.  I wouldn't mind using AI to get or develop design ideas, perhaps for designing a demo, or other applications, but if I see a picture I would like to understand roughly how it's made.
