[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]The twisted music article
by Romeo Knight and Britelite


PROLOGUE
Two persons in a galaxy far far away from the Amiga, but still connected to this Universe due multi-talented passions are Britelite and Romeo Knight, alias Peter and Eike. Peter is in a band called Putrid Defecation and Eike is playing in Drown in embers. We zoom out from protracker and calibrate to their guitars. 
But we want to do this with a twist: lets find out what they know/think of each other. 

intro-riff: about yourself first - what age how you got interested in music apart from the computer scene?

[ni]Eike (Romeo Knight):                    | Peter (Britelite):
[ni]Hard to be precise here but the real    | I got interested in hard rock and
[ni]fascination for music basically         | metal at around 6 years old, when
[ni]started around the age of 11 when I     | around 6 years old, when
[ni]discovered synth music for the first    | discovering the
[ni]time.                                   | likes of Iron Maiden,
[ni]                                        | AC/DC and Kiss
[ni]Also, the pop music charts back         |
[ni]then in the early 80s was heavily       |
[ni]infused with synth sounds which kept    |
[ni]me listening to this stuff. The         |
[ni]interest in guitar music came up way    |
[ni]later.                                  |

What's your favourite accord/riff/scale?

[ni]Eike:                                   | Peter:
[ni]I love playing sus2 chords on guitar,   | One of my all time favorite riffs
[ni]i's basically a power chord with the    | is probably the main riffs is
[ni]octave moved one full step up. In       | probably the mainriff in Orion by
[ni]regards to scales, I have no idea what  | Metallica.
[ni]these are called, but I often like      |
[ni]exotic scales that neglect all          |
[ni]diatonic rules and shapes, they can     |
[ni]sound really cool in context of metal   |
[ni]music. And too many awesome riffs       |
[ni]out there.

Your favourite guitar?

[ni]Eike:                                   | Peter:
[ni]Hahaha, since I'm a guitar collector    | I don't really have a favourite
[ni]also, all of them. :-) But to break     | guitar, but for example the Warlock
[ni]it down, the top 3 would be my          | guitars look awesome even if
[ni]Jackson Warrior US Custom Shop,         | extremely cheesy.
[ni]Skervesen Nebelung 6 and Ruf Doctor     |
[ni]Schroedinger 6.                         |

Ok, now lets twist the scales, Romeo Knight will talk about Britelite's band and vice versus.

[ni]Eike about Peter's "Putrid defecation"   | Peter about Eike's "Drown in embers"
[ni]                                        |

Describe the other's music with one sentence?

[ni]Heavy noise. :-)                        | Modern Progressive Metal would
[ni]                                        | probably be a suitable term.
            
Do you think he has as rolemothers or inspiration source?

[ni]Eike:                                   | Peter:
[ni]Certainly, probably the oldschool       | I think they're drawing inspiration
[ni]Death Metal bands like Cannibal         | from other bands close to their
[ni]Corpse, Morbid Angel or                 | genre, but can't really hear any
[ni]Deicide but also some noisier punk      | one bands influence in the sound.
[ni]stuff that follows no rules. He will    |
[ni]certainly be able to give a better      |
[ni]answer to this.                         |

Do you hear similarities with his scene involvement and his music?

[ni]Nope. :-)                                | Not really, other than using guitars
[ni]                                        | in some of his scene works.

Do you think his scene alias and the guitar man has dual personalities depending on stage, or same coat so to say?

[ni]No. Why would you need a dual           | Kind of, in a scene context I'd say
[ni]personality for making very different    | he gets to be in the spotlight while
[ni]kinds of music? The love for music in   | in a band context he's more of a
[ni]general is already enough.              | team player, working for the common
[ni]                                        | good of the band.

What music genre is popping up when hear his band name?

[ni]Eike on Putrid defecation:              | Peter on Drown in embers: Based
[ni]It sounds exactly as the name           | solely on the name I'd have guessed
[ni]suggests. :-)                           | it would be some kind of metalcore
[ni]                                        | or post-hardcore.

Who has the darkest soul?

[ni]Eike:                                   | Peter:
[ni]I'd suppose it's a close call but       | I don't think either of us have
[ni]then, he is a Finn.                     | particularly dark souls, Eike has
[ni]                                        | seemed like quite a positive guy when
[ni]                                        | I've met him.

Who of you would give a cookie to a stranger?

[ni]I have no idea what to answer.          | Both probably :)


Here a few song names from the other's band. Pick one you find coolest:

[ni]"Explosive Public Toilet Diarrhea"      | "Disrupt the Flow"
[ni]"Summoning the Waste Demon"             | "Infinity Declined - A Retrospective
[ni]"Rectal Fume Asphyxiation"              | of a Friend" "Cyclus"

[ni]Eike:                                   | Peter:
[ni]First one because it sounds the most    | Of those three I'd say Cyclus is my
[ni]fun. And I have definitely witnessed    | favorite.
[ni]this happen once                        |
[ni](not self-inflicted though!).           |


Describe the typical audience in front of his stage?

[ni]Drunk nordics.                          | I would guess Drown in Embers draws a
[ni]                                        | 20-to 30-something year old crowd,
[ni]                                        | with probably at least a few guitar
[ni]                                        | nerds in there :)


What do you think he would say to his crowd between two songs on stage?

[ni]"I shat my pants doing that last growl" | Maybe nothing, to keep up the
[ni]                                        | mystique of his guitar wizardry.

The manager of your band says:  "ok, include one of these lyrics line, else no contract."
Which do you grab, and which line do you recommend to his lyrics?

   1. "Three bloody mary - to me, John and Jerry!"
   2. "It feels like climbing a stair made of mudd"
   3. "The owl died with a final ho-hooo"
   4. "The cave smells rotten like a wing clipped Atari-falcon"

[ni]Eike:                                   | Peter:
[ni]I'd recommend all of the lines to       | I would probably go for number two,
[ni]Britelite, since it's impossible to     | and I'd guess
[ni]understand any of the vocals anyway.    | "the owl died with a final ho-hooo"
[ni]:-)

Which song do you like most from his band?

[ni]Eike on "Putrid Defecation":            | Peter on Drown in embers: I really
[ni]I hate to be honest here, but I'm not   | like the song Stockholm.
[ni]too fond of the music, basically        |
[ni]because this type of Metal is really    |
[ni]nothing I'd usually listen to at all.   |
[ni]It's a totally different approach to    |
[ni]a Metal band in general, also the       |
[ni]production sounds too unpleasant to     |
[ni]the ears (even though I know that's     |
[ni]on purpose). But I'm not here to diss   |
[ni]Peter's music, it's just not my cup of  |
[ni]tea and he's got much more fans and     |
[ni]followers than my band anyway, so       |
[ni]he's totally doing it right. But        |
[ni]music is 100% a matter of taste,        |
[ni]there's just no way to argue            |
[ni]around it.


Is it you or the other who spend most time in the merch area after a gig?

[ni]Eike:                                   | Peter:
[ni]No.                                     | Probably me :)

Tell three things that he should have in his music video to make it attractive?

[ni]Eike to Peter:                          | Peter to Eike:
[ni]AI-created piles of shit seem           | - Definitely some demo like visuals
[ni]appropiate. However, it definitely      | - Of course the band playing, but
[ni]needs to violate youtube's terms.       | not the typical djenting in a colored
[ni]                                        | room
[ni]                                        | - No long intro sequences

Who is sacrifying time with family and friends to hang out with his band most, Eike or Peter?

[ni]Eike:                                   | Peter:
[ni]How should I know?!                     | I would guess Eike, as it seems his
[ni]                                        | band has more live performances

Do you think his band would be more happy about a cover from Taylor Swift than you?

[ni]Definitely.                             | Both bands would probably be happy,
[ni]                                        | or at least suprised :)


Who is warming up with most booze during a concert?

[ni]Seriously? (Not me.)                    | Considering the required
[ni]                                         | technicality, I don't think Drown in
[ni]                                        | Embers warm up with booze at all.
[ni]                                         | While some of our members do enjoy a
[ni]                                        | few beers before a show, I myself
[ni]                                         | also like to keep things sober until
[ni]                                        | after the show.

Who has most underage groupies you think between your bands?

[ni]Eike:                                   | Peter:
[ni]I have no idea. We don't have female    | Neither, this is something better
[ni]groupies for sure but we had a few      | left in the 70's
[ni]teen kids being interested in our       |
[ni]music at our gigs, basically because    |
[ni]they were learning instruments and      |
[ni]could look up to us while ripping on    |
[ni]our instruments.                        |

Do you think the other guitarist is writing a lot of autographs?

[ni]Eike:                                   | Peter:
[ni]Peter does write?                        | At least a few, and probably more in
[ni]                                        | the role of Romeo Knight :)

Final question: what would you like to show him and his band related to your country?

[ni]Eike (Germany):                         | Peter (Finland):
[ni]We have the best public toilets here,   | Our midsummer festivities
[ni]with lots of malodorant diarrhea        |
[ni]spread over all surfaces.               |

                               Info about the bands

DROWN IN EMBERS (written by Eike):
I have been playing in a variety of bands and band projects as a guitarist and bass player throughout my career. I joined Drown In Embers only 2 years ago with the other members knowing each other for decades already. 

We're doing Death Metal / Metalcore with a bit of Prog vibes here and there - unusual chord progressions or uneven meters might just happen during songwriting, but also trying to always keep it heavy at the same time. We're trying not to stick to the steretype kind of patterns of metal music and find our own style. Playing live is first priority. Our vocalist Nicki puts a lot of effort into the lyrics, that way that they actually serve as a framework for concept albums. 

We're the classic set of 5 guys: Vocals, 2x guitar, bassist, drummer. We released the EP "Remembrances of the Argonaut" and just recently two new singles, "Cyclus" and "Stockholm" which were also completely self-produced.

PUTRID DEFACATION (written by Peter):
We play a style of death metal we call Toilet Slam, mainly as a reference to the toilet humour found in our song titles. The band started out as my solo project, but we currently have five members (and even includes another demoscener, Spiikki/Dekadence). We've been active since 2019 and have released a few EP's, some singles and a compilation album, with our debut album hopefully out before the end of this year. Previously we haven't played that many live gigs, maybe a few per year, but this year we've been more active on that front already playing a handful of gigs both in Finland and abroad (Estonia ja UK, with a festival gig in Germany coming up in late August).
