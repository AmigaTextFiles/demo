[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]Scamp part II - SceneCity, AI
by Lars "Ghandy" of Nukleus


Prologue:
SceneCity, seems to tighten the relations based on unique sceneID.
Versus found this intresting with developement and recruitment process of passionated developers. Ghandy/Nukleus wanted to be first out (not as developer though /ed), with morning plane, microphone and swimming suite over to a bungalow in Thailand.

In the "SceneCity: Developers wanted" thread (pouet: https://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=12643), Scamp listed subprojects with areas SceneCity chat, SceneCity TV (streaming), SceneCity VoD (video on demand like youtube's open source system). Apart from the SceneCity Social project (a new chat competitor in town?) this surely caught our eyes:

Demoscene history AI/LLM
The idea is to take an existing open source large language model, and fine-tune it on all historic information the demo scene has. Out of this we then would create a SceneCity chatbot that you can ask any question in regards of the demoscene and demos, and get hopefully correct answers.

But lets go back and see how this looks like.


Ghandy:
You and the team are also busy building the SceneCity website https://scenecity.site . What unique selling point will it have, apart from the fact that you are paying close attention to privacy in operation?

Scamp:
We think it sucks that the scene started to depend on commercial services to preserve its history. Because history has shown that commercial services come and go, and can turn evil. Oh, you used Slack for your groups internal discussions? Surprise, all your private conversations just got sold for AI training. You thought YouTube would be good to store demo captures? Oh, they re-compressed everything and it now looks like shit, and your demos now have ads.

The mission of SceneCity is to provide all essential services where the scene currently is on the wrong path of depending on commercial services. We are going to replace Discord, Twitch and YouTube once and forever.

G:
What other plans do you have for SceneCity?

S:
Next up will be the Video on Demand services that will have feature parity with YouTube, but preserve demo captures in their original quality.

G:
How did the name come about, especially as SceneCity has been a part of Bitfellas for years? Did you discuss the whole thing with Alien at the time?

S:
That was pure coincidence. I was looking for a name and available domains, and then came up with SceneCity. Of course I knew about Bitfellas, but had no idea they had this "SceneCity" section. I don't want to offend anyone, but from I see the last posting in that section is 25 years old now. So it did not have exactly high visibility :)

So no, did not talk to Alien. It was not my intention to "steal" that name or anything, nor to offend anyone. As said, pure coincidence when trying to find a name, not inspired by it.

G:
The topic of AI is developing at an incredibly fast pace and is hotly debated in the demo scene. Do you think that the companys (who are behind ChatGPT etc.) will soon be able to produce images that are indistinguishable from hand-pixelated images or self-tracked pieces of music, etc.? Do you feel threatened by this? How do you think this will develop and what impact will it have on the demoscene?

S:
Only people who stand still feel threatened by new developments. Stop becoming old and boring. Might AI kill us all? Might happen. But it's always better to DOMINATE new technologies instead of being controlled by them. And that's what we do. Zenta, a one-time demoparty the UC organizing team did, was the first party to have an AI compo. Actually "reverse AI".

The scene has to find ways to deal with AI. The current tendency to try to forbid and suppress it is stupid. AI won't go away. Deal with it, find ways to integrate it into the scene in a positive way.
