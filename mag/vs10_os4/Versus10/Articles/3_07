[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]Scamp on Breakpoint versus Underground conference
by Lars "Ghandy" of Nukleus


I don't think Simon Kissel aka Scamp really needs any introduction. He has been hyperactive in recent years when it comes to creating music and organising parties and companies.
Lets go into his mind on past, present and future.


G:
Looking back, how did you actually get into the scene back then, or who introduced you? It all started with a C64, as you told me. The Amiga was way too expensive for you to get started in your childhood or youth.

S:
Actually I have started programming as a kid on a used C16.

My first contact in the demoscene happened on the school yard. I had just gotten my hands on a C64. On the school yard I met an older "trader" that was leaving the scene. He gave me all of his disk boxes, which included hundreds of demos and intros.

I then to Como'94 with my dad. But due to social anxiety I was unable to stay there with so many people. Due to this my first demo party had then been Underground Conference 95, a satirical demo party that was meant as a one-time event by the group Purge. I loved it so much that I took over doing that party. More informations are available here: https://www.simon-kissel.de/simon_kissel_privat.html

G:
The Underground Conference (UC) is taking place for the last time this year, why is that? One explanation would be the sheer amount of work involved, especially as the party lasts many days and certainly requires extensive preparation.

S:
Actually in all my 29 years as a demoparty organizer I have learnt an important lesson: If you repeatedly do a party at the same location, no matter how great it is, for the organizers it will become a routine. And routine is what kills creativity and innovation. 

With the current UC location, back in 2019 we have found the pure paradise, something it is impossible to beat. Your own private gigantic party ground in nature, with your own private lake to swim and make competitions in.

But again, it has been becoming routine. Which it was clear for a while that UC13 this year has to be the last time at this location. Of course the work also is an aspect: There is no infrastructure at all at the location - no power, no water, no waste water canal, no building, nothing. We build everything from scratch every year, which takes a budget of over 20.000 Euros and days of work. That's the same budget Breakpoint had back then. The entrance fees do not cover this, so I am making a loss of 7.000 - 10.000 Euros every year.

We are not saying that UC is dead forever. But we won't return to this location. And me and my scene wife fashion are working on making an island in Thailand our second home. So it very well may happen that there is another Underground Conference in the future, but that likely would be on a different continent.

G:
Why should you come? What can visitors expect?

S:
Ask anyone that has been to a UC. It's a unique experience you will never forget, and you can't compare it to any event happening in the demoscene. No other party of this size is that packed with features and surprises. A lot of people are afraid of the "nature" part, but it's part of the fun to get over your anxiety and leave your comfort zone to party in nature.

G:
What do I think of when I think of a Watery Fastcompo, for example? I can still remember the Sea Compo mud contest at the Mekka Symposium, where participants voluntarily jumped into the muddy lake to be the first to retrieve objects, much to the amusement of the other visitors. Does this have anything to do with it?

S:
Not at all comparable. "Fun" compos in the past typically used to be very boring and simple. Like "drink this bottle of coke without throwing up". That's not what we do. We look at our environment/location, and think about "how can we make creative use of that". That's how we ended up with the "offroad live shader coding competition" where the challenge was to try code shaders that we transmitted live to our bigscreen, but while sitting in a wild offroad car doing a race, with the laptop to code on being strapped onto you so it does not fly away.

Or the "Seaworld Graphics" competition, where it's about painting a physical picture on a canvas strapped onto a boat, but with two other teams on boats doing the same, trying to kill the other's art using super soaker water pistols.

What we are doing here is taking the word "competition" to a next level: You can be best by painting the best picture. But you can also be the best by simply destroying the art of others.

UC has lots of these satirical competitions that may look silly on the first look, but actually have pretty interesting philosophical ideas behind them.

Also, we have a big focus on enabling physical art. For example the "Suez Canal" compo where it was about building your own toy boat that is able not to get stuck in a "suez canal" we had build. We had lots of creative entries to those.

So again: UC requires you to be open minded and get out of your comfort zone, but then it's an experience like you will never anywhere else.

For a quite a bunch of well-known sceners, UC had been their first party. Also it has shown that it has been a perfect way to open up to sister subcultures (more on this later). We brought new artists to the scene in the last couple of years.

Watery Fastcompo. Ah, that was the "Suez Canal" compo. And the timetable has been copied from last year. This time it will probably be something about "Huthis in the red sea", you want to be you want to be up to date thematically :)

G:
Was it difficult to find sponsors for the parties?

S:
UC does not want sponsors, it's strictly non-commercial. And no business would understand what we are doing, anyway.

I had very long and funny discussions with the financial authorities regarding this event and its costs, as I formally run it as a company event.

That was different in Breakpoint times. You may remember us having ATI sponsor those Helicopter rides, or inspiring NVidia to create their own demo party. We went to great length to make things interesting for the sponsors, to make them an active part of it while respecting our culture.

But again: UC does not have sponsors. I don't want to white-wash the event, it's just too crazy and out of the box.

G:
Would you like to share some anecdotes from Breakpoint or UC? That would be interesting.

S:
Partys that I organize always have been very wild and testing legal limits. In general I have a VERY bad memory. Basically everything that is longer ago than a couple of days becomes very muddy. I typically resort to other people to remind me of the past. So I don't have many anecdotes to report, ask someone else :)

However, parties that I organize always have been very wild and testing legal limits. I do remember when we told the (female) major of Bingen that we are creative people at Breakpoint and that she should come round for a visit. The moment she entered the hall a bunch of ... probably danish? ... sceners were on-stage, stripping naked. Pure coincidence. It wasn't a problem, I explained the backgrounds to this and our openness to everything, and the major was OK with that. And then there were those politicians trying to prevent and sabotage Breakpoint, and the fight we staged to dominate them. And the table tennis competition that suddenly got scheduled onto the days we wanted to build up the party, and the very very creative way we dealt with that problem.

In general Breakpoint was very, very wild back then. We did tons of things that today would be deemed impossible. There are tons of videos about it. I am especially proud about the opening ceremonies. Every year in the middle of the hard party build-up work a bunch of organizers went to crazy lengths to build and enable those last-minute on-site. Go watch the videos, that's better than my trying to explain it :)

What happens at UC mostly stays at UC. Breakpoint was wild, but UC is just another level. If you enable total freedom of creativity, and go to the limits of every crazy idea possible, of course strange things are bound to happen.

Right now when it comes to UC however what is in my and fellow organizer's mind is MBB, a very important core organizers and best friend of myself having died recently, leaving a huge hole in our hearts and the event. So UC13 will also about celebrating HIM one more time.


G:
Why did you decide to quit Breakpoint? Did you prefer to spend Easter at home with your family again, which would be perfectly understandable?

S:
It's the same reason listed above: We back then had very high standards compared to today's parties. You may remember all the crazy themed decorations, opening ceremonies, compo innovations etc., moving the scene to 16:9 for the primary reason of the height of the hall (you might remember the "actual size" meme). Tons of work. But it was the same location every time, so it became harder and harder to innovate. Also, back then we also made losses, and my
businesses were in trouble. I was really burned out.

Also, I had my shortcomings when it comes to leading people.

All in all, in the end the team decided it was time for a new start, which was Revision. Of course I never used Easter Weekend for anything else than the demoscene. In this case I helped Revision come to life by helping in the background and providing lots of financial support.


G:
You are the managing director of several companies in which various demosceners are active. What mutual influence do the companies have on the demoscene and the demoscene on the companies?

S:
I personally never made much of a difference between the scene, my companies and my private coding ventures. A lot of sceners have worked at my companies over the years. However, it has shown that when it was
time to part business-wise, it destroyed a lot of scene friendships. Therefore I have reduced this.

I also have always used my companies to finance, protect and shield the party events I organized. You know, if you do a public non-profit event, all kinds of bureaucrats and assholes will be fighting against you. On the other hand, as a business you can do much more without external interference. My events always run as a "closed company conference for invited professionals". Of course, this brings a certain amount of discussions with financial authorities as mentioned before. Especially with UC, our tax accounting can be surprising. "Why do you need a jumpy castle and boats for your event?!".

G:
Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years? Will you still be part of the scene? Or do we have to imagine such events in 20 years' time, where all the areas have to be accessible for the wheelchairs and walkers of 70-year-olds?

S:
During the last couple of years I have been heavily influenced by the techno scene. I have been to festivals, and have discovered that those contain lots of "hidden" nerds creating wonderful art. The techno
scene also helped me change my mind set and become a much better human, which any scener that knows me for long will agree to.

I find it a pity that the scene often talked about "outreach", but in my opinion into the wrong direction. We have sister sub cultures that we basically do not give a fuck about. There hardly is any interaction with the hacking scene, the techno scene, the maker scener etc.

With Underground Conference I have taken tons of elements from techno festivals - the physical art like laser installations, for example.

My future in the demo scene depends on how much that scene is willing to open up and keep innovating. I am not a retro guy, I don't want to talk about "the good old times". I will innovate until the day I die.

And this means whatever community out there consisting of nerds that are innovating I will call my home.

Also, let's see on how successful I will be building a Nerd platform in Thailand :)
