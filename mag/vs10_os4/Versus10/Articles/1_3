================

Versus is a piece of handcraft and should be seen as compiled piece of art by Nukleus and Void.

PLEASE respect the wish from the authors of Versus, which is their way to tell any readers that use an Amiga or Amiga emulator or any other platform created by the authors to show the charts or the articles. 

Versus #10 is planned to come out later on other platforms like online, but we still want to favor the people who love this format we provide, thanks.
