We use to have 12 categories, but this issue has 13 categories. Categories "Best musicdisk" and "Best Group" have been used every 3rd issue, and since presious issue, the 4096 Bytes (4k) is extended to category "4k (or less)". In this issue, we had to split the result category "best comeback/newcomer" into two categories because people placed bets either specific on sceners or simply groups. Just by adding these points would be wrong. Best comeback/newcomer and the for-fun category ("most important Amiga event") were overlooked by a vast majority of voters and the distriubtion of votes were kind of spread out. The rest of the categories were business as usual.... AMIGAAA!

To count votes are tricky, but over the issues it had been consequently and framework put out as an article: https://diskmags.nukleus.nu/2023/12/23/vs9how-we-deal-with-different-votes/
