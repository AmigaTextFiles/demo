[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]We love the sweet nostalgia of art 
by Critikill / S16 (SWEET16)


In a world characterized by the rapid advancement of technology, we feel like the guardians of a bygone era. Jade and me founded our little art crew in 2022 and called ourselves S16, affectionately known as SWEET16, and we are a group of retro artists dedicated to the magic of the old times, especially 16-bit times. 

Our passion lies in our youth and our first contact with creative expression. With new know-how and a deep connection to old Commodore and Atari systems such as the Amiga 500 and the Atari ST, we have dedicated ourselves to the challenge of constantly redefining the boundaries of these classic platforms. For us, it's more than just a hobby - it's a journey into the past, a journey full of emotion and nostalgia.

Pixel art may seem antiquated to some, but to us it is a timeless expression of creativity and innovation. Our works are not just simple images on a screen, but vivid reminders of a time when technology was in its infancy and the boundaries of imagination were constantly being pushed.

When you look at our works, you can hopefully feel the attention to detail that has gone into every pixel. Every pixel, every color, every line tells a story and pushes the boundaries of what is possible within the limitations of the old home computers. We don't see the limited resources of these old systems as an obstacle, but as an inspiration.

But for us, it's not just about the ideas and pixel art itself. It's also about the community we've all created and participate in – the Demoscene: a community of like-minded people who have come together to share their passion and inspire each other. Our meetings and Demoscene events are not just ordinary gatherings; they are vibrant celebrations of our shared love for an era that seems long gone, beaming us back to youth

In a world dominated by ever-changing trends and technologies, our work is a valuable legacy. It reminds us that innovation doesn't always mean changing everything, but also honoring the past and passing on its values and traditions. Because sometimes the greatest inspiration lies in the simple things –in a single pixel that brings a whole world to life. We may be overshadowed by modern technology, but our art is proof that true passion and creativity know no boundaries – neither temporal nor technical. And so we will continue to fly the flag of pixel art, keep the flame of nostalgia alive and preserve the sweet memory of times gone by.

Love. Peace. Demoscene.
