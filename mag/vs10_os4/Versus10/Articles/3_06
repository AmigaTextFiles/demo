[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]catch n congrats: deadguy
interview by Smaugur

Here I stumble right into the arms of deadguy, the trophy is still warm.
- Congratulations to the first place @ the REUNION party 2024 @ Kvidinge datacity!

Smaugur-Nukleus:
What was your inspiration to make this Demo?

deadguy-PACiF!C:
well.. saw some gif anims seven months ago on X/Twitter having two pong block competing. day before the party i had some thoughts what I should do while we are traveling by car from Gothenburg to Skåne - mostly because I know I would be alone in the backseat and remembered the gif anims. I challenged myself; could I during 24h code something similar for an Amiga Bootblock. So when Notorious^Struts picked me up I started to code on this thing.

Smaugur-Nukleus:
How did you set up the work to create this wonderful code?

deadguy-PACiF!C:
Step 1: find a comfy place in the backseat
Step 2: eat and by beer
Step 3: open laptop
Step 4: code!

Smaugur-Nukleus:
What would you say was the most challenging part in making Equilibrium? and why?

deadguy-PACiF!C:
Fit into a bootblock - I failed. Ended up with 1488 bytes

Smaugur-Nukleus
why deadguy, what does the handle mean to you and how did you come up with it?

deadguy-PACiF!C:
the story has actually two parts. before I changed my handle to deadguy I called myself dacount (reference to William Gibsons antagonist The Count). at one of the The Party (probably 1998?) I crashed (went to sleep) on my Amiga 1200. When I woke up my demoparty-table neighbours (which came from the netherlands) start calling me dead guy due to my ability to sleep on my amiga keyboard.

same day when I came back home from The Party, my childhood friend handed me one of his christmas gifts; the record Ministry - Filth pig, and one of their songs are named "Dead Guy". so I thought "well this fits me, lets change".

sure, I do understand it is repugnant, but I am as person are not.

Smaugur-Nukleus:
If you hade the time do you think you could make the code even smaller than it is?

deadguy-PACiF!C:
Add two more days of demoparty-coding? =D

Smaugur-Ñukleus:
Do you have any final message to the Amiga demoscene to add?

deadguy-PACiF!C:
Love you guys!. You define me!
