[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]GERP: master or underdog?
by Browallia/Nukleus

Gerp, Grep, white and green, 
over years releases seen.
From newskool to raster,
tell us are you the new master?

As the title reveal, GERP has turned out to polish the Amiga aura pretty well. Now we all go there or enjoy beeing part of great released stuff, almost like time machine back to the 90s. I will leave the title of this article for self reflection. It was fun to visit the party again, lets dig in.

SPIRIT OF GERP
Around 130 persons arrived in January 2024, probably a record with extended party hall for more seats. Approx 100 could have hardware/computers with. And right, there is some kind of unwritten rule to bring original hardware. No doubt, this is an Amiga dominated party growing over the years. From GERP and GREP to experimental green and white (summer/winter edition). But competing the space of Solskogen & Datastorm who were partying on the left overs from Assembly(?), GERP finally squezed into the spot in the early months according to Kardashian calender year.

GERP is a party growing from grass-roots. A strong scene core and enthusiasts from Traktor (mainly) but a touch of Nature and hang around-friends. Its the friendly side breathing at GERP, the private cousy atmosphere, away from a packed schedule with seminars that give us time to meet up and talk to each other. While other organizers search for getting attractive interactions, GERP is going opposite way, and we find the party, not opposite way around. 

Info and demo desk are there with home made signs on A4, ducktape, and projector that go lowres for Amiga resolution slides. I experienced the beamer while talking with Esau who asked me to convert the Versus-slide back to the roots. The party is selling beer, has breakfast included, and streaming service so its actually reaching out. If you go to GERP, you should know the dress code, if you go to bigger events, you are completly anonymous. 

THE MANDATORY PARTY REPORT
Cefa68000, Smaugur and me visited this time. It was good that the party was streaming, because we were major delayed due train business. During the train, I made a quick drawn picture just because I like to release if time. Im not that full of prestige, still I hinted in the title that it was made kind of quick. The graphic compo was a blast! At least rank 1-5 (see results) were really stunning art. Also nice with Archmage's entry, ending up 6th. 

Jumping back in time, when we arrived to party, first I saw was Wasp/Pacific who was in a small chill area, unhugged but not lonely. So he got at least one from me. Nice work with the GERP-trophies btw. From this small platform, it was in total control of who came in/out in the party area, good spot indeed. Crossing the tables towards the organizers, most people are indeed Amiga, but some c64 and some Atari can be spotted.

TABLE DANCE
We got nice seats close to old friends. For example I havent seen Bonkers/Tulou for many years to namedrop one. Sitting down next to Facet who beside his oldskool compo also for first time every competed with protracker module. Platon was sitting other side of the table and exxagon (friend of Photon/Scx) to our backs for some chats. Then Pacific to the right.. So what to say, we were surrounded by nice chaps , but I can assure you, no matter where you would take a seat, this impression would not be an illusion.

For the party, we also took some Versus paper votesheets with us. Too little time to distribute, but we got a good start encourage us to go on with the plan to relelase Versus #10 :)
- Has anyone seen tft? Sir garbagetruck shouted around. After a heavy metal look alike photo of us (for next Britelite's Putrid Defecation vinyl front cover maybe?) it came clear he wanted his towel for a picture. I had to ask about this, so here comes the explanation:


-* * * * * story of the towel, by Sir Garbagetruck * * * *-

I took the towel to Breakpoint 2003, my first party here in Europe
(Yes, after being in the scene in the states for 18 years...)

I took it to sleep under, because I needed to pack light,
as I didn't really have any space in my luggage other than a
week of clothes. So... I had it...

but Breakpoint was -30c and we could not sleep because it was
too cold, and we basically all sat under heat lamps. And, well...

I kinda tried to sleep behind TBL as they were making Magia (:
It was not... pleasant for them (:

Anyway, so, last day it warmed up and I just wore it, because,
well, I just had it.

So when I returned for 2004 I had to bring the towel.
And I've taken it to every party (:

-**************************************************************-


Ok, zoom back to GERP-story, where we were hunting pizza delivery man before compo starts at the parking lot in central Skövde.
- This is not only a party, this is an Amiga fiest, Smaugur said while grabbing another slice. And how true wasnt that. Eight intros and 9 demos what an Amiga show! It was weired though, that intro compo was shown after demo. I forgot to ask why. That night was kind of short due all entries and some delays (demo show around 21), but who cares and Esau was moderating the compos before he told us all to go home, show is over!

BREAKFAST AND GOSSIP
Breakfast was nice and think it was first time I met Erique/TBL sitting in a corner with spot/UP. Wonder if Erique started to get inspired for his side-project thanks to GERP (Numpties, debute intro at Revision)? I could feel spot was thrilled to do another Datastorm, time will tell. Truck was early bird and we split a table. Then talked a bit with Magic/NAH and talked about Versus. So when Facet/LMN arrived, he actually (fast as he can be) said that Facet could do the title picture for Versus. This was actually the plan to request for title picture. What I like with Facet is that he just said yes, but Im not sure he know to what :) . Great for anniversary issue and helped me out for one headache less. As a thank you, he got my written scene-novel "Purple" printed out for train back to Netherlands. Purple is included here aswell for everyone to read.

FINAL CHATS
Back at GERP, some talks with Malmix who kindly showed the left overs from breakfast table. Had a talk with crum/Desire who took his NES with him to party. I asked him how Desire could keep up withsuch many releases, he explained it to me
"we are like 45 persons, so its easy to get help. Sadly there is no syncronisation, so not all have contact with everyone in the group.....But help is there to ask if someone can do this or that..."

During prize cermony, it looked like Andromeda were not very satisfied for 2nd place (winner: Planetary Void/ Five finger punch). All three members (real party is in a hotel making demos?) came up to stage and shook hand with Morbid/FFP. After a fix of demo, Hyde/AOA managed some days later to fit 'a murder of scrolls' into 40kb, where it belongs. About FFP, Smaugur took the chance with a quickie aka interview right there where it was hot, read it elsewhere in this issue.

The train back while waiting, met codise and the finnish brigade. With him we talked about Assembly summer. Not sure his role in the party anymore, but I offered to shred some lights and vibes for the intention to make it good oldskool. Codise later whent to 68k inside.

And there it was end of this time. But question remains - GERP: master or underdog? Judge for yourself.
