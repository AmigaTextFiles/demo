[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]editorial thoughts: on AI
by Ghandy (Jurassic Pack)

In maximum 15 sentences, would you like to write if AI is going to effect the scene/amiga scene and elaborate your thoughts?

I don't think artificial intelligence will influence the Amiga scene any time soon. You would still notice it if it were used. Who knows for how long. Besides, the scene completely rejects such methods. If they were discovered, their own reputation would be completely ruined.

The solution is quite simple. At partys all AI-based works must be banned from the competitions. Anyone caught messing up must be disqualified in the long term.

Hopefully there will be more consensus on this than on the question of whether copying the works of others or using software from other computer platforms (for example Photoshop) is allowed or only painting like Amiga graphicians did it many years ago.

After all, there is nothing wrong against using artificial intelligence in scene related productions. It just has to be declared. Anyone who does not adhere to the rules must expect their work to be disqualified. Simple as that.
