[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]Essence of texts - time to sign off - browallia
================================================

Characters, is still the most powerful tool anno 2024 to say your message in the computer scene. Not by pictures. We do it when choosing that a demo title, the sample names in your protracker song, that snurkel-scroller or in that ascii collection.

The scene from the 1980s, now 40 years laters, characters forming words and sentences is the way for clearest messages. 

To state an opinion. To tell a perspective. To share your personal view.

GOOD BYE NR 2
Now its time for me to wave goodbye as the maineditor of yourbfavorite magazine. It has been more than nice, a pleasure to serve the scene with this. I know you are tired to hear it, but 2 decades doing Versus is putting traces. Already 5-6 years ago, I offered others to take over, but didnt get any takers. 

We may be too crazy. And only people in the writing soup business know the work done. For you, it may look like characters, gossip, opinions, and easily produced texts page up and page down. Well, scrollers are easy to write. But to pack it to a concept, something that you want to read, require a bit of effort.

We are competing with blogs, one-liner-trolls and a comment-based community. On avarage, a pouet thread consist of 5-10 people writing 1-3 sentences each. Out of that, you can never get a clear picture of discussing it to an end. Imagine if our newspaper would consist of communitybased one-liners. 
- Pure democracy you may argue. 
- Pure rubbish 9 out of 10 comments, and please try to sort out the noice I would say.

THERE IS NO SPOON - EVERONE IS A STONE?
I have been open with from beginning of Versus, that everyone's story is important. But to get people to write more than a 1-3 sentences in a community, it starts to smell like a task. And what we hate in our lives are tasks. When the days are over, you will remember the essence of texts, not the one-liners. Only one-liners you remember are from ancient past like big philosofers, poem writers or maybe from that movie...

People can write, everyone can write thats true. Because we all have the story to tell. Then, do you want to listen to someone else, is up to you, or just bring out your one-liners?

The teamwork with Void to do this has always been a pleasure and we have worked fantastic together. Thanks also to voters and sceners I have come across. We have served the scene, and the voters show non-ego acts by voting on others. Articles have been written and we have continued the legacy of holding this alive for Amiga.

We got +70 voters in the charts in this anniversary issue and multiple people (30, more?) contributing. Thats a lot, and we know it. I know that this issue you have in your scrolling hand was good, and I tried to hint-peak this in the seduce-tro Votebastards from Nukleus. I was sitting with royal straight poker hand... because of YOU. 
now its time to royal straight _flush_ away Versus 10....

IS IT YOU?
Now, before you ask yourself. No. Versus is not declared dead. I sign off as mained, thats all. We see how this goes. Maybe someone else want to take over this baby? Maybe someone wants to start a new diskmag? 

Maybe, someone is actually you?

                        Where you see sand here, imagine water.
