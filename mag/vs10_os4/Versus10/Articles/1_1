================================

Welcome, to the anniversary issue of Versus #10. After 20 years (2003-2024)
We are here. 
The journey when I started to plan this issue started in October 2023, so a long relationship is now over.

Many voices - many perspectives
In the year 1995, I stated, that demos will go up to sizes of a CD, 600 MB or more for the boring PC-scene, but not for the Amiga scene. Now between previous issue and current, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has popped out from soil (is this the rabbit whole or the butthole?). And proud to get such nice contributions here from honorable diskmag erimitus: D.I.S.C, Eurochart, Jurassic Pack, Stolen Data, Upstream, and Cows n Snakefights or how about article contributions from around 30-40 people, including a graphical survey with 11 graphician - such a diversity of voices. The anniversay issue also provides the magic number SEVENTY-PLUS (+70) votes that I believe impress everyone around in the Amiga scene these days for the chart part? Well, Im impressed because of YOU.

  "I love your spirit for the demo scene. I totally appreciate what you do." 
                                                                 /RokDaZone

Nice feedback soften us these days. Youth and forever young is replaced with that we will perish like a fading horse. The scene is about many voices and perspectives. Its NOT about the ones shouting loudest. In the diskmag scene, we just love to channelize thoughts through this medium. 

When I worked with collecting this, I was happy to have Versus team to bounce with. Crew behind Versus is the key for this realisation. For instance glad to brainstorm with jaribos (thats sobiraj backwordish, more known as Ghandy). Apart from Versus crew, one thank also fly out to curt cool/Depth^NAH for all patience with me. Im truelly grateful for your spirit, and reliability out of this league. If I ever create a module, I should dedicate it to you. 

  "The release of diskmags these days are always worth a thumb."
                                             Frost/Tulou^Triad

I welcome you to read, uh.. did I mention articles are around 50, PLUS 13 chart categories? We finally got that thumb out... diskmags for ever! /brow

Hi everyone, 

 The tenth issue of Versus is finally here!

As I'm writing this (om my cell), I'm currently enjoying holidays with family on Rhodes in Greece. For my Amiga-fix, I've brought the latest issue of Amiga Future to read. It is great there are still paper magazines being published, don't you think? The same goes for diskmags of course. Still, in 2024, we can dive into a world of thoughts, ideas, and feelings, so different from the fast-paced and ever changing world we live in, by running a program on an old computer first released in the 1980's. I think it is a welcome break from the insanely fast-flowing information online, where something is old news after an hour, and you forgot what you read yesterday. Diskmags are slow dining, slow living, embracing every minute of the experience - digital style. I for one love it.

As Browallia wrote in his editorial, it has been quite the journey since the first issue of Versus saw the light of day a long time ago. I'm happy to have had the opportunity to be part of the Versus team for many years now, and for the fact that Nukleus and Void still works together making it a reality. Now, here I'd like to salute Browallia for his brilliant work on planning, organizing, editing, and for tying all the knots together into this magazine. Well done mate! 
Also thanks to the whole Versus team for the hard work, you are the best!

Before I stop writing, here is a shout out to the AmigaOS 4 enthusiasts on Amigans.net. Hope you will enjoy the Amiga NG texts in this issue. Versus is still the only remaining magazine to run native on the platform, and we are proud to still be keeping it going. Thanks all! Amiga rulez!!
