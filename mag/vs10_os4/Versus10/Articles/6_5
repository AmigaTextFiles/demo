[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]a firstie's impressions
by saiibot/Nukleus


Well, I have now been to my first demo party: Reunion 24 in Kvidinge (Sweden). It was a very nice experience with a bunch of new releases to enjoy. The demo scene is quite new to me, so I had only some expectations which have now been confirmed positively.

I was particularly impressed by Fairlight's c64 demo as well as the nice song ”Petscii och Findus”, also by Fairlight. Also Blueberry's 128 byte(!) demo was cool as well as deadguy^PACiF!C's Pong-resembling contribution.

I also got help by some elites to set up an emulated Amiga on my computer, specifically Photon^Scoopex, who installed the system and gave me an introduction to coding Amiga demos and Blueberry^Loonies who fixed his own assembler editor AsmPro so that I have now been able to start learning the art of coding assembler code for Amiga. Now, I can keep working on this and maybe I have myself contributed to a release next time.

Reunion 24 was an amazing experience with cool music (from Fluke73) and nice people whom I look forward to meet again. I love the creativity the demo scene encourages along with the great atmosphere I enjoyed at the party.

Extra thanks to Jesper who fixed my Internet issue. A tip to everyone is that it's not a good idea to go to a LAN/demo party without network cable or WiFi!
