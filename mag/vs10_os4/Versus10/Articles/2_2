[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]The making of ChipChop #17
by Ghandy of Nukleus

What an effort! 72 chiptunes from 69 different musicians, that are the basic facts of issue 17 from the chippack ChipChop by Desire. This gigantic musicdisk has been recently released on Revision party. We asked Ramon B5 how he managed this extreme challenge.


How did you get the idea of releasing ChipChop once again? Who is responsible for that release?

Ramon B5:
As I recall, ChipChop emerged as a brainchild of us at DESiRE, born in the pixelated spring of March 1993 (tracing back to the debut of ChipChop #1). Back in the era where the internet was a distant dream and social media merely a fantasy, we envisioned a nexus of communication—a message box, if you will, intertwined with the rhythmic pulses of music. Our choice to embrace chiptunes was strategic, allowing us to weave together a tapestry of melodies and messages in a compact, byte-sized package. This concoction was our homage to the retro digital age, a sonic postcard from the past to the future. 
As time marched on, many in the DESiRE crew found themselves drawn away from the demoscene, lured by the siren calls of relationships, family life, and career ambitions. This shift put our creative endeavors on pause. However, in 2010, a significant move by our coder Sacha to the USA sparked a nostalgic impulse to craft one last demo for Breakpoint (the precursor to Revision). This project, intended as a singular venture, reignited our passion for our old hobby, drawing more enthusiasts into the dSr clan's fold.

This resurgence breathed life into ChipChop, leading to the release of its 15th issue in 2013, despite a gap in the sequence from the last release. ChipChop 16 made its debut in 2015 at Revision. We toyed with the idea for ChipChop 17 for some time, but the onset of the Covid pandemic sidelined our plans, shifting our focus to other DESiRE projects. However, with graphics from Lowlife long completed and a collection of compelling tunes at our disposal, we decided to push forward with ChipChop 17 for Revision 2024. Our goal was ambitious: to showcase as much diversity as possible by reuniting musicians from the early days, spotlighting emerging talents, and bridging the demoscene with the broader chiptune community. This endeavor led to an extraordinary collaboration of 69 musicians, offering a rich tapestry of chipmusic styles. Our skilled coder, Gigabates, miraculously compressed this auditory feast onto a single floppy disk, exemplifying the spirit of innovation that defines our collective journey.



How many musicians took part in this issue of ChipChop? Did you contact them all? This mus have been a huge work.

Ramon B5:
The response to our project took us by surprise, sweeping us away with its sheer volume and enthusiasm. ChipChop 17 ballooned into a colossal 168 minutes of chiptune ecstasy, boasting 72 tracks crafted by 69 incredible artists from both the demoscene and chiptune circles. As the project neared completion, we faced the very real concern of having to let down several contributors, doubting our ability to squeeze everything onto a single disk. Yet, in a display of sheer wizardry, Gigabates managed to pack every byte of music into the disk, leaving not a speck of space unused.

Organizing the project turned out to be a breeze, thanks to the plethora of modern communication methods at our disposal (and thankfully, no reliance on snail mail stamps back please). For many involved, the challenge wasn't in producing a hit chiptune for ChipChop but in crafting the accompanying scroll text and adding a bit of a personal note — a testament to the project's smooth sailing and the talent of its contributors.



I see this is issue 17, but I can only find 1-4 from the early 90s and then 16 and 17. What is the story behind that? 

Ramon B5:
Honestly, there wasn't a deep rationale behind the sudden leap to number 15. Reflecting on it, the jump to 15 was somewhat arbitrary, inspired by a quirky detail: at one point, we had gathered 14 mods and 1 ahx track, bringing our total song count to 15. This numerical coincidence led us to christen the pack with the number 15. From that moment on, we resumed our numbering in a straightforward manner, as if to reassure everyone that we indeed grasp the fundamentals of mathematics.



Any concrete plans for the future? ChipChop HD or DVD with 1.000 tunes? 

Ramon B5:
Right now, we're in the throes of the post-Revision blues, a familiar aftermath following such an electrifying demoscene gathering. However, the DESiRE team is never short on ambition or ideas, and rest assured, we're already concocting some top-secret plans that might just shake the world. We've got musicians lined up, ready to throw their support behind ChipChop 18, but ultimately, the project's continuation hinges on how well our efforts resonate with the audience and the appreciation for the time invested.

At Revision, alongside our ChipChop, there were some standout chiptune compilations, reminding us to pace ourselves to avoid oversaturation. Positive reactions and thumbs up on platforms like Pouet would signal that the appetite for chip music compilations remains strong. Such encouragement would undoubtedly fuel our motivation to dive into the next installment with renewed vigor.


However. Thank you very much for your time and energy!!
