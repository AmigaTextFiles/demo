Desire

Message from RamonB5 (27.05.2024): 2024 could be a record-breaking year for the DSR team in Amiga releases.

Elcrew: 
-------
16 years since last release (Pågadata 2023).

Ephidrena
---------
Frequent: has quit doing 4 channel music on Amiga now since many years ago. Reason is the stereo seperation on the paula chip. He has started to focus on other platforms though.

FiNitY (Finity Games)
---------------------
There are small details behind this group with so far a single artist aka Greippi. For example every second release is scene intro/demo (as FiNitY), so we guess that next prodution will be a game from Finity Games.

Ghostown
---------
Message from Slayer: We woke up from winter sleep. Two new coders (Spook and Kris) joined our team.

JazzCat - music, org
Slayer - graphics, org
Darklight - graphics

Haujobb
-------
Info from XXX:
We turned 30 this year. Haujobb was founded on 03.03.1994. 
So we will celebrate this at Evoke with a especially brewn beer by our subdivision "Braujobb".

Moods Plateau
-------------
Allthough Ghandy/Nukleus announced final issue (again) of Jurassic Pack, Selecta Novel/Mds is eager to continue. So expect JP #21 of this fossil. A wild guess would be around Evoke/Deadline but what do we know?

Nature
------
After meeting up with D vibe, pipe and malmix at GERP 2024, we know that 'somewhere over the rainbow the sky is blue'.

Nuance
------
Coorganizing party Comparade in November 2023 (https://www comparade.de). With paper votesheets the feeling is back-to-the-roots for sure. 

- Raven/Nuance is working on a slideshow with old and new pictures for the Amiga, most likely AGA.

Nukleus
-------
Saiibot joined Nukleus as a coder in May.

Buzz around the released vS#10 seducetro 'Votebastards':
A preliminary title of this intro was 'fear and voting in Las Vegas', but we must say, that we like "beer and voting in las Amigas" better (thanks curt cool).

Quadriga DemoGroup
------------------
The Irish Amiga demoscene group. Last demo released in 1993. next Demo to be released in 2020. we promise!" . Was this fake news, we wonder? cheers and welcome back to Amiga family!

Sweet 16 (S16)
--------------
Group founded in 2023 of graphicians doing artwork with 16 colors and love of 16 bit machines. Facet joined early January 2024. Multiplatform but Atari/Amiga are main target so far.

Looks promosing in the charts this time, and S16-train is loaded with graphicians. We simply suspect more coops with Haujobb and Lemon. in the future. Do not miss Critikills article in vS#10 (and in 2nd moon, issue #2!).

misc dishes on the chit-chat plate:

Dalton: next release for Elcrew or Tulou, thats the question or?

H7: I heard teo/Rebels used to be handsome
(dont start a flame war now! /staff comment)

Virgill: now also limeric expert, or? check out for yourself 

Es war einmal ein Mann aus Ibbenbüren,   
der wollte einmal spüren,               
wie das so ist,                          
wenn man seine Finger vermisst.          
Nun kann er nicht mehr im Kaffee rühren. 

english: 
It was a man from Ibbenbueren,
Who finally wanted to experience,
how it then is,
when you loose your finger.
Now, he can non more more stir his coffee.


...and with this poem, we close news around the globe for this time and brow has still not figured out if coffee comes with milk or sugar or both (or none, Kaffee Sumpf?).



   thanks for contributions keeping the news around the Globe section alive!
