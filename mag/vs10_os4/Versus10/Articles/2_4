[bkg=bg.pbm][h1]Temperature : ascii scene 30 left?
by Browallia
-----------------------------

ASCII sceners may be seen as outdated by some, but some of us just love it. It's really rare that ASCII artists get credit in an intro. The closest they come are the loading or exit log by pressing LMB (left mouse button). With that said, it's easy to conclude that ASCII artists are part of the community, but the role they play (i.e., being outside the credits in demos and intros) makes them a bit like outsiders.

So. lets. get. on.

THE FOLLOW-UP
I wrote an article in 2019 where I analyzed the ASCII/ANSI scene on Amiga, identifying around 40 active sceners. In this article, I revise this number, providing a decreased estimate of 30 active sceners. For this, I used my own research and our database, where we track nicknames and follow the ASCII/ANSI artists (nukleus.nu/vs). At this point, I should thank aSCIIaRENA (https://www.asciiarena.se/) for confirming the activity of people between 2020 and the beginning of 2024.

What I lack today is the clear connection that exists, but nobody really writes about it. What connection, you may wonder. The intimate relationship between the graffiti scene and ASCII. The mindset of the free spirit, the rough arrogance—an ASCII artist tends to have more attitude than a scener doing graphics, coding, or music, I believe. Remember the origin and the closeness to BBS-driven culture. Boards and the ASCII/ANSI society are more rooted than the average scener.

We started using ASCII in our productions in 1995. We had some great artists doing ASCII, and I was fascinated by the styles. If you ask me, every group should have an ASCII graphic artist; they are valuable, and it's easier to tame a horse than to explain in detail what you want out of the ASCII in a production. But as mentioned above, ASCII groups have formed on the periphery of the scene.

ACTIVITY
Another thing I wonder is why the feng shui—are collections or remarkable releases so rare these days? Goto80 has been very active recently with collections, but the productive "corona years" were really an exception. After ASCII Arena announced their comeback again (May 2021), there are mainly three larger sources for ASCII today (four if you count IRC): ASCII Arena (web and Discord channel), textmod.es, and the Facebook group "ANSI, ASCII Artists, and BBS Sysops Worldwide." You can, of course, browse into BBSes, and I hope they still get information faster than the web, but I think there is an overlap with productions seen on these three sources. Some may argue that textmod.es has also played out its role today.

Back to ASCII Arena again. Between the beginning of May this year and two months later, on the 8th of July 2024, the two top commenters have only commented on one entry each (Spot and Speed Devil), and there have been five comments in total (from 3899 to 3904). But on the positive side, many new users have arrived—33 new users, in fact (from 601 to 634). But are these new users active ASCII sceners? Well, I don't think so, to be honest. But then more interesting questions arise: when are you considered active, who decides you are active, and which forum determines your activity?

I came to the conclusion that between 2019 and now, 2024, the active ASCII scene on Amiga has decreased from around 40 to 30 sceners. Maybe I'm wrong.
