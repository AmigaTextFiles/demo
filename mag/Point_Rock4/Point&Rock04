@Node Edito "Editorial"

Heads up !
 
Yeah man !!! Here  is  the  fourth issue  of your favourite magazine.
I am happy, Point & Rock is well  spread  through  the World with the
help of Internet and IRC. I post every new edition on Aminet and some
friends of mine ( Lestat... ) give it where they can ! 

I begin to have some response from everywhere : a  belgian  guy wrote
me today  to contribute ( well  done  mate, I  will  use  your  cover
picture, some lyrics and of course your votes ). Good news for me, he
was pleased to read me ! It  seems  that  such  kind  of magazine was
missing so be sure that I'll keep my way !

I have also joined a new group on Amiga... It's a polish group called
Stage Diving Club, group  where  members  listen  only  to Hard Rock.
I would like to take the occasion to officialy thank them for joining
me. I hope  there  will  be  a good  cooperation  between us. Special
greets to my contacts in this group : Korball, Blaze and FlapJack.

In this issue, we  unfortunately  have  any  concert report. There is
no great shows around  here  for  the  moment, but  I count on you to
supply it to me ( I don't care if it was  on  the  other  side of the
planet :) ).

This month will see the birth of many new albums : we  are waiting of
Nine  Lives ( @{"Aerosmith" Link Aero_info} - see  the  test in  this  issue ), The More
Things Change ( Machine Head ), Remanufacture ( Fear Factory ) and so
on, so  stay  tuned  'till  the next  edition  for  more  information
( and maybe tests of these albums ).

It's also the second time that we have to  announce you a split. Last
issue it was Guns n' Roses, this time it's Sepultura !!! Read more in
our @{"article" Link article}.

That's it, I wish you a nice reading, keep on rocking man !

@{b}Sepultura A.D. -- The end of an era ???@{ub}

@{"Picture of Sepultura 1" Link Sys:Images/Sepultura_4.jpg/MAIN}
@{"Picture of Sepultura 2" Link Sys:Images/Sepultura2_4.jpg/MAIN}

Some  days  ago,  a  friend of mine told  me this terrible news : Max
Cavalera has decided to leave the band ! I couldn't  believe it until
I read in  the  press  that  it was  true. In a previous article in a
magazine, Max told that if a member  of  Sepultura  decided to leave,
band would @{b}NEVER@{ub} be the same. Some  weeks later, himself left for the
following reasons.

Will @{"Roots" Link Sys:Images/Roots_4.jpg/Main} be the last album of Sepultura with Max ???

You probably know that Max is married to Gloria Cavalera  and she was
until now the manager of Sepultura. For some reasons explained later,
Paulo Jr, Andreas Kisser and Igor Cavalera ( the three other  members
of the band ) decided to fire their manager. It  seems that they were
bored that Gloria managed more Max than the rest of the group. It was
always Max Cavalera on the magazines' covers...

Gloria  said in an interview : " The reasons ( P/A/I fired her ) were
cause the're jealous of Max   and because  of their  greed. They said
Max was becoming too famous, and myself was  becoming  too famous and
that my children were becoming famous too. They  also  got pissed off
when I quit  the  europeean  tour after my son  died. They never said
confort words when Dana died. That has left me schocked."

We have also read that Paulo, Igor and Andreas were complaining about
that Gloria was taking more money that she deserved.
The answer of Gloria : "Shortly after our last concert, on  December,
Andreas said said I was a great manager and  that he knew I never had
touched on any money that did not belong to me. But there's been lots
of insinuation, specially by I/P/A's wives."

On the other side, some say that there was a lot  of  tension  in the
band and that  could  explain  the  reason of the split. But the more
given reason is the replacement of Gloria.

In the future, Max said that he will continue a solo carrier ( and he
will be managed by  Oasis  Management, which is... Gloria Cavalera ).
He would like to work with his brother Igor, but  he  doesn't want to
hear about Paulo and Andreas. Max is planning  to  continue to create
weird and strong music as he was doing in Sepultura and even more !!!
He feels now free to compose what he want.

The three other members will  continue  their  work under the name of
Sepultura. The new vocalist of the band will be Andreas and they keep
their Roadrunner Label.

So, that's it ! It seems that divorce is complete. It's  a shame that
this happened because, in  my humble opinion, Sepultura was rising to
a great destiny. I wait now more informations about that subject.

If you want  to  learn  more  about  that, I suggest you to visit the
following internet site ( where I get  the stuff for this article ) :

@Node Downset "Downset : 1 out of 3 women will be raped in her lifetime"

@{b}"1 out of 3 women will be raped in her lifetime.
  
                                    STOP SEXUAL VIOLENCE NOW !!"@{ub}


That's  what  you  can read when you open the CD box and when you put
off the donwset CD of  its place. This time, no more noisy pop-music,
now it's time to rise your fist and to protest......

Donwset is, as the name doesn't tell it, a fusion group. When you put
one of these CD's  in your  cd-player, you  can  feel the temperature
rising and  the atmosphere  becoming more  and more palpable. L.A. is
near, you  can  hear  the  sirens  screaming  all through the Central
Banking  District  and  suddenly  it  starts,  the  cool  speedy  and
aggressive lyrics of Ray takes control of your brain, and at the same
time, a really cool music strikes your ears. The anger is growing and
this time for a good reason....

The first  album  seems  to  be in the same style than the well known
Rage Against The Machine but in a more aggressive form and style. The
second one explores more different styles of music, always fusion but
punk too.

The  coolest tracks ( there are nothing bad on  these two albums, the
whole thing is delicious ) are "ANGER", "RITUAL", "BREED THE KILLER",
"SICKNESS", "AGAINST THE SPIRITS", "ENPOWER", and in the intro on the
second CD, you can hear M. Luther  King during a speech, during "THE"
speech about the well world-wide-known :


                         "I have a dream"

simply cool.

As  always  in  the  fusion style, the U.S. system explodes under the
hits of the lyrics, and bullets of sound.... tasty !!

The members of this pack are for the 1st album ( simply "Downset" ) :

                   -Ray Anthony Oropeza as singer
                   -Rogelio Lozano as guitar
                   -James Morris as bass
                   -Chris lee as drums
                   -Ares as guitar

                    
and for  the  second album ( "Do We Speak A Dead Language" ) the band
is now :
                    
                   -Ray Anthony Oropeza always as singer
                   -James Morris still on the bass
                   -Chris lee hits his drums like ever
                   -Ares shoot you down one more time with his guitar

Rogelio Lozano seems to have left the band for an unknown reason.

If  you've  got the second CD, you cand find a so called secret track
at  the  end  of  this one. This track  is dedicated to the memory of 
Aaron Seth Anderson.

DOWNSET  is  a  highly  anti-sexism, anti-U.S.A. system, anti-racism, 
anti-Milli Vanilly ( Ha Ha ! You need to buy the CD  to  hear this. I
give you an indication : listen  carefully  to  the 4th  track of the
band's first album ).

I hope that you have liked this ( short ) article, maybe another  one
from me soon, with the same bad english...


                             see ya all,
                             support "Point & Rock",
                             and don't forget;
                            
                     None are more hopelessly enslaved, 
                than those who falsely believe they are free.
                            
                                              J.W. VAN GOETHE

@Node use "How to use it?"

Very  easy : you just have to point your mouse on each item you  want
to  read. The program will go to the part of the  mag  that interests
you. 
For the @{"vote form" Link Vote}, select print in the project menu and connect your
printer !!!

I have built  the mag while thinking that each time an information is
available  about a  band ( news, concert or anything else ), the name
would be highlighted. So each  time you  see a  button containing the
name of the band, a simple click will  give  you everything available
about it !

# Final Words #

@Node Final "Final Words"

For the fourth time, I  must  tell  you : the  show is over ! But the
show will go on !!! I'll be back in ± 2  months  with  a new issue of
YOUR favourite magazine !

I have already  some ideas  for  next  edition, but shuuut !!! It's a
secret !!! I hope that what I want to do will be possible.

I  need  more  contribution  for  the  votes. Note to all voters : be
REGULAR ! When you  see  the  new edition has hit the street, fill in
another vote form. You  can  send  it  to me by snail or by E-mail...
I thanx here Nec and Dieter for their stuff ! I appreciated it.

Summer is approaching, and  also  the  long  awaited  festivals. This
year, a lot of bands will tour in Europe. I think to Aerosmith, Kiss,
Smashing Pumpkins... If you go to one of these festivals, think to me
and write an article ( I'll do it too :) ).

I hope next time I won't  have  to  announce  another split. It's the
second time that I have to. Maybe next time I will  tell you that YAB
( Yet Another Band ) is reforming...

That's it for today, I have nothing more to say, keep on rocking men,
and women !!! Enjoy life and music.

See you in Point & Rock 5.

And don't forget : Same old every day, if things don't  change you're
just gonna rot !!! ( Aerosmith - Get a Grip )



                                Yours, 
                                Mister No ^ aßS - 20/03/97

@Node Albums "Albums to listen"

@{b}Albums to listen@{ub}

This time, we have 4 albums in tests, a record !!! We'll give you our
opinion on the following albums :

@{"Aerosmith" Link Aerosmith} : Nine Lives
@{"Tool" Link Tool} : Aenima
@{"Marylin Manson" Link Manson} : Smells Like Children
@{"Uncle Meat" Link Meat} : Swallow

We have decided to change our quotation system. You will  now have to
deal  with   stars.  Signification   is  just  like  in  the  belgian
universities :

- [*][*][*][*][*] = Very high distinction
- [*][*][*][*][ ] = High distinction
- [*][*][*][ ][ ] = Distinction
- [*][*][ ][ ][ ] = Satisfaction
- [*][ ][ ][ ][ ] = Insufficient
- [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ] = Exclusion mark

@endnode

@Node Tool "Tool : Aenima"

@{b}Tool : Aenima@{ub}

Yes, I know this album is not recent ( and also  other albums in test
here ), but I heard in different places that Aenima was  a good piece
of work. I finaly decided to  buy  it and put my hear on these songs.

First  of  all, the  cover  is  beautiful. There  is a great artistic
research, as the music itself. Imagine numbers on  eyes following you
when you incline the CD box... Effect guaranteed !!!

But the music ??? The  first  time  you  listen  this  album, you are
shocked by  the  power  of  the composition, even if the tempo is low
sometimes. You  could  also  be  deranged  by  some strange songs ( I
recommend you "(-) Ions" ), but  as  I already told you, this is very
artistic. There is  even  a  song in German ( "Die Eier von Satan" ).
During more than 77 minutes, you will  be attacked by loud and strong
guitars and other strange instruments.

The singer sings his lyrics in  a very  melodic way. Just a shadow in
this painting, no  lyrics  are printed  on  the  cover. I  am  always
frustrated when this  happens because I can't sing the songs... Maybe
I  will  find  it on Internet ( and give it to you in a near issue ).
The singer can give some dark atmosphere at the songs, it's great.

If you  like  to discover new things, you certainly can give a chance
to this album.

My quotation : [*][*][*][*][*]

@endnode

@node Aerosmith "Aerosmith : Nine Lives"

@{b}Aerosmith : Nine Lives@{ub}

Aerosmith  is  finaly  back with their new album called "Nine Lives".
The last album was in 1993, it's quite long !

So,  how  is  it,  will  you  ask ??? I  will answer good ( if not, I
wouldn't wrote down those lines... only  good  albums  are  tested in
Point & Rock ).

Everything begins with some cats crying in your hear and "Nine Lives"
is launched. It's a great song to begin the album.

Just like Get A Grip, we  can  recognize the "Aerosmith touch". There
is  for  every  taste :  strong  songs  like  "Nine  Lives", "Crash",
"Something's Gotta Give", "Falling In Love" ( I  especialy  like  the
bass guitar on this song )... but  also  songs  that  will make girls
cry : "Fallen Angels", "Hole In My Soul",...

No  indications  about  that  but  I suspect Joe Perry to sing on one
song : put an hear on "Falling Off", you will hear  that it's another
singer or that Steven Tyler can change his voice...

There is a note of exoticism with "Taste Of India" with indian sounds
in  the  debut.  This  song  must   have  influenced  the  graphician
responsible of the cover picture ( an indian catwoman dancing amongst
serpents ).

The packaging is absolutely fabulous : on  each  page of the booklet,
there is a picture which  is  part  of the  next picture and so on...
Just one thing, NO  LYRICS  printed !!!  Grrrr... I  hate it, another
thing to search on internet ( but  I  should  be  glad,  it's another
thing to put on the mag :) ).

So, if you're a fan of Aerosmith, you can surely go and buy this CD !

My quotation : [*][*][*][*][*]

@endnode

@Node Manson "Marylin Manson : Smells Like Children"

@{b}Marylin Manson : Smells like children@{ub}

You can tell me this album was out last year, I've  listen to it some
days ago only ! Hey, nobody's perfect...

So, I was thinking that sometimes I was listening to strange piece of
music, but  this  album  swept all my thoughts !!! I have never heard
such a debauchery of crazy songs. Madness is here, it's sure.

During all the album, you can  feel  a huge unhealthy atmosphere. You
can be  sometimes  deranged by some sick passages ( just like in "May
Cause Discoloration Of Urine Or Feces" or "F*** Frankie" --- even the
titles are crazies !!! ).

But the music  is strong and  you are surprised to continue to listen
this album, just maybe to discover until where the  sir Manson can go
in his madness.

A big  surprise is the reprise of "Sweet Dreams ( are made of this )"
of Eurythmics. If  you have not seen the video clip already, you MUST
see it ! You'll see how  much this group is sick ( for our joy I must
say ). Sometimes  I  wonder  myself  if  Marylin Manson is not @{u}REALLY@{uu}
crazy !!!

It's certainly an album to listen 1 time in your life !!!

My Quotation [*][*][*][*][ ]

@endnode

@Node Meat "Uncle Meat : Swallow"

@{b}Uncle Meat : Swallow@{ub}

Internet has something good in the  fact  that  you can meet some new
friends. And sometimes, those friends are  playing in a group of Hard
Rock. That's what happened to me some weeks ago. Lestat introduced me
to a guy who was  loving  my  humble  work ( this  mag ! ). This guy,
named Afreak on IRC is  the  drummer  in a belgian band called "Uncle
Meat".

He  told  me  that  their  new  album  was out ( "Underneat" ). I was
searching for this album  and I have not found it yet. But, a CD shop
was closing  his  doors and  cutting prices with 80% off. I thought :
"I should enter and see what's yet  in  the stores". Quite nothing in
fact, but my  eyes  where  attracted  by  a  little black cover, with
strange red fishes. On the cover, just a  label  with  a name  and  a
title : Uncle Meat : Swallow !!!

The world is very small.... Well, I  have  bought  this  album ( at a
very ridiculous price ( a little more than.... 1 $ !!! ).
( Afreak,  excuse  me  for  this  price, it's a  good business for my
wallet but your music deserves more than it !!! ;-) ).

I introduced the CD in the player, and  I  went surprised by the good
sound coming from the speakers. I didn't  know  what  kind  of  music
Uncle Meat was playing, but it's Metal  and  I like Metal. Sometimes,
it makes me think to Channel Zero ( another  belgian group ), but the
voice is different, lower than the singer of this band.

The composition are well build, the guitars  are very present, and if
I have well understood, there is only 1 guitar player ( who  is  also
the singer ).

This album pleased me and I would like  to listen to the second crime
of Uncle Meat ;-) .

Just a note, it's the third CD I bought this day, and  it's the third
without the lyrics !!! @{b}IS IT A CONSPIRATION AGAINST SINGERS ????@{ub}

So, if you see  this album on  the  shelves, you can support a friend
and buy it !

You can visit their internet site and leave them a message on :
