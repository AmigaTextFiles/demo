If you downloaded this Magazine from Aminet, then firstly Thanks and secondly
If you wish to run it from Hard drive, then make the following assign to the 
Directory in which you put it, you could also use to installer that is on 
disk three, but you would need to extract all the disks first, Cheers 
SLADE/a51.  The best way is to cut the out from a word processor and then 
use Amigados to make a script, this it what I have done.

ASSIGN BEYOND>THE<FRONTIER5(DISK-1): beyond_Dest?/
ASSIGN BEYOND>THE<FRONTIER5(DISK-2): beyond_Dest?/
ASSIGN BEYOND>THE<FRONTIER5(DISK-3): beyond_Dset?/

There were also a few files I had to leave out, due to the Aminet 
restrictions.  Everyone should have these files anyway, so it should`nt be 
must of a problem, if DMC asks for a certain library then copy it to the 
drawer where disk 1 is located.
