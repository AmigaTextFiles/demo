@node introduction "x-files - introduction"

                              introduction

ok, you have survived the first issue of x-files and so you had to get
the second issue, because you want to stay informed... :-)

the response was not as big as i have hoped, but for a first issue it
was not bad.

there are some changes in this issue:

 - if you go to the group-selection via first-letter, then :

   - if there are information about groups, the letter is marked with
     a  @{b}.@{ub}  on every side of the gadged.

     it will look like this :       .@{"  E  " link e}. 


   - if there are @{b}new@{ub} information about groups, the letter is marked
     with a  @{b}:@{ub}  on both sides of the gadged.

     it will look like this :       :@{"  E  " link e}:


   - if you have selected a sub-page via a first-letter, there you can
     also see which group has @{b}new@{ub} information to present.
     if there are changes or new information about one of the groups in
     the list, you can see this by the  @{b}:@{ub}  on both sides of the
     gadget.

     it will look like this :       :@{" ethic " link "ethic"}:


   if you want to now if there are information about some groups, you don't
   have to look under every single letter now. look for the .'s and the :'s
   and you will know if there are changed news or if there is everything
   unchanged.


 - now you can use your own font to look at the x-files. it was only a test,
   that i have defined the topaz.font. i forgot to take it out of the
   ready-to-release version

 - small "secret" part included... try to find it. it's not real hidden,
   but it's funny !!!

ok, these are the changes for this issue. if you have some ideas to make
x-files more comfortable for you, then send me your ideas and i will tra to
build them in.

you can also send me a message to tell me if you like or hate the x-files,
or if you only want to talk with me about anything. :-)


now a request from me to :

if you are an ascii-artist, please make me an x-files (only small letters if
possible) logo and send it to one of my addresses or search for me in some
boards, mostly in berlin / germany...


ok, thanx for now and see ya soon...

@node wanted "wanted"

for the x-files i'm searching for up-to-date news:

with news i mean:

            - memberlists (with username and function (and land if possible))
            - newcommers (with old group if possible)
            - "go-away'ers" (with reason like new group, kicked, left scene))
            - general news about groups (like next releases, planed projects
                                         planned parties, and so on...)
            - information about parties (like invitations, results, reports,
                                         visitor-lists)
            - news about everything that's worth interesting

i can not check every news i get. so it is possible, that an error appears in
the x-files. don't blame me for this, but please mail me the error with the
correction and i will fix it immediately.

i am also searching for ascii-logos for x-files. 

so, if you have news, corrections, comments, suggestions, ideas or anything
else worth mentioning, then contact me at:

@node mekka1996 "Mekka 1996"

 MEKKA 1996

 Mekka 1996 will be organized by - amable -

 29th - 31st of March 1996  in  HITTFELD / GERMANY

  I. Introduction / About Mekka '96
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   No long introduction... There will be a new Demo-Party in germany.
   We do not expect it to be GiGANTIC or GREAT ... we want it to be small
   and special. We try to connect a little group of talented guys, cheap
   entrance fees and some kewl prices for the Compos.
   
   The main intention of MeKKa is, to create a GATHERING , with some WiRED
   attenders who'll make it to THE PARTY of the year.
   [Sorry... don't know how to insert "Assembly" in this ;)]

   We expect you to go on a pilgrimage to demo-Mekka'96 and have fun you
   never thought about.


  II. Where and When
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The Party will be held near Hamburg, the second largest city in Germany.
   We will rent a congress center with room for about 700 persons and 500
   computers.
   First we thought of renting the "Congress Center Hamburg" ... But we
   could not know how many guys will enter the arena -> so we've decided
   to use the smaller room! We do NOT expect more than 700 guys to attend...
   really ;)!

   Date    : Friday 29 to Sunday 31 of March 1996
             The doors will be opend on Friday at 18h [6pm]

   Location: Veranstaltungszentrum "BURG" Seevetal in Hittfeld/Germany
             That's very close to Hamburg.

   The center lies between 3 motorways so it's the easiest way to get there
   by car/bus, but to come by train and airplane will be possible too
   although it is more expansive.


  III. Costs
  ~~~~~~~~~~
   As you know Mekka will be held the first time in 1996. To calculate how
   many people we have to expect please registrate. Therefor you will get
   a reserved table for your computer(s). The earlier you reserve the better
   will be the place of the table reserved for you in the party-room (to read
   about registering scroll down a bit).

   Entrance fee:
   .............
   You pay in advance  : DM 25,- / person (about 17 US-Dollars)
   You are registered  : DM 30,- / person (about 21 US-Dollars)
   Without registration: DM 35,- / person (about 25 US-Dollers)

   The organisation is NON-COMMERCIAL!!! As usual the entrace-fee will be
   distributed among the winners of the competitions.

  VIII. Network
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Many parties in the last time had a party-network and we are trying to
   have one too. It has a lot of advantages e.g.

     - voting will be more easier and secure and

     - all the entries of the competition will be stored on the server and
       will be free to download a competition is finished.

   We do NOT guarantee the network, but we will try very hard to get one!


  IX. CD-ROM

   We think that a CD-ROM is not the most important feature of a Party (!)
   but we hope to have a Party-CDROM anyhow. We will try hard too!


  X. T-Shirt
  ~~~~~~~~~~
   Nearly every party has a Party T-Shirt. We will produce a T-Shirt too...

   It will be a very HIGH-Quality-shirt. It'll be designed by a well known
   local guy, who already designed VERY kewl shirts.

   You'll love it but remeber... it's limited!!!


  XI. Sponsors
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   We have not finished the conversation with all of our sponsors so we are
   not able to give you a list of them yet.

     - We can tell you that one of our sponsors will be a well known
       international software-producer! [NOT MS! ;) ]

   The complete list of sponsors will be released in a few days!


  XII. Registration
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There are a lot of reasons why you should registrate. If you send the
   registration form back to us you will

     - save money because of a reduced entrace-fee (see above),

     - get a better table (next the stage and the projector) and

     - help us to calculate how many people we have to expect.

   If not we cannot guarantee a free table for your computer.

   PLEASE CHOOSE A PASSWORD for protecting your registration and your
   directory on the party-server (if we get one, see above). Nobody else
   but you will have access to your handle.

         TNX in advance!
