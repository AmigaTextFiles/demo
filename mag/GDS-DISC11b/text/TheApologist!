I was supposed to send you back many many years ago with the
latest issue of D.I.S.C, but that never happened. Instead I've delayed
some of you for years. Yes, quite many years infact. And some I never did reply
at all. As so many years have passed, I've lost your addresses and
sendings, but I really do want to get in touch with you all again. So I've
tried to find a few of your addresses and send this issue of D.I.S.C. to
you. As for the others I was in touch with so many years ago, and still
are waiting for a sending from me: Please recontact me, and I do promise
to reply faster.«»

All I really can say is that I'm terrible sorry! I hope you can forgive me!«»
