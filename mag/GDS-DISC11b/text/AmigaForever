«c2»"Are you using my own words against me now are you?"«»

«c5»To read more from our young apprentice, the selfappointed king of chocago and
pacmania... The PC-maniac «c6»Magic Of Nah-Kolor, «c5»turn the page!«»
«c6»1. MAGIC'S HISTORY«»
==================«»
«»
«c5»In the editorial of Devotion is stated: "I have been around so long and
still I am on TOP". How long have you been on the top, and how long have
you been around ?«»
«»
«c2»"Hehe.. Are you using my own words against me now are you? :) I started on
 Amiga back in 1988, after my glancy c-64 period.. It wasn't untill 1999
 untill I joined my first Amiga group Exotic. While I started writing
 articles in 1992. So I have been actively writing since 1992 for magazines..
 I have to add that in 1992 I wrote for a dutch diskmag only called Jong
 Snel & Wild..;) in 1993 (January to be exact) my first english article was
 published in magbox issue 5. (Yes Upstream pre-succesor diskmag main-edited
 by good old Wolfman..) With my editorial in Devotion issue 1 I tried to
 express a feeling.. But you just typed one sentence of the whole editorial
 so I advice you as reader to read the whole editorial to find our what I
 ment :) All in all I am actively writing since 1992 and I am around on Amiga
 since 1988.."«»
«»
«»
«c5»Which mags have you worked for. If possible state the year and which mags you
have worked for that period. (like 1988 - Cracker Journal, 1989 - Zine etc.)«»
«»
«c2»"Thank god I started to log my work around the mid 90's.. To bad that from
 1993 untill 1995 I didn't :) I have much memory of ALL mags I supported..
 But there will be mags missing on this list you requested in the period
 1993-1995 !! I will try to make an accurate overview for you.. By the way,
 I main-edited all THING issues, Chit Chat issue 14 and 15, Showtime issue 4,
 Retro issue 4 and Devotion issue 1 ofcourse.. :) I co-edited Raw issue 9
 and 10 (Online), Lazur even painted Raw issue 10 title pic on my request :)
 I also was co-editor for alot of Eurochart issues.. ANd ofcoz my infamous
 Magical Moments corner.. Ever read one? :) Fasten your seatbelts, here we
 go... (Hello Lord Helmet, do you remember the RAW issue 8 intro? :)"«»
«»
«c5»To main-edit is a word which can be misused. ChitChat 14 for instance had
3 main-editors which together managed to present 17 files!«»

«»
«c5»Which Magazine you've been working for do you appreciate the most?
And why?«»
«»
«c2»"Ehm.. Let me see here.. I think Generation issue 22 because I wrote
 an Abnominio and signed it with Macno's name and RokDaZone published
 it not knowing I wrote the darn thing :P Raw 10, because I was almost
 the only active writer for it, which wasn't such a surprise since RAW
 issue 9 was put together of the best articles supposed to be for Upstream
 11, but Upstream died and Mount gave all articles to Astro.. :)
 Thing was a crazy period in my life.. I was young, eager and furious
 on articles I read.. That was something.. That was 100% true scening..
 Chit Chat was a nice period aswell. As issue 15 was the first AGA diskmag
 ever released on the Amiga Scene.. While the EC was the first AGA chart
 ever released on the Amiga Scene.. Do you all remember the great AGA
 layout by Danny? :)"«»
«»
«c5»You've written quite many articles. Which article of yours are the best yet
written?«»
«»
«c2»The first article which comes to my mind after reading your question
is 'The Circle Of Life' published in Showtime issue 1. But it's a difficult
question. I feel like saying that 1996 and 1997 I wrote my best
articles.. (I think..) Just go download all diskmags from the list above
and read my work! :-)"«»
«»
«»
«c5»Why do you think your best articles were written in this period? Do you
feel you were more "into" the scene then compared to now?«»
«»
«c2»"No I don't feel I was more in the scene than now. I think it's because
 I had more time than as I have now to write.. And you have to recognize
 when you are actively writing as long as I am, you come to a certain point
 where the articles you write are 'more of the same'.. If you know what I
 mean here.."«»
«»
«»
«c6»2. D.I.S.C.«»
===========«»
«»
«c5»What do think of the slogan "DISC - Dead and loving it?"«»
«»
«c2»"I truely hope you release a new issue of Disc this year (2000)
 otherwise I will get paranoid again, stating it's again a conspicary
 like those last 5 years were which stated the same thing, disc will
 be released soon :P"«»
«»
«c5»Too bad... we guess you've also become paranoid now then.«»
«»
«»
«c5»We in DISC are gonna beat your mag real hard. Do you think DISC is gonna
kick Devotion down the charts?«»
«c2»"DISC has only one advantage looking at Devotion and that is it's name..
 All the rest depends on the quality of the contents. And the layout and
 music and code.. I am also curious if the staff of DISC writes the 'core'
 part of the magazine contents, or if it's based on support from other
 sceners.. (this mostly says something about the future of a magzine,
 if you know what I mean.. :) Ofcourse DISC is going to kick Devotion down
 the charts.. Disc is the best diskmag ever!!!!!!! (Honoustly:)"«»
«»
«»
«c6»3. DEVOTION«»
===========«»
«»
«c5»Would you consider Devotion to be your new way of life?
Can you describe the Devotion staff? What's the future of Devotion?
Will it be online? Move to PC?«»
«»
«c2»"It's my new way of life, in the sentence that it's a nice hobby to have
 next to real life existence. Everybody needs a nice hobby now ain't we? :)
 The staff is Darkus and Me (Main-ed) Teis,Makke,Alvin (co-ed) and Mr.tickle
 coder and supporter.. NO, not online and NO also not PC. Amiga forever! :)"«»
«»
«»
«c5»Looking at the staff of Devotion and the words you wrote about the future of
a diskmag depends on how much the staff write; how would you say the future
of Devotion look like now?«»
«»
«c2»"The near future look quite good.. I can't predict the continuation
 on the long run no one can.. Afterall Lord Helmet 'did' Raw only for
 a couple of years also :)"«»
«»
«c5»Lord Helmet did RAW issue 1 to 7, lasting from 1991 to 1995, and with
support for issue 9 and 10 as well. That's not a "few" years.«»
«»
Darkus is your co-main editor. What is he doing and what are you doing?
Is Devotion the project of Darkus or are you two equal partners? Who has the
last word?«»
«»
«c2»"Infact I am Darkus his co-main editor.. Atleast this was the case with issue
 1. Now with issue 2 I have more the initiative at the moment. Darkus
 just became a 20 year old father and moved to a new home. By the way, I
 am more involved with writing and collecting articles, arranging the
 titlepic while Darkus does all the editing (!) and stuff like that.. We are
 2 equal partners.. I won't release an issue without Darkus, and I hope
 he won't without me :P"«»
«»
«»
«c5»Every mag has its groupies. Who are your 10 biggest fans ?«»
«»
«c2»"Ehm Ehm.. 10 ? I only can recall Wade, Darkhawk I dunno..
 I forever keep asking for ego-stimulation at magic_mi@dds.nl
 after issue 1 got released I got none.. :("«»
«»
«c5»Darkhawk and Wade you're biggest fans? Well... not according to them.«»
«»
«»
«c6»4. AMIGA FUTURE«»
===============«»
«»
«c5»DESCRIBE the future of the amiga:«»
«»
«c4»DREAM: «c2»"I am to adult to start dreaming now.. However
       Amiga forever! :P"«»
«»
«c4»REALISTIC: «c2»"Getting smaller and smaller, afterall nothing lasts forever
            even the Sun in the sky will vanish eventually. Think about
            it!"«»
«»
«c4»PESIMISTIC: «c2»"It died a few years ago ?"«»
«»
«»
«c5»What do you consider the chances for AmigaOne to succeed?«»
«»
«c2»"What the hell is AmigaOne ? (Honoustly :)"«»
«»
«c5»Hey... we're asking the questions here! Anyway, if you want to know more
about AmigaOne which is the first hardware from Amiga the last 6 years, then
check out: www.amiga.com. AmigaOne might be the future of the Amiga. It's
possible to upgrade current A1200s and A4000s.«»
«c5»What kind of computer equipment do you think a scener should need to run
todays diskmags?«»
«»
«c2»"A normal amiga 1200 computer, maybe a little more memory than the
 standart a1200 has.. But that's fine.. Afterall it's the contents
 that counts, not the mag engine with the latest TBL demo running
 in it :P"«»
«»
«»
«c5»What kind of computer equipment do you use nowadays?«»
«»
«c2»"Sadly a PC.. Not that I am sad or anything though :) Internet and E-mail
 keep me updated on the Amiga scene, Nah-kolor and my writing activity's..
 By the way  it has been like this since November 1996 :)) (Truth!)"«»
«»
«»
«c5»Are you kidding? Have you been 4 YEARS without Amiga??? How do you manage to
stay updated concerning the DEMO scene? Have you been able to watch your own
mag? Are you using emulators?«»
«»
«c2»"I am not kidding :) But I see demos on my friends amiga down the street;
 On party's.. It's no problem.. And internet and irc helps alot to
 stay informed also.. UAE on «c4»PC rulez :)"«»
«»
«c5»Well, The DISC Team think it got to be sad NOT even seeing your own mag! And
besides, hearing about the routine in a demo is not the same as seeing one.
It's like reading the review of a movie. And going to ONE party in 5 years
can't really compensate much. But as you say: Amiga rules!«»
«»
«»
«c6»5. DISKMAGS/EDITORS«»
===================«»
«»
«c5»Do you think the mags are focusing too much on other mags and editors and
NOT on the demo scene?«»
«»
«c2»"Maybe.. Maybe not.. Haven't paying much attention in that direction
 actually.. A good mag should have various and equal amount of articles
 and topics.. And not 99 articles about the magscene and 1 about the
 demo scene.. But I think that's obvious :P I do think that diskmags
 nowdays rely to much on support and not on the work of the staff and
 more over the main eds..!!"«»
«»
«»
«c5»How would you say the "balance" in Devotion 1 was?«»
«»
«c2»"Darkus could have written more :) But for issue one he spended alot
 of time orginizing layout, cliparts, getting the code finished, editing
 for issue 2 he promised to write more.. The balance is ok, maybe some
 more support is at it's place."«»
«»
«c5»How would you say the quality of todays mags are compared to the ones five
years ago?«»
«»
«c2»"On the graphics and music side they have become better.. Because of internet
 it's alot easier to arrange this.. However these days alot of magazines
 that get released depends on the support of sceners than on the staff itself.
 In earlier times you had Wolfman/Mount for Upstream, Mop for Rom or Fishwave
 for Seenpoint if you like who wrote alot articles themselfs; Therefor you had
 an overall quality in every issue.. That is something that has changed I
 suppose in the mags of today.. The beginning of 1995 was a highlight when
 Rom, Raw and Upstream were all alive and kicking! :P And ofcoz the end
 of the 80's and beginning of the 90's when dozens of diskmags got released.."«»
«»
«»
«c5»What do you think about the following mags that are more or less alive:«»
«»
«c4»EuroChart; «c2»The chartsmag which get released 3-4 times a year. Which helps
alot for there popularity.. Sometimes they get alot of support for an issue
sometimes they got less. I was co-editor for the magazine for 2 years or
so.. It's my favourite..«»
«»
«c4»ShowTime; «c2»Issue 4 was the best; (Guess why :P It's ok.. Issue 14 got alot
of critics becoz they used alot of articles already released on PC. (HUGI)«»
«»
«c4»Oepir Risti; «c2»I Don't think Oepir Risti is still alive:) It was a nice
magazine. I sometimes missed to less articles about the scene. But
it was a nie magazine overall..«»
«»
«c5»(Last issue got released in March 2000)«»
«»
«c4»TrashCan; «c2»I never saw or read Trashcan I am afraid.. Silly me :P«»
«»
«c4»Jurassic pack; «c2»Ghandy & Co.. Maybe www.scenet.de is better :) Always
rocked. But than again when will there be a new issue released ? ..«»
«»
«c5»(It has merged with D.I.S.C.)«»
«»
«»
«c5»Which editors do you consider to be the most active & the best ones last
year?«»
«»
«c2»"Good Question.. Darkhawk released alot of articles; But they seem to be
 hasty written in my oppinion. None the less a very active writer in 2000.
 (Same counts for me though :P The other way around is Wade. he wrote some
 very good and quality articles but he didn't write many articles overall
 in 2000. But he is good enough to mention. Than there is Alvin. He released
 quite much articles in EC#40 and Devotion issue 1. Ghandy deserves a small
 notice for his scenet.de That's about it I reckon.. (Anyone I forgot? :)"«»
«»
«c5»Name 5 all-time best editors which have been present on the Amiga scene.
(you can name yourself if you want)«»
«»
«c2»"Ofcourse I can't name myself. Other people should judge that :P«»
«»
here we go: Orlando/Zine, Wolfman&Mount/Upstream, Mop/Rom, RokDaZone/Various
and Macno/Abnormalia in non specific order.."«»
«»
«c5»Of course you can name yourself if you think you deserve it... like you
already did when commenting ShowTime!«»
«c2»"I commented Showtime that correct.. It rather says something about all the
 other issues of Showtime than about me I am afraid :)"«»
«»
«»
«c5»Do you think there are other MAGS than DISC and DEVOTION that will
survive through 2001?«»
«»
«c2»"Who says that DISC and DEVOTION will survive 2001 ? Your being to
 optimistic here. You can't possibly know what the future will bring.
 I think the EC will survive atleast since Iris will continue if Depth
 falls away :P Besides 1 disc per 5 years is really enough!!! :))"«»
«»
«»
«c5»Are there enough editors to support 5 active scene-mags?«»
«»
«c2»"Sure, but it depends on the staff of every magazine they must do the most
 articlewriting and the friends have to support it a little to finish
 the magazine .. (Silly you;P"«»
«»
«»
«c5»But isn't it a fact that most editors are writing for all mags nowadays?«»
«»
«c2»"Supporting alot of mags yes. But in my oppinion an editor should have
 one 'core' magazine to release his work. And in between issues he could
 support other magazines.."«»
«»
«»
«c5»Do you prefer the aggressive scene-journalism of past mags like RAW or
the more research-journalism of Upstream?«»
«»
«c2»"Hehe Depends on the subject and what your goal is with the article..
 Non the less an article could be agressive as long it's written objective
 otherwise it's another mud-trowing article no one seems to care about.
 The trick is to make people believe it at the same time so the article
 has a certain impact.. Therfor I prefer a mixture in an article :P"«»
«»
«»
«c6»6. POLAND«»
=========«»
«»
«c5»And then, what do you think about all the Polish mags? Do they deserve
their high positions at the charts?«»
«»
«c2»"Yes and No.. Read my article called 'The Poland Debate' in EC#41.. I
 written 5100 bytes about this subject in this article..:) The charts is
 based on english magazines. Western sceners judges magazines on this.
 Which doesn't mean polish mags are bad but since we can't obviously
 read Polish we never gonna find out. What I hear Polish mags have great
 gfx and msx but that's logical looking at the Polish scene.."«»
«»
«»
«c5»Would you like to discriminate polish voters to equal the number of
international and polish voters at the various charts?«»
«»
«c2»"I don't think discriminate is the right word. Again I would point at
 my article in EC#41. If you have an equal amount of voters from every
 scene country you get a better view on what's hot and not in the EC or
 any other chart."«»
«»
«»
«c5»But to remove Polish votes to make an equal amount of international and
polish voters, isn't that to discriminate the polish sceners as their vote
is less worth?«»
«»
«c2»"What a bull question :) The point is to make for example the Official
 Eurochart a good view of what is hot and not in today's Amiga Scene..
 To achieve that goal a certain strategy is needed. You didn't read my
 article in EC#41 yet did you? :) You need a good balance.. Do you
 discriminate when Disc has more articles about diskmags than about
 other topic's ? :)"«»
«»
«c5»No, we didn't read your article... we seldom do. You can discriminate SCENERS as
they are persons which should have the same value. 1 vote from Poland
should be counted equal to 1 vote from the western sceners!
To choose what topics we want to include in mag is of course completely
different.«»
«»
«»
«c6»7. HATE«»
=======«»
«»
«c5»There have been hate-articles written against you in lots of mags in the
past; like ROM, Generation and JP. Even your old group member Retep in 
Mirage hate you? Lord Helmet thinks that hate grows with popularity.
Do you agree? Or do you hate Lord Helmet?«»
«»
«c2»"Hate grows with popularity ? Well I think what Lord ment is that the popular
 you become the more attention you get and thus the more there is looked at
 you, positive but also negative. Critism it's called.. Retep of Mirage..
 now that has been a while. Did you know he had to marry his girlfriend
 becoz of her father? She was from foreign country were it's a custom
 that you have to marry her when the father say so.. poor Retep :)
 Yeay well in the past there have been articles about me in diskmags..
 (Lord Helmet should know this situation himself..:) But that has been
 few years ago.. Now everything is fine.. I am doing a nice diskmag called
 Devotion, have been co-ed of the Eurocharts.. All is fine.."«»
«»
«c5»Is it? The Scoopex (is dead) incident didn't happen many years ago...«»
«»
«c2»"What incident? I just interviewed Karpow about the current status
 at the end of 1999 of Scoopex. Karpow stated on #amigscne Scoopex was
 dead because Antibyte left etc. Ofcourse after the article/interview
 to uphold the name Scoopex they brought out other news like we are asleep
 and so on.. :)"«»
«»
«»
«c5»Which scener(s) are you most disappointed of?«»
«»
«c2»"RokDaZone for dissapearing like that without saying goodbye to the
 scene.. Astro for letting RAW die after only 2 issues done by him.
 Hmm maybe only 1 becoz issue 9 was put together with a lot of support
 and Upstream 11 articles :P
 Metal Designer for leaving Nah-kolor infavour of Scoopex and not releasing
 anything in this group. Evan for leaving Nah-kolor after all those years..
 I am also dissapointed at Dr.jeckell and Mr.Hyde; They could have written
 more bad shit in Nexus 7 about Lord Helmet than they did.. And finally
 Antibyte of Scoopex: he knows why :)"«»
«»
«»
«c5»Do you understand some of the critism? Why do you think you're such
a controversial scener?«»
«»
«c2»"What critism? Be more specific.. I am not a controversial scener.
 I am whatever they say I am.. I rest my case.."«»
«»
«»
«c5»To be more specific... we were refering to you getting critics after
writing articles which certain sceners think are untrue
(like Scoopex is dead).«»
«c2»"To get critics is always good if it's objective and well said. Haha
 my Scoopex is dead article in EC #38 was true at that point of time..
 Again, all I did was interview Karpow of Scoopex about it who announced the
 dead of Scoopex at #amigascne.. By the way, have you seen any Scoopex
 demo since TP'98 ? ;-) I rest my case.."«»
«»
«»
«c6»8. SCENE«»
========«»
«»
«c5»What's the first amiga demo you've ever seen? What's the first party you
visited?«»
«»
«c2»"My first Amiga demo.. Geezz I don't remember :P My first party I ever visited
 was Prime'90 hold by Mirage.. Now those were the day's! The first demo I
 saw was in 1988.. Phew the hardest question of this entire interview..
 One of the first games I played was Zak Mc Cracken on Amiga.. :)
 Hmm maybe one of the first demos I saw was a Northstar demo ?"«»
«»
«»
«c5»How many sceners would you estimate are still active?«»
«»
«c2»"Two maybe three thousand ?"«»
«»
«»
«c5»How does the future of the scene look like ? Do you think the present scene
is what most sceners thought about the C64 scene 5 years ago ?«»
«»
«c2»"The future is where we are going.. The Amiga Scene will get smaller and
 smaller ofcourse.. Untill the day the last Amiga Scener decites to quit.
 and untill that day I can't leave.. :) You could compare the c64 and
 amiga scene to eachother.. I don't know what most sceners think though :)"«»
«c5»What do you think about the standard of the best demos the latest 12 months; 
like Rain, Concrete and Cybercinematastic for instance?«»
«»
«»
«c2»"Can't comment on that.. Haven't seen those demos ;-) But my feelings tell
 me because I have lived trough earlier times I know back than the standart
 of the demos were higher for those times; Than the demos we have now for
 the times we live in now.. (Do you know what I mean here :P I think this
 is the case for alot of 'older' sceners..«»
«»
«»
«c5»Do you think you're in the scene in TWO years from now for instance?«»

«c2»"I will still look at the scene and write articles.. Unless something goes
 terribly wrong and we all die becoz of the Ozonlair or a nuclair disaster
 or global heating or big huge tornado's.. :)"«»

«c5»What's the current status of the dutch scene and do you have the knowledge
to write a dutch scene-report?«»
«»
«c2»The current status of the dutch scene is that there isn't a dutch scene :)
Just a hand full of sceners doeing something. (Idl'ng on IRC :-)
So there isn't much to write.. I could write about the active days
of the Dutch scene :P (e.g. Mirage, Jetset, Royal Amiga Force, Vision, 
Desire etc.)«»
«»
«»
«c5»What do you think about inactive sceners that are now only on PC hanging out
at #amigascne?«»
«»
«c2»"It's nice that they still show some interest. You can't be active forever
 and it's nice you meet oldies on the irc. They inspire the active sceners
 with oldskool stories and we writers have some nice interviews we can make.
 What a negative vibe is hanging around your question :)"«»
