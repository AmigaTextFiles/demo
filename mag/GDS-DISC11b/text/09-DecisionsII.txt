follow  a  few  thoughts before I will
get off here...«»

We all have to make decisions all  the
time. I am  no  exception.  Real  life
takes  a  lot of energy when you don`t
have the school for sleeping  anymore.
And only 4 hours each night for a long
time will surely kill you, so you have
to decide what is more important.
Once I was a fast swapper but now I am
delaying to some of  my  contacts  for
nearly a year,  just because of my old
job  and  "real life"  problems.   And
although I became 6th in the Eurochart
I decided to be a friendshipper with a
smaller  circle  of close friends only
trading  slow   packages   with   long
letters.   Former   I   had  about  80
contacts,  but I can not fit with more
than 30 at all today.  So I will be no
real swapper anymore.  This was a hard
decision, because I loved to have many
contacts  everywhere and to exchange a
lot of stuff this way.  I also decided
to leave the ascii  business.  I  will
continue  making  some  logos if I get
requests   and  releasing  collections
from time to time as guest under other
lables, but because  I  never  was  so
good  to call myself a real artist and
because of the lack of time I  had  if
I  would take this function as serious
as I did, I will do it  just  for  fun
from now on.«»

I want to thank my closest friends for
the  moral  support  they gave me over
the years and my swapper contacts  for
the almost nice stuff and letters.
Thanks  also  for  voting for me but I
don`t deserve it anymore. Sorry, pals!
But this is not the end.
Please don`t think that I become elite
now or already became. I just selected
what is more important for me.  I want
to  be  active  in scene as long as it
will  exist if possible,  but I am not
able to do everything the  same  time.
Even   not   if   I   would  become  a
24-hours-a-day scener again.  But I am
still  a scener because this is what I
want to be.  I only decided to be more
active  as  editor  now  and to finish
some   other  big  projects  like   my
encyclopedia about the american sci-fi
author Philip K.Dick.
I  will  not  tell  you  more about my
"real life",  my girl,  my future  (if
there  is  any...)   at   this  point,
because   you   surely   read   enough
appologies  like  the  one which would
follow.    If   you   are   interested
although, drop  my  a  few  lines  and
just  wait  for  a  detailed  but slow
answer via snail-mail.«»

Now let me still add  something  about
the articles you read before:
"Muffling Around"  is  a  little  play
with words.  In Germany muffling means
to  grumble  around. Also don`t forget
that the  story,  all  characters  and
time  periods  are  only  fiction. Any
similarity to living persons is...
"The Way Of Life I want"  you   should
take  really serious instead because I
wrote it with the whole of my soul!
Many thanks  also  to  the independent
Incognito for a lot of inspiration and
the proofreading of "Cultivications".«»

At  last  I can only tell you to start
or continue supporting  the  scene  in
any way, I surely will...«»
