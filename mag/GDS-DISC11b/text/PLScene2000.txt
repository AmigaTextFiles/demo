«c1»This is a small report from the Polish Scene, and you will find
 information here about some of the groups that are active. Due to the huge
 amounts of material to write about, and then I'm thinking of which groups
 to include, I had to select a few only. So, it's therefore not a complete
 report, only 80% I think. However, hope you will enjoy it as much as I did
 writing it! Here we go!«»

 «c6»Apathy Poland:«»
 --------------«»
 «c1»The Polish division of Apathy currently consists of a handful of members,
 and some of them are very skilled in what they do. This year they have
 released some 4K intros and 64K intros. They are at the moment working on
 a slideshow featuring graphics by Rebel and some other not so important
 productions. Well worth noticing is that Zeeball, the main coder, have
 been very actice releasing utilities lately.«»
«»
 Three months ago, many members of the Polish division was kicked due to
 unactivity, and this have caused the group to function better than before.«»

 «c6»Appendix:«»
 ---------«»
 «c1»Two weeks ago, Appendix kicked us in the face with two great demos, "I
 Want To Be Machine" and "Mayhem". Both of them are of very high quality,
 and gives us an impression that this group definitly is here to stay.
 Beside these demos, they have also released an issue of their diskmag,
 "Taboo". This mag is as far as I've understood, very popular in Poland.
 In the future, I hope to see more productions from this crew, and I hope
 they manage to live up to the two demos released at the Satellite party.«»

 «c6»Attic:«»
 ------«»
 «c1»This group is quite new on the Scene, and if I remember correctly, it was
 formed in June 2000. If this is wrong, then please blame my memory.
 However, at the moment they haven't released anything particular, but it's
 possible that they will manage to make something in the future. Let us
 wish them good luck!«»

 «c6»Decree:«»
 -------«»
 «c1»If you don't remember the demo "Planet Goa" from Satellite 2000, I feel
 sorry for you. Even if it is a little bit slow on 040 25mhz (which I have)
 I can see that they have improved dramatically during the last year. This
 production is quite impressing when thinking of both routines and design.
 I really hope they will be more active in the future. Apart from this
 demo, they are releasing their diskmagazine "The Deep" and their pack
 "Greenday". Two ok productions. Last mentioned is a little bit special, as
 it has charts of best "Punkrock bands" etc.«»
«»
 Some months ago, Spectra (Musician) and Deadman (Swapper) decided to team
 up with them. It seems like this was a wice choice, when thinking about
 their latest demo.«»

 «c1»This is like Attic, a fairly new group on the Scene. It was formed in May
 2000, as a co-operation between the old groups Breathe and Oxygen. At the
 moment, I haven't seen any productions from them, but they may surprise us
 in the future.«»

 «c6»Flopi:«»
 ------«»
 «c1»Earlier their name was Floppy, but now they have renamed to Flopi. Don't
 ask me why! Nothing much has happened in this group since the
 Mekka^Symposium 2000. At this party they released a 4K intro name "Fee"
 and a dentro named "Murderous". Worth noticing is that the old mega
 swapper Renton was kicked due to unactivity and that Azzaro took his place
 as the main swapper in Flopi.«»

 «c1»The last production we saw from Harvester was an intro named "Radial Blur"
 which was released at the Apocalypse party 2000. Check it out if you

 count with sometime.«»

 «c1»They have released almost too much productions in 2000! Being one of the
 most actice groups on the whole Scene, they do for sure deserve some
 higher rankings on the charts. This year they have released some issues of
 their "Save Da Vinyl" pack compiled by Azzaro and some issues of their
 swapper mag, "Zosia", which is being compiled by MCR. Both great
 productions. Beside this, they have released some other productions too,
 like a demo at the Assembly 2000. Also, the "Excess" mag is still being
 published.«»
«»
 A recent happening is that Jim (Editor/Swapper) have left the group, but
 he is still a member of the Excess staff.«»

 «c1»Being a member of Nah-Kolor myself, I will try to stay objective here. So,
 here goes! Recently they have not released any demos or intros on the
 Amiga, but they are a bit more active on the PC. However, their pack
 "Speed" has been frequently released under Evan. Sadly Evan decided to
 leave due to unknown reasons, and now Case have taken of the compiling.«»

 «c1»Potion struck us with the magnificent 64K intro "Gift" at the Symposium
 party. Other very good productions have been released, and it's no lie to
 say that this group is rocking the Polish Scene. A week ago they did also
 release a musicdisk which had nice design and well sounding tunes. One
 thing I must mention, is that Mavey has bought a PPC card...«»

 «c1»Hakon's group is as active as always. This year they have released plenty
 of issues of their pack, "Frozenpack", despite the compilers massive
 delay (Hakon: Send soon!!). Beside this, they have released some quality
 intros like "Aimless" at the Symposium party and "Heaven Is 2 Dimensional"
 at the Satellite party. An active and good group.«»
