«c1»You have reached the end of D.I.S.C. #11 - released in the year of 2001!«»
«»
Now you might ask if there will be another issue of D.I.S.C. and if so,
when will it be released?«»
«»
We can only answer the first question. Yes, there will come another issue
of this digital magazine as real legends can never die. However, we don't
know when it will be out yet. We can't give any promises, but will work
hard to bring you all another quality issue as soon as possible. Until
then, read all the articles you've missed so far. And of course enjoy the
other mags being released.«»

The last files we have included, are the history of D.I.S.C. so far.
These are the last words of this issue, but not the last words written
in the D.I.S.C. History.«»
