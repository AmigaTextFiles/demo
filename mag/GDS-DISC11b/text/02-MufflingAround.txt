«c2»And there is  Zito.  Standing  on  the
tram  station,  with  the   headphones
around  his  neck  sending noisy beats
from one ear to the other and a  back-
pack  between  his legs, waiting for a
waggon  to transport his tired body to
the place where he is working.
He put the portable cd-player  in  the
pocket of his  shorts  in  the morning
knowing that the weather of the coming
day will beat the days before and that
he will have to change his clothes  in
the  evening although he wear them the
first time today. In short: It will be
hot, even with the air-conditioning at
work.«»
The CD plays a new  record  from  TRSI
Records with tunes by a scenish artist
called Muffler and the mood of Zito is
getting  worse  with  every minute. He
liked   Muffler`s   demotunes,  so  he
bought his debut album directly  after
it  was  out  at the stores but he got
more than disappointed.While Muffler`s
modules   where  full  of  ideas   and
inspiration,   although   or    better
because  they  were depressive, the CD
tracks  became only monotone pieces of
boredom.  Filled with anger Zito plans
to  write  a critic in one of the next
coming diskmags. But  remembering  the
last night he  notices  that  he  read
about  someone who already has written
one.  Tonight  it has been released in
Devotion,  the new star on the diskmag
sky. Fresh and innovative. Hopefully a
star  the  scene  will  be able to see
more often than one time only.«»

Because the tram arrived at the  final
station,  Zito takes off and makes his
way to the last house in the only road
the  next  miles.   And  while  he  is
walking  he   reminds  on  Phoenix  by
Giants.  A  nice FASTRAM-diskmag which
was  released  two  times only and for
which he became co-editor right before
its death long ago.«»
`Ah!` a silent voice speaks to the man
who is happy that he  finally  entered
the house where a cool breeze surounds
him. `You  still  have  to  visit  the
website  of  Bjorn  Lynne  to  look if
there  is  another  demosong  for  the
sequel record of "Wolves Of The Gods"!
And  you have to visit your competitor
back2roots.org  to download a file you
are  still  missing.  Than you have to
visit  the  project you are supporting
called  "AmiSectorOne" (sorry for this
small  commercial  break  right  here!
http://amiga.emucamp.org)  to   upload
your  new  reviews. And...` Zito shuts
up the voice and enters the bureau  of
his boss, the man with the fat wart on
his  neck,  to  make some things going
the right way for the next week.«»

Entering  the  net  for   journalistic
research,   Zito  remembers  the  time
when  there  was  no  !nternet for the
public  available.  Also the amiga was
without it. Amiga and  !nternet  where
in any way  always  two  things  those
could  not  come  together  in  Zito`s
mind.  In "The Investore`s Club" or at
the  local  public  library  he  often
visited   the   net   for  information
research and e-mailing with friends by
using some x86 PeeCees,  but Amiga and
scene were always reachable for him by
snail-mail  only.  That  was  what the
scene stood for in his eyes. But today
he is clicking  his  way  through  the
pages  of the WWW regulary when he had
to work instead. Actually.  He  enters
the  world  of scene a quite different
way. And an easier one also.«»
To get into the scene these days isn`t
that hard anymore as it was in its and
his earlier lifetime. Then it was even
a ritual to become a member, but today
you only need to say you were a scener
and  you  `are`  one. And the scene is
shrinking though. Is  this  caused  by
its  liberality  or is the scene still
too close for newcomers?  Zito doesn`t
think  so,  although  he is a  friend-
shipper and really no elite guy.
His  mind  is  flying  and his fingers
are typing a new ftp-address to  leech
some files and suddenly  the  computer
specialist enters the room, asking for
the last month`s phone bill...«»

Some time after the lunch break Zito`s
thoughts are still rotating around the
stuff he should better think about  in
his  sparetime,  but  he can not avoid
them. He  remembers  his  first  touch
with the Amiga computer. Of course  he
was  as nearly every scener a gamer at
first. But infected  by  his  prefered
music  (movie  scores) he directly saw
(or better heard) more in the games he
was playing through the  nights,  then
only normal games.  While enjoying the
paramount  "Futur Wars"  and legendary
games like "Turrican" and "Apidya"  he
started  to  become  a fan of computer
music.  Especially  the music composed
by Chris Hülsbeck at first.
`These   were  great  times!`,  he  is
thinking  `Full  of   creativity   and
spirit.  That was what the Amiga meant
to  be!`  And  remembering  the  early
nineties  this  way  there   comes   a
question to his mind...  `And  today`s
music?`  Although  Zito  isn`t against
breakbeat  and  techno music, it seems
there are too  much  bases  and  drums
only around, too less sweet melodies.
Where have all the good musicans gone?
Left for PeeCee? Can`t be as he heard.
Or why is there not as  much  creative
spirit  left  as  before?  Maybe it is
just  a  kind  of  taste?  Or Zito has
simply missed the train  to  the  next
century? Maybe...«»
It  became  already  late and the time
passed fastly by thinking and surfing,
so   Zito  resets  the  computers  and
snapps  at  his  backpack. `Time isn`t
money but precious`,  so he hurries up
to get home as fast as possible.«»
«»
`And today`s games? Are there actually
new & good games released these days?`
Zito is nearly crying inside his  head
while  he  is  watching  for  the next
tram. `I need to stop  thinking  right
here` he commands himself. He jumps on
the waggon which has stopped in  front
of  him  and while the sun is setting,
he is driving the last tram the  wrong
direction. Too many thoughts...«»
«»
Zito returned home  late  because  the
tram  had  also  electricity  problems
caused by the hot weather.  The  whole
day  felt like a day after a worldwar.
And not being capable  of  making  any
conclusion  about  it,  he went to bed
and felt asleep one second after.«»
