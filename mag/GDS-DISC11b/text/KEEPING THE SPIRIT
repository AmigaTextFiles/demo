«c5»The most important thing on the scene
today, is the «c2»spirit «c5»that the sceners
possess. With spirit I mean the will
to create things and take part in the
scene. That spirit is what has driven
the scene for so long, ever since the
first crackintro appeared. What I want
to write about in this article is how
that spirit starts (or used to start),
and how it is becoming a bit harder to
hold on to that spirit in todays
scene. As such, this article bears
some resemblance to my other article
about the IRC, but that is hard to
avoid unless I fused the two articles
into one, and I'm much too lazy to do
that, afterall two fillers are better
than one, hehe.«»

Starting in the scene, you usually
have close contact to other sceners,
starting out like you do. In the older 
days, you all started out at once, and 
lived in the same town, making for a 
lot of «c2»friendship «c5»and working 
together. Nowadays the picture might 
be slightly different, with new 
sceners finding a group and friends 
via the IRC, but still you have some 
persons with whom you bond closer 
together than others, with whom you 
venture out with, creating your 
scenish spirit with. Whether that be 
over the IRC or in real life, you 
feel closer to these people than 
others in the scene. That in turn 
makes you able to create better and 
more things with that group than with 
any other person, because you feel 
motivated to do it. Taking the example 
of the local group, all in the same 
town, will serve my demonstration. 
With those you booze, talk and 
sometimes live, in a close 
relationship, and ofcourse that will
make you more motivated to do scenish
stuff, than if you were all living in
separate cities for example. The
«c2»spirit «c5»which you create in that way,
the «c2»motivation «c5»you have for the scene,
is what will drive you ever onwards
later, when all your friends have
gone, and you are alone in the scene,
making new friends and productions.
That initial motivation you got, that
initial wonder and awe you got for the
scene in that regard, is what will
push you onwards making you stay when
everything seems dead, changed and
silent. And things can feel that way
in the scene nowadays.«» 
«»
That «c2»initial feeling «c5»is what people
should strive for, if they want to
continue having fun in the scene and
not just live in the past, on past
feelings. The best way to keep people
together in the scene is the sociable
way, uniting a bunch of people in a
pursuit of similar things. Interest in
Amiga's, demos and making friends is
all it takes in the scene, but real,
physical interaction is a must here.
Only meeting via the IRC, visualizing
other people via the net is not enough
to maintain that spirit. You have to
be a bunch of friends, tied together
closely by friendship and identical
scene interests to really make the
magic happen, that is, to create
productions and feel happy about it.
When those friends move out (in the
example of living in one city), you
have to maintain contact and the
similar interest, or chances are good
(bad?) that everybody will loose
interest when they get other hobbies
and goals in their lives, and then
they will down-prioritize their former
scene interest, until they drop out
completely. You have to keep people
together in a sort of artificial way
at this point, which is a good point
when you want to defend the function
of an organizer. But that is a topic
for another article.«» 
«»
The reason people are quitting the
scene is simply that they loose
interest and motivation. That sounds
straightforward ofcourse, so why waste
an article about it? Just to make it a
filler? Yes that too ofcourse, but I
want to write about what you can do to
stop this downward spiral of
disinterest in the scene. Simply put,
what made you enter the scene were the
people, the social aspects, sharing
the same interest, and doing
productions that other people watched
and admired. That is, relationships to
other people is what defines the
scene, broadly speaking. You have to
keep those relationships going if you
want to maintain interest in the
scene. You can keep going on past
feelings of nostalgia and stuff like
that for quite some time, but sooner
or later your interest will run dry if
that's the only source of inspiration.
You have to be a member of a group of
dedicated people in contact and
friendship with eachother and you have
to participate in the scenish
happenings, then your interest will
hopefully never run dry. On the other
hand, if you feel that you are
isolated and out of touch with the 
scene, it is only a matter of time,
before you will quit. Therefore, make
the scene a sociable place, be
together with your group and
«c2»participate. «c5»That will insure that the
scene remains a fun and vibrant place.
Don't kill the scene by standing on
the sideline, make an effort to get
into the moving stream again if you're
one of those people feeling all alone
in the scene. We have to remember that
the scene is about persons and their
relationship to eachother, then the
«c2»scene will never die, «c5»regardless of
what computer we are on.«»
