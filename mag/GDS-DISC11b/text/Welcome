«c5»69...  it could be something nice, but we're talking about months!
69 months! That's the time since the last issue of D.I.S.C, and still
we are not forgotten! Still most sceners remember «c2»D.I.S.C. «c5»with joy,
we are more than pleased. Therefore we come back once again to give YOU
dear reader the best «c2»Digitial Information Service a Computerfreak «c5»can get!«»
«»
During these respective 6 years we have not rested one minute, but done
our best to bring back this «c2»legendary digital magazine. «c5»However, it has
not been easy because of all the «c2»overwhelming problems «c5»we have met. We will
not bore you with all the details... but refer to the article called
«c2»The D.I.S.C. History.«»
«»
«c5»The last years «c2»the scene «c5»has gone through «c2»many changes, «c5»and it has been
a rather hard time for the real amiga enthusiasts. The Amiga has frequently 
gotten new owners, but now finally, the «c2»Amiga Inc. «c5»has ended in the hands
of true amiga lovers and the «c2»future «c5»of the amiga looks much brighter.
Even though the lack of «c2»new hardware «c5»the last 6 years, the sceners have
continued to have «c2»faith «c5»in this fabolous machine and produced lots of
«c5»quality productions.«»
«»
«c5»Last year we got to see quite many high quality productions, such as the
demos «c2»Cybercinematastic, Megademo 2000, I Want To Be Machine, J, Abecedarian,
Arla, Violent Dumb, Back To The Roots, Smurphine - Another O.D,
Neo 2, At The Movies, First Awakening, New Age, Welcome To Our World, Pluss, 
Mayhem, Metatag «c5»and lots of others. We got to see great intros as «c2»Grid2,
Gift, Incision, Ten, Strange Distortion, Tourbus, Omnicrom, Suicidal,
Euskacktro, Modular, Heaven, Electricity, Yoo «c5»and many more. And lots of
mini intros (4k) such as «c2»Humus, Bier, Genoma, Mitosis, Wave, Noisejesus,
Fee, B0rst, Polychrome, Art Of 4k etc. «c5»And a few quality slideshows got
released, like «c2»Divine and Innocence. «c5»In addition to that, we got a few
musicdisks such as Schizofrenia and Despair. Read more about that elsewhere in
«c2»D.I.S.C.«»
«»
«c5»In the diskmag department not that much is happening anymore. 6 years ago
there were lots of quality mags around. Last year we got too see releases
of «c2»Devotion, SeenPoint and Oepir Risti, «c5»and the chartmags «c2»EuroChart and ShowTime. «c5»In
addition to that, some more national mags got out; like «c2»Excess, Beret,
Taboo and Dansktoppen. «c5»The only real regular internationl release was the
EuroChart. We could say the situation has been disasterous the latest
years, and it went worse with the departure of SeenPoint also. However, new
optimism returned with the new plans of D.I.S.C. and the release of
Devotion. But then two days ago it got announced that Devotion was «c2»dead,
«c5»and Magic released his files for Devotion 2. It seems he had gotten into a quarrel with «c2»Darkus. «c5»Anyway,
read more about that «l:articles/bonusreview»elsewhere in D.I.S.C.«le» and in the EuroChart #42. 
Nevertheless, the «c2»optimism «c5»is NOT gone. You're reading a HUGE issue of
D.I.S.C, and Magic has already announced the creation of a «c2»new mag «c5»under
the Nah-Kolor label. And now we're pleased to say that the magscene is better than in a 
long time. «c2»Taboo #3 «c5»got released earlier this year, in addition to the
Devotion 2 files (Party Zone and Magical Moments), the «c2»EuroChart «c5»will be out
the next DAYS, the «c2»ShowTime «c5»staff has
announced they will release their diskmag "soon" also and another issue of
«c2»Trashcan «c5»is under development. In addition to this
there are lots of packmags out there, and also many other packs. We just
have to mention that packs like «c2»Sabotage, Speed, FrozenPack, Zosia, Embrion and
Dreams «c5»are worth to have a look at.«»
«»
As for «c2»D.I.S.C, «c5»we hope to give you the best digital mag there is nowadays!
After months of real hard work, we are pleased to offer you over «c2»1 MB
«c5»of texts, which got to be the biggest scene-related magazine ever. We have
lots of illustrations to go with the various articles to make them «c2»more
interesting. «c5»In addition to the «c2»scene articles, «c5»we also offer a
«c2»«l:articles/gallery»bonus-gallery«le» and a «l:articles/charts»chart.«le» «c5»We have a highly advanced code which makes it
possible to include almost anything in the articles. Therefore we have
hidden many «c2»links «c5»to make it a bit more interesting. As the first mag ever, after
our knowledge, we inserted various modules in the articles. And we also
have links to various other stuff. So just «c2»click «c5»on various words and
you'll never know what happens! ;)  The code will be developed further and
taken to new heights in the next issues, as we have a very active mag
coder.«»
«»
When it comes to the «c2»«l:articles/team»CREDITS«le» «c5»for this issue of D.I.S.C, it's following:«»
«»
The cool «c2»intro «c5»was coded by no other than «c2»«l:articles/tricktrax»TrickTrax.«le» «c5»He also composed
the great tune and wrote the fitting text. The logo was pixeled by «c2»Unreal!«»
«»
«c5»As for the mag itself, the engine was developed and improved by
«c2»Cupid, «c5»giving us nothing else than an excellent working digital magazine.«»
The first title picture was greatly pixeled by «c2»Made, «c5»and the other
was excellently done by «c2»Beast. «c5»They gave us a warm welcome with their
piece of digital art.«»
«»
Our panel graphics displaying some beautiful visuals were drawn by «c2»Wade.
«c5»The headline cliparts were painted by «c2»Optic. «c5»The other cliparts were
mainly pixeled by «c2»Bridgeclaw «c5»and «c2»Alive «c5»(ex.Shade),
but also various others contributed. The backgrounds were nicely done by «c2»Bridgeclaw
«c5»(the face, man, wall and sign). The bad ones were done by Zerox and not used much.«»
«»
Some great musicians are responsible for the music in this issue. The
first module is called «c2»Sleep Well «c5»and was composed by «c2»«l:articles/dcs»Chromag«le» «c5»Module
number two was tracked by «c2»«l:articles/curtcool»CurtCool«le» «c5»which delievered it to us under the
name of «c2»«l:music/not_a_disc-oh_tune.tp3»Not A DISC-Oh Tune«le». «c5»It's a great diskmag module. The third module
was made by the professional musician «c2»«l:articles/sector»Marc«le» «c5»and called «c2»«l:music/secrets.tp3»Secrets.«le»«»
«»
«c5»When it comes to the editor team - the real «c2»D.I.S.C. Team, «c5»it's time to
introduce the new «c2»Main-Team «c5»of D.I.S.C.  «c2»Zerox «c5»has stepped down from being
the main-editor, and a main-team has been created instead. The idea is that
each and one of the members of this team, can organize and edit the text
of D.I.S.C. This time «c2»Zerox «c5»was responsible for the organizing and editing
(also refered to as the slave work), but next time another member might do
it. Anyway, the main-team consists of «c2»Darkhawk, 
«l:articles/ghandy»Ghandy«le», «l:articles/lordhelmet»Lord Helmet«le» and
Zerox.«»
«»
«c5»The D.I.S.C. Team also have an «c2»editor staff, «c5»which more or less will
support D.I.S.C. in each issue. The editors are; «c2»Zito, Punisher, Chris
and Sixpack. «c5»Sixpack was earlier supposed to be a member of the main-team,
and perhaps he will in future issues. As usual we have lots of «c2»guest
editors. «c5»In this issue the following persons contributed in one way or
another: «c2»Gone, Makke, Dreyer, Coach, The Hooligan, Splatterhead, Kure,
Lanch, Dipswitch, Slayer, Kfd, Marc, «l:articles/magic»Magic,«le» Krabob, Slummy,
Tricktrax, 
LoadError, Frequent, Cheetah, Zixaq, BlueBerry, Psycho, Booster, farfar,
Laika «c5»and probably some we can't remember right now.«»
«»
The news editor was «c2»Zerox, «c5»and the news agents were «c2»Punisher, Curt Cool,
Browalia and Kure.«»
«»
«c5»The advertisements editor was «c2»Zerox.«»
«»
«c5»We also have to THANK «c2»Curt Cool and the EC staff, Mod3m, The One, «c5»all
groups with homepages... ;) and the active sceners which makes it possible
to release such a big project. It really takes alot of very special
and talented sceners to put together a project like this. And the D.I.S.C.
Team want to thank those who created and sustained it. We also want to
inform you that the «c2»«l:articles/spreaders»official spreaders«le» «c5»of D.I.S.C. are: «c2»Adonis, Punisher
and Zito.«»
«»
«c5»In this issue we have some great articles. The most interesting sections
in D.I.S.C. are «c2»THE SCENE and ESCENTIAL. «c5»We have tried to cover the entire
history of the amiga and the scene so far, we have written about some of
the most interesting «c2»groups and persons, «c5»we have a «c2»competition, «c5»we have a 
prize, we have interviews, we have covered lots of parties, we have an
internet guide, we have «c2»reviews, «c5»the latest «c2»news, «c5»we share lots of
opinions, we have «c2»scene-reports, «c5»we have the empty minds section, the top
100 games list, lots of adverts for the swappers, entertainment and much much more.
We have some new sections and have removed a few of the old ones. The
Fantasy Corner will probably appear in ShowTime instead, and some of the
others may also reappear in the next issues of D.I.S.C.«»
«»
As D.I.S.C. is massive, it should be enjoyed as a good red wine... take
a sip now and then. Read a few articles now, and some later on. You'll
never know when the next issue appears. For us to be able to come up with
a great issue, the «c2»demo scene «c5»got to be active. To have an entire mag
filled with the usual editors about editors articles are boring. So we
depend on all of you out there to produce some «c2»great demos, intros,
slideshows, musicdisks in addition to mags. «c5»This year has begun with new
optimism as Amiga has launched their «c2»Amiga OS 3.9 «c5»late last year, and the
new «c2»AmigaOne «c5»card will soon arrive. And a few good productions have already
hit the scene this year. But we all have GREAT expectations towards the
«c2»Mekka-Symposium «c5»party which will be held this April. Lots of groups will
probably come up with something cool. The more releases the better. We have
to show everybody that the true Amiga scene is still «c2»ALIVE and KICKING!«»
«»
«c5»We expect that groups like «c2»Loonies, Potion, IRIS, Kangooroo,
Ephidrena, Haujobb,
Nah-Kolor, Void, Apathy, Mankind, Depth, Spaceballs, Whelpz,
DarkAge, Specter, Veezya, Contraz, Mawi, Appendix, HLA, Reason, Flopi,
Secretly, Nuance, Trinity, Nature «c5»and some others show up and release
something. Time will show if we are right. But at least we hope as many
as possible of the mentioned crews and other teams show up there.
«c2»The future «c5»of the amiga and the scene is very «c2»promising.«»
«»
«c5»With those words, we're ending this huge editorial. «c2»ENJOY «c5»our comeback
issue!«»
