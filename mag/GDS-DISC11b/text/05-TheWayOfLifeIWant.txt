«c2»And there is an  answer.  Against  all
odds  there  was  someone  reading the
articles in Apathy`s Feedback Issue#7,
a production  that  is  searching  its
competitor  in  the  whole scene these
days. Actually  this  is  a  reply  to
Strife`s  article  "What  kind of life
do we want?"  he released there,  so I
would  recommend  to  read this one at
first,  but it is not that neccessary.
All needed facts will be named here.«»
«»
At first I have to retort  that  there
exists a third kind of people and that
is me! No, I am only joking of  course
but I am going to become one of them.
I think instead of hanging around with
an ok-wife after a day at  an  8-hours
ok-job  or  just  making  money at the
stock market only all  the  time,  you
could  choose  a  more exciting way of
life:  Jump into that adventure!  That
is what I  expect  from  my  life.  No
accomplishments   through   money   or
watching  tv  by drinking some bottles
of the same bear  every  evening.  But
how  to  do  so  in this world that is
ruled by money and  money  makers.  It
is  not  possible  you  may say, but I
think it is.  Of course it will be not
an  easy  thing  to do, but it will be
worth to do something for...
To  explain  that,  I have to become a
bit personal, so don`t be frightened.«»

At first I gave up a "really"  serious
career at an advertising agency, threw
away  the chance for a lot of money, a
job  for  my  lifetime,  a  "standard"
 life. For some of you this may be THE
dream,  and I don`t want to offend you
with this article,  but  I could never
live this way. I want  to  realize  my
own ideas, my dream of life. I want to
try  out several  jobs  and  travel to
foreign  countries but stay here at my
place of birth the same time.In short:
I want to do everything I want to. You
may say this is impossible, I say `No`
because  I  started  this kind of life
already.«»
Only one  year  ago  I  dreamed  of  a
career  as author, but I had to notice
the  senselessness  of   this   dream,
although  it  was  more near to what I
generally want than everything before,
because you can neigther  really  make
money  nor  get  real fame with such a
job today. Especially not in  Germany,
where only the old and dead-since-ages
artists  are  respected.  But  I still
want  to  write  and  even call myself
author today.  And I am able to do so!
It will be no career, I know this now,
but I can make something out of it.  I
will  perhaps  write stories for small
magazines  only and get not much money
for  it  but  I will have a lot of fun
this  way.  And I am (already) editor.
In  scene.  And at this point I  don`t
have  the  same  opinion   as   Strife
explained in his article. It may be no
real  job  and  at  last  none you can
become rich  of,  the  same  thing  as
being   author,  but  as   I   already
mentioned it is what I want to do.
And  if  you  want to become happy and
get the life you  want,  you  have  to
follow  your  heart.  Your  wishes and
dreams. Just live.  How you manage the
rest is another question.«»
«»
And of course I give you the answer or
at least I try to explain  the  answer
for  me:  In  real life I already made
some experiences with several jobs for
example.  I cleaned trains, was night-
watcher, secretary & editor and at the
moment   I   have   to   work   in  an
advertising agency for some weeks yet,
because I had to quit this job  before
I  go  mad.  Although I never believed
that sentence when I  was  young,  you
can really find a job for your  living
at  any  time.  If  you  are  not  too
arrogant or ignorant you  will  always
find a way to come through. And mainly
you will be able to live the life  you
want. Do art. Do fun. Do life.«»
«»
And  how  will   my   personal   story
continue?  I don`t know exactly, but I
know how it will NOT continue:
No  8-hours  ok-job  and  drinking the
same bear in front of the tv set every
evening. For an ok-wife it is  in  any
case too late because I already got an
extraordinary and crazy artist-girl.
In  2001  I  planed to study. At first
translation,  because I want to know a
lot of languages, then philosophy. And
later I will spend some years in other
countries for more than  three  months
each,  as I did two years ago in Paris
- the  town  I  love  as  I  love   my
hometown - where I  will  surely  stay
for a while again  some  time.  And  I
will  come  back  home. I will stay in
scene as long as possible.  But I want
to  make  the  best  with my real life
too.«»
May I die young or old,  I always want
to  know  that I did the best with the
time  I  was  given.  The  world is my
place, isn`t it?«»
«»
At  last  you see Strife`s article was
not only a filler - as  he  declared -
but an inspiration. At least for me.
Of  course I have no guaranties for my
plans  but  that  again  who does? You
will never find out if you don`t try.
Perhaps both of our articles, Strife`s
and  mine,  made  some  of  you,  dear
readers,  think  about your situation.
If not, it may be your fault.«»
