«c1»*** IT'S TIME FOR...  NEW CHART CATEGORIES!!! ***«»
«as»«»
«c3»BY ZEROX/GODS«»
«»
«c2»From the beginning of mankind humans have always competed. At first
we competed because it was necesarry for surviving, later on we have
done it because it's «c5»fun «c2»and because we can gain «c5»prestige, fame and
money «c2»out of it. Well... from the early days of the amiga scene there
have been charts, so that we all can set some goals in our time here,
and we get some famous people like in all other communities. It's a
great feeling being voted the best or actually find your name on any
chart many sceners believe. But isn't it time for «c5»new categories?
«c2»Categories that are more up to date and that really mean something
special to the winners.... It's time to bring back the FUN and perhaps
get rid of the old charts in D.I.S.C, The Official Eurocharts, ShowTime,
and the other charts around. I've had the privilege to make
a lot of new chart categories which I feel represent the scene.«»
«»
«c5»Here they are:«»
«»
«c6»BEST SOURCE-RIPPER:«»
«»
«c1»According to many coders these days other coders ripp their sources
or simply use sources given to them or found on internet.
Yes, other coders aren't as good as them and find an easy way to get a good
result.«»
«»
«c6»BEST SCANNER:«»
«»
«c1»Some graphicians have always accused other graphicians for scanning, at
least when they loose a competition. To bring back the fair competitions
and to get better pictures I suggest to allow scanning in competitions
for all graphicians worldwide.«»
«»
«c6»BEST SAMPLE-RIPPER:«»
«»
«c1»All the time musicians claim that other musicians steal their superior
samples. It's time to give the best sample-ripper credits for his work
I think.«»
«»
«»
«»
«c6»BEST SCENE-SLAVE:«»
«»
«c1»Some sceners are claiming that they've been the slaves of other sceners
and of course done a lot of work without getting credits and the respect
they should have. In my opinion it's really about time giving them the
appreciation they deserve with launching this new chart category.«»
«»
«c6»BEST PACKER:«»
«»
«c1»Yes, I really feel it's time to make a comeback for this category. In
earlier days everybody where making packs, copying packs etc. Many packs sure
looked alike. Anyway, these days I think packers are more like endangered
spices - almost extincted! If a packer manages to find intros in between parties
and release a pack these days he sure got to be special, and therefore
deserves his name on the charts. The same goes for swappers...  You people
who have suggested to remove this category think again! There aren't many
swappers left, and I think all of them should be on the top 10 list so
we know who they are. It's better to remove the advertisements from these
10 last swappers in the scene instead. Everybody probably have had their
addresses for years.«»
«»
«c6»BEST WARS:«»
«»
«c1»A prize should be given to the ones that create the most interesting
scene wars, or the ones that are the best mud-throwers. I hereby declare
that I'm one of the highly respected candidates for this prestigious chart.«»
«»
«c6»BEST LIVING LEGENDS:«»
«»
«c1»We have many legends in the scene, but who's still alive? It's seems like
most of them are inactive or don't have the power to make anything decent
anylonger.«»
«»
«c6»BEST AMIGA #AMIGASCNE CHATTER«»
«»
«c1»Some people are always chatting at #amigascne nomatter what time it is,
but it's actually hard to find many real amiga sceners at #amigascne these
days. Most of the time this channel is dominated by PC sceners that have
been a part of the amiga community some time ago. So I think we should get
a new chart with the best amiga chatters at #amigascne.«»
«»
«c6»BEST CODERS ANIMATION:«»
«»
«c1»Coders are instantly accusing other coders for making animations or
raytraced animations for their demos. If a coder is good in making
animations, it's time to give him the credits in this new chart.«»
«»
«c6»BEST PRISONER:«»
«»
«c1»It seems like many sceners have some problems with the police. It
doesn't matter if it's because of faking stamps, running illegal boards,
violence or other activities...  but how long time they have to spend
in prison. The longer time they have to do in prison, the higher
position they should get on the charts.«»
«»
«c6»BEST AMIGA PARTY:«»
«»
«c1»These days all the big amiga parties that started so many years ago, like
The Party, Gathering and Assembly are totally dominated by people using PC.
So I hereby announce that we should get a new chart for the best amiga
parties around... if there are many pure amiga parties and if the competition
to get the highest ranking will be hard, I don't know.«»
«»
«c6»BEST SECRET PART:«»
«»
«c1»In many demos there are secret parts that the ordinary scener never gets
to watch. In order to get rid of this problem I suggest that all groups
that have made demos with secret parts arrange a party with only one
BIG competition - The secret part compo. It doesn't matter if the demo
is new or old, every entry is accepted. As the secret parts get known
we can make our own chart for them.«»
«»
«»
«c2»Ok, this was only a few of my favourite new scene categories. Surprise
me with new categories in the next issues of all the mags in the scene.
Yes... here's something to think about all you makers of diskmags today.
What do you say Curt Cool? Zito? Darkus?«»
