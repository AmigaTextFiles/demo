«c2»*** DANISH SCENE-REPORT ***«»

«c3»BY ZEROX/GODS«»
«»«as»
«c1»Last time I wrote a Danish scene report was over 5 and a half years
ago, and then I mentioned 57 Danish groups! The scene was very active
with many good crews, like Balance, Polka Brothers, The Silents, Passion, Disaster
and Impact to mention a few. The times have changed, and today there are
perhaps 50 sceners left. I'm NOT going to mention all the
groups that have died during these years, but instead concentrate on the
familiar groups the latest time. The information below is probably not 100%
correct, so please send your information to correct me and update me.«»

«c6»CROMATICS:«»
«»
«c1»- The "new" Cromatics released a couple of productions, and Dansktoppen
was one of them. It was made in cooperation with Unique! They also arranged
the party TRSAC, but died short afterwards.«»

«c6»COPY&PASTE PRODUCTIONS:«»
«»
«c1»-They first came to my attention at the Scene Meeting'99 when they released
an intro which came second. After that I can't say I've seen or heard anything from them.«»

«c6»DEPTH:«»
«»
«c1»- The group got founded back in 1993 and most people know them because they
took over the EuroChart from Static Bytes, and have impressed by releasing
issue 28 to 41. The latest in cooperation with IRIS. They also have members
in Finland, Norway, Sweden and England. They are known to do some crazy things
now and then. The member Curt Cool has started an ambitious project to gather
all scene-modules and composers in a BIG archive by the way. Help him!
The latest news is that Kollaps is no longer a member.«»

«c6»DEQUE:«»
«»
«c1»-This is another fun-group which appeared at The Scene Meeting 2000 with the
mindblasting intro Pickles, hehe.
Nothing much to say about the group, just that it consists of some other members
in a group beginning of D.... ;)«»
«»
«c6»EFREET:«»
«»
«c1»-A small group which you don't hear from too often. But when you do, you know it's good.
The intro Deep Pan for instance had lots of good routines and a good precalculation of music.
The most famous member got to be the coder-wizard BlueBerry which is a double-member as he's
also in Loonies. They are often seen at the Danish parties.«»

«c6»FOCUS DESIGN:«»
«»
«c1»-They arranged the South-Sealand party-series, and released some good intros.
Last production I saw from them was the intro for EC 39. It seems like Optima
has rejoined from Scoopex, perhaps as double-member?«»

«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Corial and Optima«»

«c6»GUNNARS FARVEBIO:«»
«»
«c1»- This is a group which has existed for a very long time (perhaps the oldest
danish group that can be considered to be alive or...?). At least the group
got founded back in 1991, and have released many funny productions ever since.
The codework always seem to be good. The last time I saw something from them
was at the Scene Meeting'99. The first time I also noticed a bug in the code,
hehe. They are reported to be working on something, perhaps for MS?«»

«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Kollaps aka various handles and Dr.Who.«»
«»
«c6»IRIS:«»
«»
«c1»- This is one of the oldest groups in the scene today. They have been very
active the latest years and released many quality productions. IRIS members
usually also attend many parties, and arrange the Scene Meeting themselves.
In addition to the Danish members, they have a few members in countries such
as Poland, Spain, Sweden and Norway.
They are releasing the EuroChart in cooperation with Depth nowadays, and will soon
become a coop partner in another old mag. IRIS got to be one of the leading
danish crews and can also be considered to be a good group in international standard.
The latest release in addition to the DISC intro, is the demo Abecedarian released
at TRSAC2 and the oldschool intro Vivid released at Christmas.«»

«c6»LOONIES:«»
«»
«c1»- This was a group which got founded 6 years ago, and now has achieved to become
one of the very best groups at the scene. Especially the latest demos and a certain
musicdisk have got attention.
They are known to have some weird-style or deal with themes
in their productions, and are also present at most parties. I think all members
are from Denmark. They have also been very active lately, and won both the SM party and MS party
last year
with Cybercinematastic and Arla, in addition to the TRSAC2 with At The Movies demo.
Now they have taken over Dansktoppen which will become Scantoppen?!! Watch
out for them at Mekka-Symposium!«»

«c6»SCOOPEX:«»
«»
«c1»- Optima is said to have rejoined Focus Design. Boogeyman left the scene.
I don't know if there are any other members left or if they have released
anything. Perhaps Optima is a double-member? Or with his Megademo 2000 for
Haujobb he might have joined them? I surely don't know!«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Decoy? Optima?«»
«»
«c6»SPOON:«»
«»
«c1»- This is a group which got founded around early 1993 I think under the name
Transonic, but fast renamed to Spoon. On Amiga it had its best days around
1994/95 with a few intro releases and their Sound musicdisk. After Christine
De La Queen left the scene, the group hasn't got so much attention. The
group is very small nowadays with 2-3 members I think, and the coder
Shayera is making most PC productions now I guess.«»

They are reported to be DEAD now anyway.«»

faded away, is unknown to me.«»
