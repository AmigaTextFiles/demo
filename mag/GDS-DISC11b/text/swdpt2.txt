«c2»<SWD\Polka> Melomaniac is such a dictator!«»
<SWD\Polka> He kicked me from #amigascne cos he doesn`t like me.«»
<THG^DCS>   yep...thats the reason alright«»
<SWD\Polka> The Amiga scene is so fucked up! You do something to contribute and you get called lame. You sit on IRC all night every night and you're elite?!«»
<Seffren>   hehe«»
<Seffren>   maybe release for your own groups next time? :)«»
<Rigel_>    SWD\Polka: welcome to reality.«»
<SWD\Polka> Seffren: Oh yeh, cos TRSI are too elite to release anything of their own.«»
<THG^DCS>   swd, so you decided to help them a bit?«»
<SWD\Polka> rigel: reality suxx don't it?«»
<Rigel_>    SWD\Polka: sometimes, you know.«»
<THG^DCS>   swd, so, when will we see the next release from Polka Bros. anytime soon i hope?«»
<SWD\Polka> Just gets to me. This is why the scene is dead. Cos the elite do f'all«»
<Seffren>   SWD\Polka <SWD\Polka> Seffren: Oh yeh, cos TRSI are too elite to release anything of their own.«»
