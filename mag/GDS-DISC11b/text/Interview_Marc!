«al»«»
«c3»BY ZEROX/GODS«»
«as»«»
«c1»Marc has been one of the most active musicians the latest years and one of the most
popular ones too. He has done quite good in music competitions and actually won at
some parties. Marc is also one of the most played magmusicans the latest years with modules
in almost every mag. These days he is very busy with commercial projects and have
already got some success. Therefore it was a great pleasure to interview this talented musician.«»
«»
To find out more about his latest commercial projects and his thoughts about the scene,
read on!!!«»
«c2»Hello Marc and welcome to the D.I.S.C. building. Take a seat and lets
begin this first Amiga interview with you :)«»
«»
Can you tell the D.I.S.C.readers about your first contact with the scene?«»
«»
«c5»The first contact with the scene i had in 1995 on the nexus party`95.
It was my first party and i think it was the first contact with the
german amiga scene.At this party i meet my first swapping contact
Cyborg/Crazy and his friend Thcm and also Jazz/Haujobb.
After the party we (CDK,JCS,NoName and me) had also a little con-
versation with Jazz and some of the other scene people (like Chaos
who released there together with Tron their Mainzelmaenchen Demo).«»
«»
But this was only the first contact with the scene people,my first
contact with amigas etc. was at JCS place who was the first who had
an amiga 500 in our town.
After playing Turrican together with JCS i was very astonished and
i wanted to buy myself also such a great computer.«»
«»
«c2»What do you find so facinating with the scene?«»
«»
«c5»The most fascinating thing in the scene are the demos and for myself
it were also the musicians who fascinate me.
It was really fascinating to make music with this computer.«»
«»
«c2»When did you decide to start composing and what was your very first
module? By the way, has it been released? Which was the first module
used in a production?«»
«»
«c5»I decided to compose modules in the end of the year 1993.
My really first module called "An der Front" and it was a module
build up with ripped samples from the game Battle Isle by Blue
Byte. There were only some SFX like bombs and screaming people :)«»
«»
My first module which was used in a production was a module i can`t
remember now the name, which was included in "Bato" a slideshow like
production which was developed by JCS,CDK and me in the year 1994.«»
«»
My first discmag module which was used was "funky elements" which
was used in R.O.M iussue 6.«»
«»
«c2»What's your favourite own made module?«»
«»
«c5»My favourite own made module is "sensuous whisper","holidays in march"
and "sax`n`summer".«»
«»
«c2»What's your favourite module made by others?«»
«»
«c5»Of course "guitar slinger" by jogeir and "stairways" and
"the jungle theme" by chromag. i also love the modules from chorus
and sid and radix`s "paul the kinder penguine"1&2 and "Tilbury Fair".
When the heavens fall from Purple Motion,and Nobody dreaming
from Dune...«»
«»
«c2»Do you use only selfmade samples or borrow from others?«»
«»
«c5»I use both, samples from myself and samples from other musicians
but i try mostly to use only my own ones.«»
«»
«c2»Where do take your samples from?«»
«»
«c5»I take my samples from special sample cds ,from ordinary music cds
and from my own midi equipment (synthesizer,sampler,drumcomputer etc.)
...and of course from modules from other artists.«»
«»
«c2»How do you start when composing a new tune? Do you start experimenting
with your synth, or do you first get a vage melody in your head which
you want to realize? And do you use this main melody and bring other
instruments and background themes afterwards?«»
«»
«c5»At first i search for some string accords and then i build up the
whole song.but sometimes i get a cool sample or a sequence and then
i try to make something with it.
it`s always different,i have no special way in making a module.
especially making a guitar module is sometimes very special.«»
«»
«c2»The module 'Sometimes again' could be described as your breakthrough in the
scene. How long time did you spend on finishing it? And how long time do
you usually spend on making a normal module?«»
«»
«c5»It takes a month or so to finish it but normally the whole song
is composed on a weekend. Mostly i started a module on the friday
afternoon and then i finish it on the next two weekend days. but
sometimes i have no idea how to finish the mod and then it lays
months unfinished on my hd.«»
«»
«c2»Are there any other composers that influence your music, and in that
case which ones? Which are your favourite module/chiptune composers?«»
«»
«c5»Chromag and Jogeir are the composers who have influenced me a
lot. I wanted always to make such great modules jogeir has done
but at the very beginning the modules were too difficult for me
too much unknown commands and so on.«»
«»
My favourite Module composers are :Chromag,Jogeir,Radix,Coma,
Chorus & Sid ,Yolk & Legend,Muffler,Poldi,Scorpik,Vocal,Scortia,
Clawz,Dizzy,Dime,Lizardking,Nuke (Spaceman),Pink,Geir Tjelta,Dune,
Purple Motion,Slide,Strobo,Iso,Substance.«»
«»
«c2»If you forget about your computer for a minute and grab a CD from your
collection, which one would it be and why? Which 'real' music styles and
composers do you enjoy the most?«»
«»
«c5»I would like to grab out the "Goa Raeume Vol.2" CD which is now
my favourite Goa CD but i like all kinds of music.
I`m also a great fan of Chris Huelsbeck ,Jean Micheal Jarre,Us3,
The brand new heavies,Hans Zimmer,Vangelis,The Prodigy,LTJ Bukem...
It could also be the compilation "earth vol.2" from Ltj Bukem which
is also a very good drum`n`bass cd. but not the ordinary d&b.here
it`s not only drum and bass there are cool jazzy,funky elements in
the music which are making this kind of music more interesting.«»
«»
«c2»Many scene musicians have played other instruments before they joined
the scene, have you?«»
«»
«c5»I have never played any instruments before.I have only "played" with
my mums Bontempi Keyboard some times before i get my own amiga.
i have learned everything by listening and analysing other modules.«»
«»
«c2»Are you sitting comfortable? Do you want a break? Can I get you anything
to drink?«»
«»
«c5»No,please continue the interview i`m out of time...
...i have to finish several tunes for discmags.:)«»
«»
«c2»Oh yes, I forgot... you are a very busy man these days. In any case, the
D.I.S.C. staff is very poor at the moment, so it saves us some money also.
Thanks.«»
«»
Now it's time to get to know you a bit better... so here's a bunch of
questions :)«»
«»
In 1994 you and CDK started Sonority productions - a label for your
commercial project. Please tell the readers a bit more about it.
Are you getting cash out of it?«»
«»
«c5»To say it clear: We haven`t got any money out of our hobby.
It`s the fun we are making music not the money,but we hope
we will get some money sometimes.«»
«»
«c2»The competition 'made in schaumburg' led to you, cdk and your female
singer Marianne and two dancers performed a live act in front of
1500 people for the very first time at the Mega school's out party
last summer. How was that experience and what other bands performed
there?«»
«»
«c5»It was a great experience with lots of fun for us!
Other bands who have played there were "Heath Hunter and "Red 5".
The audience consisted in the whole of 12-19 years old girls :)«»
«»
«c2»He he he...  I can understand you had a great time :)«»
«»
Your song 'Land Of Dreams' was included on a CD and available for sale.
Please tell more about that and where we can get the CD?«»
«»
«c5»The tilte "Land of dreams" has nothing in common with the same named
module which was included in Seenpoint 06!
We only used the same name for our first rave-pop tune.
It was our first real Midi track we`ve composed together using my
synthie and our two Amigas.We connected our both Computers and so we
could use 8 Channels for our music.It was really funny and interesting.«»
«»
«c2»What are your future plans? Continue with this real-music group,
make commercial music, join a game-company or what?«»
«»
«c5»Yes, I want to make commercial music because i need the money -who need
nothing? I don`t think that a game company would engaged me, maybe only
some smaller Amiga companies but there aren`t so much these days.«»
«»
We (CDK and me) produced our first own cd together. It was
named "abi`98 the theme", this cd was for our school mates as a
memory cd.but on this cd there was also included our "land of
dreams" track and three others.«»
«»
Lately I have produced a lot new music and had also some releases:«»
«»
My first real record was released under the project name "Electric Division" and
it was called "Acid Injection". It was released by the Munich Record Label
"Manic Records" and was distributed by "Cosmophilia" in Germany,England and
France.«»
«»
My second release i had under the project name "Sonority" on the Bonn Music
Label "Power Vinyl Records" it was distributed by  "Music Mail".«»
«»
My 3rd record was released again, by the "Manic Records" Label under the
project name "Electric Division" the record was named "Helium Crunch".«»
«»
My 4th record will be out at the end of this year, under the project name
"Electric Division" the record will be named "Mantronik" and be released by
the Label "Simantik".«»
«»
I have also released a track on the love parade sampler "Parade of Hearts"
which was released at the "Love Parade 2000" in Berlin this year.«»
Also a b-side trance track got out at the end of 2000. I produced this
one for a new record of DJ Panic.«»

«»

«»
I`m now working on the 3rd Electric Division CD-Album, which will be out on
peoplesound.com in 2001!«»
«»
By the way, my best friend JCS is also the offical "Electric Division"
graphician who design`s all cd covers.. and also made the "ED Homepage".«»
«»
«c2»You have made music for several mags... I can mention Rage!, The Jungle, ROM, 
The EuroChart and there are several other well known mags with your
music. Why do you make music for mags? And do you have the complete
oversight over all the mags you have participated in?«»
«»
«c5»I started as a normal musician who was in a newcomer group but there
wasn`t a real coder and after NoName joined us he wasn`t so active
so we couldn`t produced so much demos,intros etc. So what a pitty for
a musician who can compose several modules a week. So i searched for
a way in which my modules could be released. And as there was no other
group who was in need of a musician i started to support discmags with
my work.«»
«»
I have of course the complete oversight over my 12 mods which were
included in the different mags.
For all interested people here are a list with all my used discmag
modules...«»

«»
And for different packmags (like budgie, case78 etc.)  
...but who cares?«»
«as»«»
«»
«c2»As we can see, most sceners have heard your music in one way or another... so
it wasn't a bad choice to publish your modules in diskmags.«»
«»
Do you have any projects on the Amiga? Music-disk or other productions
and/or will you take part in more competitions at computer events? «»
«»
«c5»There are no plans because i have not so much time yet.
Maybe the first Amiga 8 Channel Musicdisk...«»
«»
«c2»What do you think about the following musicians:«»
«al»«»
«c4»Chromag:«»
«»
«c5»One of the best Amiga musicians who made the best discmag mods!«»
«»
«c4»Dizzy:«»
«»
«c5»I love his "banana split" and also most of his other mods.«»
«»
«c4»Dune:«»
«»
«c5»A very talented musician.The only one who makes some `other` styled
music. He has to be on the top of every chart!«»
«»
«c4»Dreamer:«»
«»
«c5»Hmmm,i don`t know why he is so high ranked in the charts but
his module "doclandia" was his best.most others are really strange
and not very good.«»
«»
«c4»Heatbeat:«»
«»
«c5»He made lots of modules,one of the bests are the ones which were
included in the game Elfmania. Also his jazz styled modules are
cool.«»
«»
«c4»Jogeir:«»
«»
«c5»The best!! On Amiga and now on PC! His new multichannel mods are
great and his older ones are evergreens for me.«»
«»
«c4»Moby:«»
«»
«c5»He has made three good modules (the ones from Arte) and that`s it!
I don´t know so much others from him, his simpsons theme was also very
good but deserves this a livetime stay in the charts??«»
«»
«c4»Xtd:«»
«»
«c5»He has made lots of modules but i like mostly his cool chiptunes.«»
«»
«»
«c4»Virgill:«»
«»
«c5»He has ripped my samples from my TP95 module "too much" , changed
them a little bit with SAM a sample calculator program and used them
in his second tune for the demo "the gate". after asking him why he
has ripped the whole guitar samples he said he hasn`t but all my
contacts said that the samples are from my module and agreed with me
that Virgill has ripped them.«»
«»
But to be fair i have to say that he has composed some very good
tunes.I like mostly his older tunes (f.e.interference end)
more than his newer ones (f.e. genmanipulation).
But he copies himself very often. Some will say it`s his style.«»
«»
[Do you know that the "Entity" samples were taken from the film
soundtrack cd "true lies"?!]«»
«as»
«c2»In an unpublished interview which Virgill made for D.I.S.C. some years ago,
he commented about his modules and mentioned Entity:«»
«»
«c6»"I start hating most of my modules when listening to them too often. And this 
happens if they are older than 2 months.  I only like my new ones. At the moment 
this is 'Entity' and 'Nosehole'. But the  best style in some of my old Music is: 
'Save my Dick' or 'I stay with my Mother'!".«»
«»
«c2»If Virgill had updated the interview, you dear reader, could have read it all!
Anyway, lets continue with the Marc interview! ;)«»
«»
Now with all your music projects and education, will you continue your
scene career?«»
«»
«c5»No, i`m out of the scene since 1998/99.. my last mods I had made for the
Haujobb winner demo "Memonics" which won the first price at the Mekka
Symposium 1999.«»
«»
I`m now selling my Amiga and will concentrate on my music career and my
future as an informatik assistent.. maybe i will work in the future for an
online music label like peoplesound.com, besonic, etc. ...«»
«»
Of course i will never forget the good times i had with my Amiga and
with all my contacts which i got through all these five years! Most of them
came by the way from poland!!!«»
«»
I`m every year at the Symposium^Mekka Party here in Fallingbostel (Germany)
.. so if somebody want to `catch` me - you`ll find me there.«»
«»
If there are interested people who want some marc mods they have to contact
Aztec/Absurd^Sector 7... he has all my over 200 mods!! Also in the Aminet
you`ll find some marc mods : Aminet/mods/sonor«»
«c2»What was your motivation and reason to stay at the scene?«»
«»
«c5»Nowdays there are not so much motivation left,i have made my modules
because i liked to make music but I've stopped to make it because
i'm now busy with educucation and `real` music (midi).«»
«»
«c2»Do you have any knowledge of the PC scene and would you consider
joining it?«»
«»
«c5»I don`t know the PC scene so much but there are lots of talented
persons who made great demos!! But i don`t know if i would join
these scene. But never say never.«»
«»
«al»«»
«»
«»
«c2»What is your favourite:«»
«»
«c4»Musician: «c6»Jogeir, Chromag«»
«»
«c4»Graphician: «c6»JCS :) ,Lazur,Nero«»
«»
«c4»Coder: «c6»NoName :),Touchstone«»
«»
«c4»Editor: «c6»Mop«»
«»
«c4»Group: «c6»TBL«»
«»
«c4»Demo: «c6»Captured Dreams«»
«»
«c4»Music-disk: «c6»Crossroads«»
«»
«c4»Slideshow: «c6»Wild«»
«»
«c4»Diskmag: «c6»R.O.M«»
«»
«as»«»
«c2»What was the last good demo you saw? What was the last music-disk
you heard and the last diskmag you read?«»
«»
«c5»The last good demo i saw was "Dose" from Mellow Chips a really great demo.
The last musicdisk i heard was Virgill Dreams and it wasn`t a pleasure!
The last discmag I read was Seenpoint which was very good.«»
«»
«c2»Can you tell me about your group Haujobb? Productions & People.
For instance, what do you think of the musicians Cdk, Jazz
and Muffler and their styles?«»
«»
«c5»I don`t know what i can tell you about Haujobb because im not so "in"
the group.
Muffler is a very young and talented musician who should storm the
charts. Jazz has made lots of good chiptunes and a higher rank in
the charts would be better for him. CDK is a good friend of mine
who doesn`t make so much modules but the ones he has done are good.«»
«»
«c2»Does it mean anything special for you to see your name at any chart,
and if so, why?«»
«»
«c5»It doesn`t mean something special for me to see my name at any chart.
I have released over 130 Modules by now and nobody has react so i`m
not interested any more to see my name at any chart.
The charts are the most boring things i know - everytime the same names
the same people the same demos, not very well updated.«»
«al»«»
«c2»Describe the future of the Amiga;«»
«»
«c4»OPTIMISTIC: «c6»If the ppc cards are coming there will be a future,without
            too, but only for the hardcore freaks.«»
«»
«c4»REALISTIC: «c6»There is no future for the amiga,only for the scene.«»
«»
«c4»PESIMISTIC: «c6»In some years there are sitting only some hundred amiga
  freaks together and call them `the scene`.More will left
  to the PC maybe i`m too. Multichannel ,24Bit, 1000 MHZ - should i say more ?!?«»
«as»«»
«»
«c2»Do you have other hobbies beside the music? What do you do in your
spare time? And what are you doing normally? Studies? Job?«»
«»
«c5»I`m an ordinary ,average student who`s studying as informatic assistent.
There isn`t so much freetime beside my `main` hobby: music.«»
«»
«c2»After this pretty big interview I think the entire scene have learned
to know you a bit better.
And now last, I would like to thank you for answering all these questions
for the exclusive pleasure of the D.I.S.C. readers. Now you can write
whatever you want... greet friends or whatever. The keys are yours... :)«»
«»
«c5»I want to please the discmag coders to give OctamedSoundstudio Modules
a chance to be included into the next iussues of their mag.
Give newcomers a chance and don`t be arrogant!! Nobody is the best,
we were all born as copies!«»
«»
«»
«al»«»
and don`t forget ...«»
«ac»«»                                «c6»life without sound is poor!«»

«»
«c7»To the reader: I apologize that some parts of this interview seem to be a bit
old, as we only managed to update the main-parts.«»
