«c6»D.I.S.C. - Digital Information Service for Computerfreaks.«»
«»
«c1»The D.I.S.C. project got started in the middle of 1989 by a bunch of
dedicated sceners often refered to as the 'salad team'. The intention
was to 'make a mag for every computer-freak, not just those who
think to be great', as the creators told us. Now, 12 years later we
can surely say the creators succeeded.«»
«»
«c4»ISSUE 1«»
«»
«c1»The first issue got released the 10/1-90 after an internal meeting held
the 3-7th of January. The unique thing about D.I.S.C. was that the mag
got created by so many different people and groups. D.I.S.C. didn't have
one main-editor nor one group behind the production, and this was actually
the strength of this legendary diskmag. Of course some persons were more
important than others and were working very hard to keep this team together.
«»
The first issue included 31 articles about all kind of subjects from the
usual virus talks, coding & graphics matters, copy parties, interviews,
lamer stories, scene-reports, stories about the post, fantasy stories,
role-playing, demo corner etc. It was fun reading and experiencing D.I.S.C.
The 'design' was very simple and made by Cougar (then in Phase 101). It
was just a D.I.S.C. logo at the top and not much more. The code was done
by MCS/Level 4... it was a selector looking like one of the usual pack
selectors with a scrolltext at the bottom. The music was performed by
Timetraveller, and the scrollfont was made by CMR/Level 4.
«»
The most important thing about a mag is always the articles though, and
they were created by JPN/Level 4, Torch, SF/United Forces, Arcadia/
Fantasy Force, Elf/Level 4, Fader 5/Scoopex, Prince/Phase 101, Whitesnake/
Critters, MIB/Level 4, Crain and Mr.T/Introspective. Main-editing teams
were of course Phase 101 and Level 4. Not a big team in the beginning, but
they made a promising start of an intersting project. The FUN had started.«»
«»
«c4»ISSUE 2«»
«»
«c1»Only a few months after the release of issue 1, the next issue got out.
In March a pretty big mag was presented to the scene with 111 articles
filled with fun. Both the code by MCS/Level 4 and the gfx by Cougar/Level 4
were slightly improved. This time the music was composed by Titan. The scrollfont
was still made by CMR/Level 4 and now the menu font was done by Dr.C/TCC/RSI.
D.I.S.C. presented now also comix, and the first ones were made by Cleric.«»
«»
In this issue we surely got the feeling that the D.I.S.C. team was very
strong and that JPN and Torch were the key persons behind it. Other persons
and groups involved in this issue were Pincher/Phase 101, Snoopy/Level 4.asd,
The Exorcist/Sanction, The Fantasy Force, The Inter Force, Tsy 9001/Tristar,
Yannic/Level 4 asd, MMS/Level 4 asd, Rictor & Slayer/TSB, Australian Crackers
United, Duck-Power, Mip, 6502 and Hit/Level 4-asd.«»
«»
D.I.S.C. was beginning to get a certain form, and special corners. In issue
2 the articles were about coding-matters, scene-reports, discussions,
reviews, equipment, lamer stories, gfx-matters, feedback, chatterbox, demo
corners and demo charts, diskstealer stuff and more. It was infact very
good and funny to read. As always some cool sources were included on the
disk also. You could have plenty of fun with D.I.S.C.«»
«»
«c4»ISSUE 3«»
«»
«c1»In June D.I.S.C. 3 got released. Once again the code and gfx were a bit
improved. As for the gfx... in each issue something was added. In issue
2 one figure beside the D.I.S.C. logo at the top and in issue 3 another
figure on the other side. A cool song was presented by Keo/Fraxion, I
think many sceners will recognize this one. This time the comix were done
by Arcadia... except from that, it was the same persons behind the rest.«»
«»
D.I.S.C. 3 was not as big as the previous issue, but contained 54 articles.
All articles and news from Torch were missing. The others were a bit angry
about that. The Maltese post couldn't take the blame they claimed. In any
case, this issue included much about the same as in the other issues. It
had demo corners, charts, stories, interviews, gfx-matters, music stuff
and more.«»
«»
Some new and very important persons joined the D.I.S.C. Team in this issue.
And one of them is the reason why you're reading issue 11 of D.I.S.C. right
now. Yes, Chris/IRIS joined and the same did Yankee from the Zine staff.
The 'main-editors' were Yankee, JPN, Arcadia (and Torch). Other sceners
involved were Mark/Subway, Mic/Level 4-asd, Cmr/Level 4-asd, MCS & MMS/Level 4-asd,
Snoopy/Level 4-asd, The Special Brothers, David Lightman, Maverick, Firewolf/
Desaster Area and Stormbringer/Fantasy Force.«»
«»
«c4»ISSUE 4«»
«»
«c1»The D.I.S.C. Team were working a lot and in August they presented issue 4.
Now we knew that D.I.S.C. had come to stay as an important mag way into
the future.«»
«»
The code was once again improved. A fastloader had been coded by Mic/Level 4,
and a crunchroutine by JPN/Level 4. A new menu font had been added by
Whitestar/Level 4. This time the comix got presented by Possesed. The music
was done by Jochen Hippel. The rest was done by the usual sceners.«»
«»
Torch was definately out of the D.I.S.C. Team as he started a paper mag
instead. Main editors were Yankee, Jpn, Pincher, Arcadia, Ken. The teams were
Addonic, Level 4 and Phase 101 with Pincher I guess.«» 
«»
D.I.S.C  was very big with 61 articles and 160 pages of fun. As always sources
were included on the disk together with the funny start text also.«»
«»
Comix were made, it got written interviews, scene-stories, news, party-
reports, gfx-course, equipment, faking articles, chatterbox, demo corner
and demo charts, scene-reports etc. The reviews were very good with happy
face values and more. D.I.S.C had also gotten known for their use of colours
and blitz.«»
«»
The team had grown pretty big and a lot were writing for D.I.S.C. The following
persons contributed in issue 4 in addition to those already mentioned:«»
«»
Chris/IRIS, Paradigm/Addonic, Crazy/Pantheon Softwork, Tno/Lacus Inc, Cyborgs,
Cmo/Level 4, Duke/Level 4, Codelight/IRIS, Snoopy/Level 4, Lasur/Abakus,
Watchman/Complex, Wizard/Crionics, 6502 Hit/Level 4, Whitestar/Level 4,
Cinclart/Desaster Area, Tronix, Zodiak/Cult, Munster/Spreadpoint, Ytark,
Ken L. Nays, Marc/Abakus, Zodiac/Success and more.«»
«»
«c4»ISSUE 5«»
«»
«c1»Only eight months after D.I.S.C. 1, issue 5 got out in October/November.
This issue contains 62 articles and 192 pages including party-reports,
game-tips, coder-hints, assembler course, painting-tricks, hardware-tips,
music-composing, interviews, comix, friendship articles,
disksteal corner, about games, roleplaying articles, news, chatterbox, 
diskmag reviews and more. It had something for everyone.«»
«»
IRIS had started to get major influence as many of its members participated
in the project, just like the Level 4 members. The main-editing teams
were now Addonic, Dynamix, IRIS and Level 4-asd. 'Main-editors' were Yankee,
Pincher, Flinx, Ken, Crazy, Jpn, Chris and Keo.«»
«»
As usual many were writing for D.I.S.C. Some of them were Ecs/Crusaders,
Firecode/Amaze, Swapperjack/Doom, Tcb/Pussy, Zodiac/Sidon, Maduano/Istari,
Geronymo/Sun Connection, Sabbel, Codelight/Defeat, Pincher/Phase 101,
Slash/Mega Powers, Headbanger/Artech, Chris/IRIS, D.Traumer/IRIS, CMR/Level 4,
Biobab/IRIS, Ktulu/IRIS, Cooper/Dynamix, Luc de Maroy/IRIS, Flinx/Fantasy
Force (ex.Stormbringer), Keo/Fraxion, Paradigm/Addonic, Yankee/Addonic,
Atl/Level 4, Crazy/Pantheon Softwork, Moonwalker/Dynamix, Kermit/Dynamix
and Lone Slonono/IRIS.«»
«»
In the beginning D.I.S.C. was made by Germans, but now all countries were
represented. So many groups and persons, no wonder the staff was called the
Salad team.«»
«»
D.I.S.C. 5 was still coded by MCS/Level 4, Logo by Cougar/Level 4, Menufont
was done by Whitestar/Level 4, Fastloader was created by Mic/Level 4,
Scrollfont was drawn by CMR/Level and the music was made by Rob Hubbard.
Various persons made the comix and JPN/Level 4 was responsible for the
English. The contact persons were Yankee, Pincher, Chris and Jpn.«»
«»
D.I.S.C. was having its best days with a lot of readers that were awaiting
every new issue.«»
«»
«c4»ISSUE 6«»
«»
«c1»After a big delay according to the makers at that time, D.I.S.C. 6 hit
the scene in January/February 1991. The mag was smaller with 49 articles
and 142 pages of reading, and perhaps not as good as the previous issues.
One of the reasons of the delay was that Jpn didn't think Level 4
cooperated enough and didn't do all what they could for D.I.S.C. Jpn left
Level 4...«»
This time the main-editing teams were Addonic, Dynamix and IRIS and the
main-editors were Chris, Yankee, Jpn, Pincher, Keo, Condor & Jon. As always
some new ones and the old ones.«»
«»
Persons that supported issue 6 were Crazy, Andy/Amiga Industries, D.Traumer/IRIS,
Black Minor/Odyssey, Zodiac/Sanity, Duke/Level 4, Tron, Jonas/Unicorn,
Franz/IBB, Flinx/Fantasy Force, Lore/IRIS, Timetraveller/Dynamix, Paradigm/Addonic,
Join the Union, Mistral/Miranda, Sultan/Delicious Dreams, Jason/Energy,
Karl, Andy, Condor/Panopanic Designs, Warhead/Panic, Pincher, Laierbrain/
Crusaders, Marc/TRSI, Jean/Chronance, Jester, Stingray/Teno, Chris/IRIS,
Luc de Maroy/IRIS etc.«»
«»
The credits list was the same as always, but this time Romeo Knight did the
music. Marc/TRSI digitized all pictures included.«» 
«»
Yes, this time the D.I.S.C. Team presented pictures from parties, party-
reports, magazine corner, demo-corner, interviews, news 'n'info, music-stuff,
demo-charts, about games, friendship articles, scene-stories, about modems,
sysops and crackers etc.«»
«»
The persons to contact were still Yankee, Pincher, Chris and Jpn. But Jpn
had less time to invest these days.«»
«»
«c4»ISSUE 7«»
«»
«c1»Once again D.I.S.C. got delayed. The D.I.S.C. Team had problems with getting
enough articles. Jpn had founded his own crew Vertical and spent some time
on that, Pincher started to loose faith in the project and Yankee was slow.
Jpn was stepping back a bit. R0ly took over the correction in English and
Commander Rainbow in German. In any case, D.I.S.C. 7 got released in April/
May'91.«»
«»
The result was 61 articles and 152 pages... pretty good actually. BUT we
were all feeling that D.I.S.C. was getting weaker. Especially since Jpn
didn't have the same motivation and the other key persons were getting
slower. Now there were only two main-editing teams left: IRIS and Addonic.
Main-eds were said to be Yankee, Pincher, Jpn, IRIS, L'4. Other important
persons were Flinx, Condor & Jon, CMR and R0ly. Well, the exact list should
be something like this: The Huineist, Blackstar/Cryptoburners, Flinx/Fantasy
Force, Chris/IRIS, Jason/Energy, Jonah, Jon & Condor, Wild Thing/Cytax, Paradigm/Addonic,
Cyber Pirate/Axis, Fin, Luc de Maroy/IRIS, Sultan/Ope, CMR/Level 4, Karl, Neulatex/Skillion,
Jedi/Coma, Dartagnan/Axis, Martin/D-Tech&Amiga User, Frap/Magnetic Fields,
Dan/Level 4, R0ly/Level 4, Zodiac/Sanity, Hedge, Lone Slonono/IRIS and
D.Traumer/IRIS.«» 
«»
As you can see, alot of scene personalties and cool groups that have played
a major role in the proud scene history wrote for D.I.S.C.«»
As always the mag provided funny stories, jokes, news, charts, demo corner,
party-reports, scene-stories, scene-reports, music stuff, gfx-matters and
more. Every time D.I.S.C. had this cool startup text and included sources
on the disk.«»
«»
D.I.S.C. looked the same and no real improvements were made. Code was
done by Snap/Level 4, Logo drawn by Cougar/Vertical, Music by R0ly/Level 4,
Menufont by Whitestar/Level 4, Scrollfont was pixelled by CMR/Level 4 and the
comix were provided by DPE and Hedge.«»
«»
«c4»ISSUE 8«»
«»
«c1»Summer arrived and the same did a new issue of D.I.S.C. It got released
earlier than expected, in July/August'91 (real release date was end of June).
That was probably also the only postive thing about it. D.I.S.C. was definately
going down...«»
«»
Jpn had stepped down and didn't assemble D.I.S.C. anymore, Pincher took over
and did an ok job. Yankee was not convinced about the future of D.I.S.C.
There was a lack of organisation. Only 34 articles got presented to the
reader. Those included the usual scene-articles, jokes, music-matters,
expo, news, demo-reviews etc. The only new thing was a new font. The makers
were the same, with adding Fox/Vertical to the creditslist for making the
music and Addonic for doing the comix.«»
«»
Main-editing teams were still Addonic and IRIS, and now also Vertical and
Sanity were included. Zodiac/Sanity had been involved in the project
for a while and rumours at that time were saying that Sanity were taking
over the complete mag, but they were strongly refused. Yankee, Chris and
Pincher were key persons. The creditslist were also very simple as only
few people contributed; Jonah/Unicorn, Ribald/Argon, Ralph/Powerdrive,
Jim Rainey, Yankee/Addonic, Bubble/Sanity, Zodiac/Sanity and Pincher/Vertical.«»
«»
It was very sad that the Salad team was falling apart, but some had still
not lost hope. They were working with getting a new code and design.
Chaos/Sanity had been getting ideas for new design in talks with the D.I.S.C.
Team.«»
«»
D.I.S.C. 8 ended a bit optimistic with the promise to get a new code from
Chaos. At this time the other new mags were all saying D.I.S.C. was going down
and some even slaughtered the latest issues.«»
