«c1»D.I.S.C. is a non-commercial publication made by sceners for sceners!
Therefore we make no money whatsoever out of our work. It's just done to
entertain the true amiga scene freaks.«»
«»
I could tell you that it's not allowed to sell this production or in any
other way gain profit on D.I.S.C. without the written permission of the
Main-Team. However, it's not very much to gain on scene-productions anymore
and personally I don't care too much if people manage to gain some profit
out of our work.«»

It IS allowed to spread this publication provided it remains unmodified.«»

As this production is protected by norwegian and international copyright
laws and I'm myself soon a lawyer, we could IF we wish start a trial against
any violator of our simple rules. However, if the D.I.S.C. archieve is spread
unmodified, we will most likely not take any legal actions.«»
