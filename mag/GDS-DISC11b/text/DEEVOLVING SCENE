«c1»THE DEEVOLVING SCENE«»

«c3»BY DARKHAWK/IRIS«»
«»«as»
«c5»The scene is getting worse, people are 
getting less skilled and the
productions are not as good as they
once were.«»
«»
What is this? A bitter attempt at
proclaiming that the scene ruled in
89', and that todays scene simply
sucks? No, not this time. The aim of
this article is to show you that we
have, in general, become less skilled
in what we do. The standard has
fallen together with the old masters
leaving the scene.«» 
«»
It is simple, really, «c2»it takes time to
become a skilled scener, «c5»it takes time
to master democoding, it takes time to
become a skilled pixeller (but you can
always use retouchingprograms and a
scanner ofcourse), it takes time to
make good melodies, it takes time to
write interesting articles, and so on.
So, at any one point, we will have the
real skilled sceners, those who
produce the memorable stuff, we will
have the middleclass (so to speak),
those who produce most stuff, but
stuff that isn't THAT good. Those
people will either evolve into real
skilled sceners, or they will stand
still at their current standard,
because they don't have the skill or
time needed to evolve. Lastly we have
all the new sceners (all 3, heh), who
are standing at the bottom, and have a
lot left to learn in terms of skills.«»  
«»
In the not so distant past, groups 
like «c2»Nerve Axis, Embassy and TBL «c5»have
shown us that they are at the peak of
their abilities, making some very good
and memorable productions, being the
top of what we have seen so far in
terms of Amiga demos overall I think.
That was some years ago however, and I
don't think that any group today have
what it takes to produce something
like that. Most groups can never reach
that level of coding for instance, as
displayed in those demos. Not to say
that all effects in e.g. Embassy demos
are all that good, but they're still
beyond most coders. It takes time and
dedication to reach that level, time
or dedication that sceners nowadays
do not seem to possess. This is not to
say that sceners nowadays are lame and
unskilled ofcourse, but it still seems
like there are too many of the
middleclass, and not very many
supertalents emerging from there. When
have you last seen a demo as good as
e.g. «c2»Tint? «c5»A writer as skilled as
«c2»Fishwave? «c5»And so on. There are some
nice productions released in 99 and 00
too ofcourse, but not on a par with
the good in 96-97 really. How can that
be? Simply put, all the really skilled
people of yesterday have left the
scene, and there have been no one to
take their thrones, nobody has had the 
combination of skill, time and will 
needed it seems. Generally speaking 
ofcourse.«» 
«»
The headline, about the «c2»deevolving
scene, «c5»refers to the fact that
things can go backwards too. The
German philosopher Hegel thought that
history was a straightforward
development in time, that things
constantly became better and better,
the longer one came. That is probably
the prevailing thought in the scene
now too, that we have always and
steadily improved and bettered
ourselves. Well, that is easy to see
when comparing with demos from 89',
but when looking at the demos
released in 96-98, one can see no such
improvement, infact one can safely (?)
say that the demos after that became
less good, looking at the overall
picture. We have degenerated so to
speak, because we don't have that kind
of talents right now, who could make
something similar. Atleast they are
not together in one single, active
group it seems. The Amiga userbase has
become smaller, the scene has become
smaller, and naturally, the knowhow
pool in the scene has also become
smaller as a result. That is only
logical, and it is hard to do
something against it, except hoping
the scene will become larger again.«»
«»
But anyway, it is important to note
that while I say that the scene on the
whole, has «c2»degenerated «c5»from the
previous years, because we are lacking
some talent from those years, I don't
say that there are not really good
productions around, or that there are
not skilled people left. Not at all, I
don't want to paint that bleak a
picture, and I also think that we can
evolve again eventually, but it takes
time and motivation to do this, and
each time a talent with all his
knowhow and experience leaves the
scene, the skillpool is diminished,
and if a new scener takes the place of
the old, it is a good thing, but it
will take years for the new scener to
reach the level of the old. And now
that the scene is smaller, it is also
much harder for the new scener to
actually get the knowledge and
experience needed, and that's why
things are as they are, I think. But
this is actually an old topic, having
been discussed virtually every year
since 91', hehe. Still, I think that
the facts are with me right now, and
that we have reached a point where it
is real hard for those that are left,
to take up the heritage from those who
pass away. Still, if we would all but 
try, bettering oruselves instead of
releasing mediocre productions,
dedicating more time to the scene,
etc., then things would become better
again, and we would evolve again. But
who is left who want to spend that
much time on the scene? It is an evil
circle, the scene gets poorer when
talent leaves, and because the scene
is poorer (less interesting), new
talent does not want to spend the time
needed to replace the old ones.«»
«»
The conclusion is not THAT negative as
might be implied by my previous words
however, we still have talents, the
scene is still around and fun, and we
can make most of what we please if we
try, so I'm only showing you a
movement in the scene, that the
quality of productions were higher
some years ago, and that it is more
tough going now, I'm not saying that
everything is impossible or hopeless
