«as»«»
«c1»Chris is one of the few sceners that have been at the scene from the
start, and been very active during these years. «c4»The D.I.S.C. Team
«c1»wanted to take a closer look at this scener and find out who he is and
what he has done.«»
«»
«c2»Before we start this interview Chris, could I get you something to drink?«»
«»
«c5»CH: well, a cup of coffee... but, real "café" and not the terrible drink
that you can find in so many countries !«»
«»
«c2»Will French Roast do?«»
«»
«c5»CH: fine !«»
«»
«c2»Please tell the D.I.S.C. readers some words about yourself and about
your first meeting with the scene.«»
«»
«c5»CH: I joined the scene about 15 years ago, it was with the Amstrad Computer.
No, the C64 was not my first one... then, I decided to buy an Amiga, it
was an Amiga 1000. After watching and using a few productions from
sceners, I decided to contribute to it and with a few friends, we
created Iris, it was in 1987.«»
«»
«c2»You founded IRIS: Illi Recentes ImperatoreS 
13 years ago and the group is still very much alive. How was it to build
up such a team, plan productions, organize it and get fresh members?
What do you think of those IRIS years?«»
«»
«c5»CH: Well, it was as difficult as nowadays... the most skillfull ones are the
ones who have not enough time (or you can say, lazy) and when you recrute, 
for example, 10 new members, only one or two are really good and active. 
Nothing changed !!! But, at the beginning, we had a few ones who was living 
close to my place, I was able to motivate them enough to release regulary 
some new productions.«»
«»
And I guess, the best way to motivate them was that I was organizing Iris
meetings in my parents place... two times a year, about 10 young guys
was coming to my place... we had about three or four computers and we
were building what make Iris wellknown for, real friendship !«»
«»
«c2»You have been making some productions yourself when being in IRIS, which
was that?«»
«»
«c5»CH: Nothing very serious... the most interresting stuff was my contribution
to several disk magazines (DISC, Bad Tongue, Zine,...).«»
«»
«c2»You're being very modest. There got to be at least 100 issues of your various
packs.«»
«»
«c5»CH: Well, I can't consider those packs as real work.«»
«»
«c2»IRIS have really been one of the most productive groups of all time.
Which is your favourite IRIS productions and why?«»
«»
«c5»CH: Well,... it can be the second demo that we released... it was supposed
to compete to a party but, unfortunately, there was no party but some police
men checking all our disks and taking our identity.«»
«»
«c2»Which demo was that? The Marseilles demo? Workbench demo? Or perhaps Artefact?«»
«»
«c5»CH: I think it was the Artefact one.«»
«»
And the other production that I prefer is the vectorball demo, it was
released in 1992, I think, and was a real big succes.«»
«»
«c2»Is this the famous Spacedepths demo which got good critics in the leadings
mags at that time?«»
«»
«c5»CH: Yes, it is.«»
«»
«c2»What do you remember best of all the years you spent in IRIS, and who were
the main people behind this crew in those years?«»
«»
«c5»CH: The best thing that I remember is that we can build something great
with people from a whole planet !! There was not really some main people
in Iris, everybody was important... even the ones that we kept a few
weeks !!!«»
«»
«c2»The 10th of August 1994 a new group got founded under the name of Gods. You
left your IRIS crew and became the organiser of Gods. You fast built up a
very strong force with a lot of productions. Please tell more about it. Is
there anything special about Gods compared to other teams, for example IRIS?«» 
«»
«c5»CH: With Iris, we gave a chance to everybody... with gOds, we decided to make
something great and fast. All gOds members were sceners with an experience
of the scene.«»
«»
«c2»In Gods you have also made a few productions. Which productions are we
talking about«»
«»
«c5»CH: Well, the productions I was involved was the ones where I was able to
use my both passions of music and writing... nothing serious at all.«»
«»
«c2»What are your favourite Gods productions and why?«»
«»
«c5»CH: If I give you my fav. productions, it will make a long list. I love
all of them and especially the Toys demo.«»
«»
«c2»Gods have also moved over to PC and released some demos at various parties
and won. What is the future of Gods? Amiga? PC? Internet?«»
«»
«c5»CH: gOds is now a mainly sleeping crew... but, if somebody want to bring
the light which will wake it up... you're welcome.... just email me !
The future is for me on Internet, but Amiga has also many things to bring
and the PC, too.«»
«»
«c2»Why do you think Gods more or less turned inactive?«»
«»
«c5»CH: Well, for many of us, we find some time for the scene as long as we are
student. Then, one day, we join the "real life"... job, overtime, girlfriend
which become a wife (or a longtime gf)... and the scene, well... it starts
to be a part of the past. We are getting older !«»
«»
«c2»What is it that is so facinating with the scene since you have been here
for so many  years? What is your motivation?«»
«»
«c5»CH: Well, I have to admit that I am away from it since 2 or 3 years. You
can not consider me as a real scener.«»
«»
My motivation is just... friendship !«»
«»
«c2»What does the frienship in the scene mean to you?«»
«»
«c5»CH: It means a lot of things... with trust, with faith between each other,
we can build the stairs which will lead us to a better world.«»
«»
«c2»What is the difference between the scene when you started and the scene
today you think?«»
«»
«c5»CH: Well, I really don't know how is the scene nowadays on Amiga nor on Pc,
but I know that I find the similar scene on Internet that on my beginning
on Amiga.«»
«»
«c2»You were one of the mega swappers of the scene. Why did you swap instead
of code, pixell or make music? With the introduction of internet,
is swapping definately out?«»
«»
«c5»CH: A long time ago, I was coding a little... but swapping is boring,
swapping is expensive and nobody want to swap... so, as I was in charge
of the group, I had to do what nobody wanted to do. That is the job
of the boss !! And in another way, it was the best way to know what
happen everywhere.«»
«»
«c2»Hehe...  so you just had to do what noone else wanted too? ;)«»
«»
«c5»CH: At the beginning, yes... after a few years, it was too late for
me, I got the bad habbit to swap and couldn't stay a day without a
letter and some new stuffs !«»
«»
«c2»You have been writing for several mags in the past. Which ones? We must
not forget that the reason why YOU dear reader is able to read D.I.S.C.
is because of Chris was one of the main persons behind D.I.S.C. in the
very beginning. Please tell more about the D.I.S.C. project and your
mag projects.«»
«»
«c5»CH: Well, I wrote for the several mags... the ones that I remember are:«»
«»
- Disc,«» 
- Zine,«»
- the Bad Tongue,«»
and some others.«»
«»
I was also making a paper magazine that I was sending to all my contacts !«»
«»
The first reason of DISC was to make a mag for computer-freaks. It was
set-up by a german contact of mine from Level4.«»
«»
«c2»What do you guess he would think if he knew the D.I.S.C. project was still
alive 11 years after he started it?«»
«»
«c5»CH: I am sure he won't believe it !!!«»
«»
«c2»You have been writing many scene reports during your time in the scene,
and especially about the French scene. What do you think of todays scene
and especially the French scene?«» 
«»
«c5»CH: Well, I am away from it since a too long time to be able to say something
right.«»

a fish in the ocean of computer world !«»

since you've been busy building up several internet-based firms. Please tell
