«c1»Group-Interview with Ephidrena«»
«al»«»
«c3»BY GHANDY/DARKAGE^GODS«»
«»
«c2»First of all - each member: Please introduce yourself. Real name, age, what 
are
you doing in real life, hobbies (if the power is switched off!), what kind 
of
future you`re dreaming of etc. Use as much space as you want!!!«»
«»
«»
«c6»Frequent: «c5»Most people I know on this planet know me as Åsmund T. Johansen.
Currently im 22 years old, born 13/10 1977, and studying
boring information technology. In Ephidrena, I am together with Zixaq
responsible for the music in our productions. My dream is to still continue
making music, and perhaps get a contract with a recordcompany. Who knows
what the future tells?«»
«»
«c6»cheetah: «c5»My name is Sondre Kippenes, and I'm born the 22nd of february 1980,
which means that I'm currently 20 years old. (Actually I'm the youngest 
member
of eph.) At the moment, in my "real life", I'm working as a security guard 
at
Oslo Airport, but this is only only temporary. I just finished some 
schooling
and expect to study some more later, but I simply haven't got a clue what to
become in my life. Therefore I need to take some time to figure my life out.
My only future plans are to do my civil service (as I'm a pacifist I'll do
this instead of a military service), and I have hopes for serving somewhere
abroad as this has recently been allowed by the Norwegian authorities. But
who knows what the future will bring??«»
«»
«c6»Loaderror: «c5»My names Espen Aamodt, actually spelled with ancient norwegian
characters, but Ill save you for interpreting those. Nowadays, Im
studying computer science, learning everything thats boring about
computers. Hobbies, well I try to do some sports once in a while,
but thats become very rare. I like going to the cinema, and also the
innards of a good can of beer :) As for the future, who knows? I
just live on day at a time, but being ever so hungry for
information on all sorts of computer subjects, especially
computergraphics, my dream would be to make computergraphics for
a living, in a demo kind of way. Take the artform one step
further perhaps.«»
«»
«c6»Cyberstarr: «c5»OK i'm Cyberstarr and in real life I'm a student at Computer
Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).
I've been quite inactive in Ephidrena for a couple of years now,
and I don't really contribute with much at the moment. My dream for the
future is to create the ultimate scene demo, but I think it'll take some
revolutionary coding and design. I'm not in a hurry.«»
«»
«c6»Zixaq: «c5»My realname is Øyvind P. Noste, born 27/8/76, and are currently
studiying. I started with Amiga when I was 14 years old. I first wanted to
be a graphichian, but I soon spent more time in Protracker than in
Deluxepaint. Since I make music in many different styles, I came up with
the nick sikksakk, but spelled it "zixaq".
When it comes to music, I'm never 100% satisfied with my tunes, and I hate
to release bad or not-so-good work. Anyway, I'm enjoy making oldschool and
goatrance. Chiptunes can also be very fun to make, but I like weird ambient
the most. I will hopefully get "not-so-lazy" in the future,
so I can get real famous :) OK, don't forget to contact me if you need
a tune for something.«»
«»
«»
--------«»
«»
«»
«c2»I was crazy enough to download at ftp.amigascne.org ALL Eph-releases that 
ever
came out. Didn`t know they are that many. Maybe you want to make a sort of
Demo & Intro-Graphia with the names of the demos, which party they came out,
some comments about them etc. (starting with the oldest production at first)«»
«»
«»
«»
«c5»- Such a summary for 28 prods will take to much time and space for this
Interview. But Zixaq will here present some short info of our four most
important prods so far:«»
«»
«c4»Photons Dodraugen-Remix:«»
«»
«c5»I think this is the first demo we start to make really cool
things. The demos before had often been without direction and
real design. This is by the way the first demotune I'm
pleased with. I made mostly of it in the beginning, then
Frequent added some things in the end. This tune started with
that Cheetah and Loaderror thought we should have some real
hard music. We found some samples gathered by Frequent. I
started to make drumloops, and added some other samples,
riffs and effects. We had really fun making this demo. We
spent a week at my house during the summer 1997. We took a swim
in a local lake and spent the nights being creative. Loaderror
got much better coding, and I think this was a little breakthrough for
our next demos.«»
«»
«»
«»
«c4»Substral:«»
«»
«c5»After the "hurry and rush"-work with Dridiriija, we wanted to
make something great. Now we were full of inspiration to make
a hard demo. I made bassline and  drums with heavy and tough
samples. Luckily the others liked it, and we worked on the
demo at my house right before christmas. Loaderror coded the
rest at TP, and  Frequent finished the demosong. The new with
this demo was Stoney's animations. Without his contribution
the demo wouldn't have been the same. Big thanks to Accede
for a helping hand at TP.«»
«»
«»
«c4»Flux:«»
«»
«c5»After the success with Substral Ephidrena had gained a name
in the Amigascene. We were of course thrilled. It looked like
the polish scene liked us a little bit more than the rest of
the scene. :) After a hard and breaking demo we wanted to
make something nice and cosy. Cheetah made textures with
bright colours, and Stoney made more animations.
Concerning the music we decided to make two songs. I was very
happy about that, since people always thought that Frequent
made all the music when we cooperated. I was sick and tired
of never getting the credits for demomusic, especially on
tunes I had done mostly on. Well, this time it wasn't going
to be a problem. Frequent had made a soft, floating and fine
tune which fitted good as an end-tune. I had the honour of
making the main-tune.
I wanted to use strings to get a massive sound, but also
drums and tb303. I mixed acoustic drums with elctronic drums
to get a groove out of it. I sampled the string-chords from
my synth, and made the 303-sequences in 303-tracker. Mod2samp
was a handy thing in this tune. This is probably the
4channel-tune I'm most pleased with.
We started on the demo at Cheetah's place, and finished it at
TG99. By the way, that party sucked, and we decided to go to
MekkaSymposium next year.«»
«»
«c4»Concrete:«»
«»
«c5»Loaderror and Cheetah wanted again something hard. We still
wanted Stoney's animations. Loaderror was now a good coder,
which allowed us to do cooler stuff, technically. Frequent
and myself decided to cooperate on the tune. Cheetah had an
idea for the beat, and we started right away. First we made
the acoustic drum-beat. Then I made all the parts with drums
and bassline in it. Frequent made the ambient-parts; the one
in the middle and the end. This is our best cooperation, I
guess. Well, what more can I say? We won The Party 1999. It
was a great production.«»
«»
----«»
«c2»What I was missing was a slideshow from Cheetah. I`m sure he has drawn
enough great pics to make a good slideshow out of them, didn`t he?? Or did
you never wanted to make productions like slideshows, diskmags or music-
disks????«»
«»
«»
«c6»Frequent: «c5»- We are simply to busy working with demos, so making something
other kind if prods is not our highest priority, for saying it in a such 
way.
An personally I really like to compose music for demos 'n intros, since
it visualize your inner thougts about the music you make in many ways.«»
«»
«c6»cta: «c5»Hmm, actually I don't concider my production of graphics good enough
for a slideshow I would be really satisfied with. I guess I should have done
a whole new collection of images, but this is easier said than done 
(pixeling
really takes a lot of time) When it comes to musicdisks, I remember 
discussing
plans for a zixaq musicdisk, but I guess we never got that far. I guess 
we're
not very structured that way. Besides, loaderror isn't very fond of doing
interfaces :> Diskmags have never been concidered.«»
«»
«c6»loaderror: «c5»slideshows, musicdisks, DISKMAGS??? ARGH!! The very
most boring code I've ever done, was a little piece of code, that
wrote some text onto the screen. So if Im not very pushed, I'll
stick to coding demos. I think thats the best way to show off
both our individual skills, aswell as our cooperative skills.«»
«»
«c6»Cyberstarr: «c5»We're hardcore industrial demo sceners. Or at least
we like to think so.«»
«»
«c6»Zixaq: «c5»Loaderror hate that kind of coding. We want to make
musicdisks, but the demos always get in front.«»
«»
«»
----«»
«»
«»
«»
«c2»At your homepage you wrote that you`re living away from each others quite a
long distance. If the email should be the way of your communication, why
didn`t you ever accept a foreign member?? Should not be easy to visit
eachothers if one of yours is living in the south of Norway, the next f.e.
in the west and some others in the north etc.! What is then the difference
between your crew and other groups consisting of members in different 
european
countries like Darkage, Scoopex etc. ????«»
«c6»fqt- «c5»We are not living so very distant from each other... Some miles, yes.
But still close enough. Since we're have developed a very good friendship
between us, we have decided to keep the same memberlist that we had from
the start. (wich perhaps are one of the biggest difference between us
and other groups)«»
«»
«c6»cta: «c5»All members come from places in eastern Norway, and in fact half the
group (zixaq, Stoney & Cheetah) come from the same place (Gjerdrum). So
it's not that great a distance between us.
   The core of our cooperation has always been, and still is, physical
meetings at each others homes where we have the opportunity to work closely,
and not inet/email. As said, we have all become good friends over the years,
and the joining of other members has never been seriously concidered. The
feeling I have is that we - the 6 if us - aren't that much "members" of eph,
we are more a bunch of friends keeping in touch through this scene thing.
Eph is just what we call ourselves. The thought of other people "joining" 
our
group just seems very wrong.«»
«»
«c6»Loady: «c5»Kind of agree with cheetah. I think a new member would
have felt very strange as we've been this bunch from the start
off.«»
«»
«c6»Cyberstarr: «c5»we've been six members for 5 years. We've focused on
productions and have had enough people to feed the coders.«»
«»
«c6»Zixaq: «c5»Some of the most important things with ephidrena is that
we can meat eachother once in a while. When we are home with
our parents houses at vacations, we don't live too far from
eachother. If we had members that never could join our
meetings, it would have been a drawback. The most important
thing with us is that we are buddies, with a social connection.«»
«»
«»
-------«»
«»
«»
«»
«c2»What are your reasons not to convert to the PC? Not that I want that, god
beware, you`re really important for the Amiga Scene in my eyes, but 
observing
the ongoings the past years with Escom, Viscorp, Phase5 etc. etc. one could
really understand that step. Is it more the computer or more the Scene 
keeping
you on track??«»
«»
«c6»Fqt: «c5»Important to the Amiga scene? Never thought about us in that way.
Althoug we got comments about our prods, they varies from "fucking good"
to "nothing specail", so....
For scening in general, Amiga is a excellent platform to develop demos,
both for the sake of our scene, and for those nice features the amy got.
The  entusiasm among the scene today is still quite good.<«»
«»
«c6»cta: «c5»Well, I like doodling in brilliance, so I guess the ami suits me just
fine :)«»
«»
«c6»loaderror: «c5»The PC isnt very inspiring, and I feel very
comfortable in my amiga environment, where I can code, make
graphics and music very easily. Ive been looking at direct X
stuff on PC, but I still dont really feel like doing anything
really :) And the thought about lotsa lamers that dont understand
why you should bother to do a 4k when you have DivX and Mpg, dont
really inspire either. On amiga, more people appreciate what you
do even if it doesnt look like the latest hollywood movies.«»
«»
«c6»Cyberstarr: «c5»The Amiga is still surrounded with a special culture, so it's
mainly the scene. Having said that, I'm learning to program C++ on PC
hardware, but on the BeOS operating system.«»
«»
«c6»Zixaq: «c5»I guess both. For a long time no one of us had PC.
Loaderror is good at Amiga, so I guess converting to the PC
means a lot of extra-work for him. For me it's better to make
PC-demos, concerning the multichannel-opportunities. I guess
for the graphics aswell. It's not impossible that we go PC in
the future. It's hard with the Amiga since there are so few
upgrades on software.«»
«»
«»
-------«»
«»
«»
«»
«c2»The idea of style is the key to all your demos it seems. I`m sure you have a
sort of philosophy behind that, don`t you??«»
«c6»Zixaq: «c5»Yeah. In each demo we try to describe an ambience. A
feeling/atmosphere, you could say.«»
«»
«c6»Fquent: «c5»Trying to explore your own capabilities and think new and different.
To many prods today lack in induviduality. They are way to much all alike.
People seem a bit affraid to try making their own trends, and just follow
the majority in mainstream demomaking.«»
«»
«c6»cta: «c5»Dunno about this philosophy thing. What I can say about our so-called
style & design is that from the start, our productions weren't particularly
technically impressive. But we tried to overcome our limitations by putting
effort into the aesthetic sides of our prods. Even now, when making a demo,
what we spend our time and labour on is the "design", i.e. the look, sound
and general feeling of the demo, more than to impress other coders. Many
good ideas have been conceived during seemingly endless discussions
concerning design & style.«»
«»
«c6»load: «c5»Think about it. For years and years, the routines have been
the center of attention in a demo, something which really left
the design part unexplored. I think design was left out due to
the lack of memory and fast,big storage mediums. This has left
the design world relatively untouched. Theres just not that many
more new routines to do, but theres almost an infinite number of
different styles of design, which has never been in a demo.
I kind of code the other way around nowadays, instead of
making a routine, and then do the graphics for it, and some music
on top. I need some graphics first, and let that graphics
inspire me for what Im going to code, and then our musicians make
some stuff that will fit the style afterwards.«»
«»
«»
------«»
«c2»When making a demo, how does that happen?? Is there one leading person 
telling
the rest what to do? Is it a sort of group-movement where everybody is 
giving
in his own ideas? Or is it maybe the coder alone that decides how the 
product
will look like ???«»
«»
«c6»Zixaq: «c5»We all decide and come with ideas.«»
«»
«c6»fqt: «c5»When making a product, its important that all agree about what kind of
style, concept etc... as early as possible. Whitout such co-operation,
nothing will work. And most important, if the coder refuse to work, trash
the project! An unpleasant coder only makes troubles...«»
«»
«c6»cta: «c5»I don't think there's one answer to this question. We do not have a
standard procedure when starting a demo, and most of our prods have their 
own
story. One thing in common of most our recent prods is that the initiative
often comes from loaderror, which is quite natural as he's our coder and all
work depends on him. Besides that I guess it is safe to say that we put down
lots of time in talking about what the new prods should be like, probably
more than it actually takes making them. But then talking and planning is
also an important part of making demos.«»
«»
«c6»load:«»
«c5»1. I start off with a routine, and maybe some mock up of some
graphics and music.«»
2. The others disagree, and then theres some arguments«»
3. We agree, and from this point on, theres full speed ahead.«»
4. We finish, but still have a lot of stuff we would have liked
   to put in.«»
«»
«»
--------«»
«»
«»
«»
«c2»Each member please: What`s your impression of the Amiga demoscene in the 
year
2000 ?? (releases, irc idling, general atmosphere, parties etc.)«»
«»
«c6»Fqt: «c5»The Amigascene has become much more "underground" nowdays, if you 
compare
with the scene anno 94 and earlier. The way of making demos are more extreme
and exprimental nowdays, wich I find very good for developing new consepts.
The mood between most groups is really great. And there's still aranged 
scene
only partys, wich i like very much. The PPc has given us new possibilities,
so lets hope Amiga inc will sucseed with their forthcoming project.«»
«c6»cta: «c5»Impression? Hmm, that's a tough one :> I really don't have much of an
impression of the Amiga scene nowadays. I've seen few really good 
productions
so far this year. (Gift was mighty by the way) Haven't been to any party for
ages either, so I really can't tell.«»
«»
«c6»Loaderror: «c5»As for the scene today, respect to the people making
good productions which I love such as Potion, DCS, Loonies,
Ozone, Tbl, and Zigs latest demo, and Napalm :). And perhaps
those people complaining about the dead scene, should download
some productions and watch them. Its normal to think it was all
better before though. The human mind forgets all that was bad in
the past (like the design of most demos, which sucked!).«»
«»
«c6»Zixaq: «c5»I'm not so sure. I guess it's falling. I think it's far
between the good productions. The #Amigascne are sometimes
cool, sometimes few people.«»
«»
«»
--------«»
«»
«»
«»
«c2»Each member:What are the scenerelated sites you visit from time to time? 
Don`t
tell me you don`t know http://Scenet.de  hehe!«»
«»
«c6»Fqt: «c5»Scenet.de, Amigascne.org, Dhs.nu, scene.org, div group pages.«»
«»
«c6»cta: «c5»scenet?? nah. I tend to visit gfxzone from time to time. Really nice 
gfx
site. And 3daddict is a nice fellow that knows to appreciate some good 
design.«»
«»
«c6»load: «c5»scene.org, amigascne.org, div. groups' pages.«»
«c6»Cyberstarr: «c5»welcome.to/ephidrena, soon www.ephidrena.net«»

«c6»Zixaq: «c5»Ftp://amigascne.org and other Amigasites.«»
Ftp://scene.org and other music/graphic-sites.«»

«»
«»
«c2»What can we expect from your crew in the future? Heard there`s a cooperation
release planned together with the danish Loonie-s-heeps!«»
«»
«c6»Load: «c5»well, we'll see about that. I said yes to do it of course,
as that sounded like fun, but doing stuff with people that are
hundreds of miles away, isnt that easy. So I think we've agreed
to put that cooperation on ice for a while. As for eph
productions, we will probably move more into typography styles,
and we will not do a 3d engine demo, as I dont think 3d engines
can do anything exciting on amiga really. I like better to mess
about with single objects so that the effects are more a part of a
whole composition together with the graphics and music.«»
«»
«»
«c6»cta: «c5»So far there have been times when motivation has seemed years away, but 
it
seems like we always manage to discover some of the magic again. So if this
trend continues I guess you'll see more prods from us also in the future.«»
«»
«c6»Frequent: «c5»Dont really expect something, then you will get more surprised
about us in the future :)«»
«»
«c6»Zixaq: «c5»I imagine that we start making "demos" more like music-
videos. I mean productions for a bigger public, not only the
scene. Loaderror has allready made graphics/animations which was
shown at a DrumAndBass-party. More things like that.«»
«»
«»
-------«»
«»
«»
«»
«c2»What is your honest opinion about the following productions:«»
«»
«c4»a) Impossible by Loonies - «c6»Impressive code, but design, where`s design
afterall?«»
«»
- Lacks when it comes to Concept.... It.... was..... BOOOORING!!!!
Why cant we discuss Potions gift instead? It simply rules :)«»
«c4»b) We ride on our enemies by Skarla - «c6»Is there a trend into 3D demos like it
is on the PC Scene??«»
«»
- Yes. 3d is a trend. But 3d brings posibilities. Anyway, we liked
Smokebomb better, why didnt that win?«»
«»
«c4»c) Divine slideshow by Gods^Darkage«»
«»
«c6»- Ok enough.«»
«»
«c4»d) the less active diskmags which are still alive like Showtime, Eurochart,
Oepir Risti, Devotion etc.«»
«»
«c6»- Oepir Rules... The rest is ok.«»
«»
«c4»e) Grid 40kb intro by Nature«»
«c6»- Nice codework and.......nice codework. Colours are a little bit
too acid. Cool sound. The production lacks a complete design.
Could have been a great goa-intro if they had used more
goaobjects :D«»
«»
«c4»f) or about the oldies like Odyssey, Hardwired, Voyage etc.etc.??«»
«»
«c4»- Odyssey«»
«»
«c6»Load: «c5»It lasted for 45 minutes, so thats whats special, didnt
really like it that much.«»
«»
«c6»Fqt: «c5»45 minutes long, an actually entertaining, if you like that kind
of demos.«»
«»
«»
«»
«c4»- Hardwired«»
«»
«c6»Load: «c5»The start rocks. But I didnt join the scene before 1995, so
I have no real affection for it the way older sceners have.«»
«»
«c6»Fqt: «c5»One of the first demos I've ever seen on Amiga. Brings tears in my
eyes when thinking about it. Liked it better than Odyssey, and one of
my personla favorites of the old school demos.«»
«»
«c4»- Voyage«»
«»
«c6»Load: «c5»Never seen it.«»
«»
«c6»Fqt: «c5»Quite ok, but it never catched my attention.«»
«»
Our all time favourites:«»
- Desert Dream, 9fingers, state of the art, sequential, nexus7,
closer, faktory, sumea, fullmoon, captured dreams, deusexmachina,
gforce, fad, zif, smokebomb, klone, valhalla, gift, gush,
freedom(4k), 1000%, muscles, wild, dance diverse #2, vision, deep
psilocybin mix, killer, electroboy, 2cb, Budbrain 1,2.«»
