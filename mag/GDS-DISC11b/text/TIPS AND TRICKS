«c5»This article is being written aimed at
the utopical, that is, on introducing
a «c2»newcomer «c5»to the scene, and what good
«c2»tricks «c5»there are in order to do well
in the scene. Let's see if I can sum
up some good advice and things to
avoid doing.«» 
«»
Firstly, when joining the scene, it
is important to find the right «c2»group
«c5»to join. Newcomers in older times
typically made a group together with
other new sceners, and started out
together. Nowadays it is more common
that the few newcomers hang around,
bettering themselves, until they can
find a group willing to let them join.
There simply are not normally enough
newcomers around in the same place to
be able to create a group together,
although nowadays, there have been
examples of that too, with groups like
Søhesten, Unique, and more recently,
Trinity. Starting off in groups like
these is usually the best thing to do,
because you learn a lot, together with
other people who are scenish beginners
like you, so you can develop your
skills together with others. Such
starter groups seldom last that long
however, because when you have
bettered yourself, you usually want to
start afresh, either in a new group,
or joining one of the older groups.
Atleast that's what has happened in
the past. It can also happen that the
group just dies off and its members
fade away from the scene. That was
what happened with the Danish group
Søhesten, after releasing two demos
within the same month, they quietly
died. However, being in such a group
must surely be way more fun than being
present on the IRC all the time,
watching things happen, and having to
wait until a group accepts one as a
new member. Thus, the first advice is
this, if you are a newcomer, try to
join another newcomer group, it will
be more fun that way, being a part of
building something in the scene
together with other new sceners.«»

Another thing that is good for you as
a starting scener, is to attend scene
«c2»parties «c5»for motivation and
inspiration. Note that I write
sceneparties, with that I mean the
smaller, scene minded parties around,
like the Euskal Party, Scene Meeting,
Spoletium, Satellite, etc., and not
the bigger parties. Meeting other
sceners is very important for your
inspiration, and will make the hobby
more interesting for you too. Infact,
getting in touch with, and meeting
other sceners is one of the most
important things about the scene. In
the past, people wrote eachother
letters and attended parties to get in
touch with eachother. Nowadays you
also have the «c2»IRC «c5»to use for getting
in touch with the rest of the scene.
What is important, especially today,
is to feel like a part of the scene,
and not be isolated, sending e.g. a
module to the coder now and then, and
otherwise doing nothing in the scene
to stay in touch with it. That is not
the way to go, and will surely leech
your motivation sooner or later.
Besides, the scene deserves your
participation.«» 
«»
Carefully rationing your time on the
IRC is another good advice I think. If
you have a modem, you are probably on
the IRC channel called «c2»#Amigascne.
«c5»Spending time there might motivate
you, chatting with other sceners,
etc., but if you spend too much time
there, the opposite will happen, and
you won't find nearly enough time to
be creative too. Knowing when to do
some work, and then actually doing it,
is a nice trait in the active scener
ofcourse. However, if you are
dependent on others, such as is the
case if you're a musician or
graphician, delivering work to a
demanding coder or organizer, things
can get frustrating if you feel that
not enough of your work gets done, or
that you have to do the requested
stuff much faster than you are
comfortable with. Finding the golden
middleway in that relationship is an
important thing to, you have to work
together with people who know you and
know what you can do, for the best
results. An issue related to that, is 
that the communication inside the 
group has to function well too,
everybody has to be updated and
informed, feeling like they
participate to the group and keeping
in touch with the other groupmembers.
That will serve to heighten the
motivation in the group and fend off
an early death because people will not
loose interest that quickly then, and
will fight to keep the group going in
hard times.«»

When starting out in the scene and
watching all the great (and not so
great, heh) productions out there, one
can easily feel daunted by all the
skill one sees, but the important
thing is not to give up and think one
self too lame or unskiled to produce
anything, you have to keep trying,
bettering yourself, and not feel like
you will never be able to contribute
with something good on the scene.
Afterall, everybody has to start out
at the bottom (or around there 
anyway). So, just keep trying, and
eventually you will find that you have
succeeded, that you are known and in a
successful group. Well maybe not, but
something like that anyway, you will
feel like you are an accepted part of
the scene. Getting into «c2»charts «c5»will be
an indicator of this, and it is always
atleast minimally nice seeing your
name there, knowing that some people
have appreciated  what you do.«»

When I first started on this article,
I thought that there was going to be
a lot of tips I could write about, but
now it seems like I'm quite empty of
any, and I have only given out very 
general and basic tips. However, all
the more particular tips and tricks of
the trade are left for you to
discover, as you «c2»find your way in the
scene, «c5»only the general tips that make
sure you have a good and long time in
the scene are needed in this article,
the rest you will quickly figure out
for yourself I think :)«»
