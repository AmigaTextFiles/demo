«c2»*** NORWEGIAN SCENE-REPORT ***«»
«»«al»
«c3»BY ZEROX/GODS«»
«»«as»
«c1»The Norwegian scene hasn't got as many members as in the past. Many good
crews have more or less faded away, like Andromeda, Stone Arts and Talent (amiga)
the latest years. But nevertheless, there are still some very good crews here
and at least a couple of teams which can compete with the best international
teams. I don't have a complete oversight nor do I pretend to have one, so please
do send me the latest information concerning your group and I'll update this
report for the next issue of D.I.S.C.«»
«»
«c6»APATHY:«»
«»
«c1»- The group has produced lots of productions during the latest years, from
intros and demos, to musicdisks and packs. The organizer Punisher left
them, so Strife has taken over again.«»
«c5»Well-Known Productions: «c2»Feedback, Dreams, Epileptic, SBS and AHA.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Strife, Maze, Chriz and Leia.«»
«»
«c6»BRAARUD CODERS:«»
«»
«c1»- They've released some productions, but I can't say I remember them.
After a period of inactivity, some of their members just returned from the
army, so perhaps some new productions will arrive soon? I think also Habber
and Frenz are creating a new group nowadays, and will more concentrate on PC-
related productions.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Bushman, Habber and Frenz?«»
«»
«c6»CONTRAZ:«»
«»
«c1»- Contraz has been one of the best norwegian teams the latest years with many
releases; both intros and demos. I first noticed them at the Gathering'95,
and afterwards they've improved quite much. The group is a result of two crews
joining forces; NSS and Black Spiders, and some of the members have been sceners
for a real long time. The latest releases I've seen were from the Mekka-Symposium
last year.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Accede, Brekke, Chauple, Enex, Isaac, Skjeggspir and Whisper.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Productions: «c2»Plong, VeryLongPrecalc, Retrospectacular, Mystiq,
Blues, Domination, Splash O'Mania II and Brunostalgia.«»
«»
«c6»DARKAGE:«»
«»
«c1»- They have two famous members in Norway. The graphician Bridgeclaw which seems
to have joined & become a double member in 1999, and the mega swapper Punisher, which is
also a double-member. Punisher is participating in ShowTime and of course with
the spreading, and Bridgeclaw has contributed in a few productions also.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Bridgeclaw & Punisher.«»
«c6»DEPTH:«»
«»
«c1»- Tbey have been in Norway since around 1994 I think. These days I can't say
I've seen anything at all from the norwegian members, it's the Danish members
which are most known and productive.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Allanon, Rolex, Sprocket and Slumgud.«»
«»
«c6»DONUT FETISH:«»
«»
«c1»- They had a small active period around 96/97 I think.  Some of the members
are still around, but I guess most of them are also double-members in other
groups, like Contraz.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Productions: «c2»Magic Milktunnel, Hvorfor Det and WionaRyder.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Accede and Niggerjack?«»

«»
«»
«c6»DUAL CREW - SHINING:«»
«»
«c1»- This is a very old team as well, but not in Norway. I'm not sure what the
norwegian members of this group have made. Except that their graphician Optic
is supporting lots of mags, like DISC, Devotion and The EuroChart online!«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Member: «c2»Optic«»
«»
«c6»EPHIDRENA:«»
«»
«c1»- This is the leading norwegian team these days after the departure of Andromeda,
perhaps in some competition with groups like Spaceballs and Contraz. They are
also one of the leading international groups these days. They have been very
active the latest years with lots of demos and intros. Their big breakthrough
got to be with the winning Concrete demo at the Party 9, but of course they've
also made some great intros that have done good at various parties.«»
«c5»Well-Known Productions: «c2»J, Pluss, Abiotic, Byte, Bier, Beer, Device 47, Børst,
Concrete, Omnicrom, Fusion Is My Energy and Flux.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Cheetah, Cynerstarr, LoadError, Frequent, Stoney and Zixaq.«»
«»
«c6»GODS:«»
«»
«c1»- This group got founded in 1994 and was very active the next 3 years. The latest
years they have not been very active on amiga. They norwegian side of this crew
was probably at its best around 1995. They're behind a certain diskmag called
D.I.S.C. and some slideshows. The demos and intros were mainly done by the French
members in cooperation with the norwegian graphicians.«»

«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Bridgeclaw, Typhoon and Zerox.«»
«»
«c6»HAUJOBB:«»
«»
«c1»- The norwegian side of Haujobb is perhaps not the most productive one, but
that's perhaps not their fault. Two of the members are editors and are
awaiting the source for their mag Friendchip.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Arcane, Sixpack and Xhale.«»
«»
«c6»IRIS:«»
«»
«c1»- This crew was very active in Norway from around 1990 until 1994, when some of
the norwegian members founded Gods. They released productions such as HitPack,
A Pack Of Fun, D.I.S.C. in addition to some intros. After 1994 there haven't
been many norwegian members of this old group. The most known the latest years
have been MJ, but he got kicked out because of inactivity last year.
Now there is only one norwegian member left.«»

«c6»RAVE NETWORK OVERSCAN:«»
«»
«c1»-I'm not sure what's happening with the norwegian members of R.N.O. at the
moment. They seem to be very silent.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Romeo, Tft and Zubspace.«»
«»
«c6»SPACEBALLS:«»
«»
«c1»- This is a legendary crew which got founded back in 1989. It has had lots of
famous members, like Dark Helmet, Lone Starr, Lord Helmet, Vinnie and Major Asshole
to mention a few. It has also released lots of quality demos during this period,
most famous are probably Wayfarer, State Of The Art, RAW and 9 Fingers. The latest
years they have been even more active with Slummy as the coding-force behind all
productions. Last productions I saw was from them were Willy Bogner and
Noicejesus released at The Party 10.«»

«c6»SPECTER:«»
«»
«c1»- This is a group consisting only of norwegian members. However, most
members are double or triple-members. I'm not sure if I've seen any
productions from this group made by the members. Nevertheless,
Lost Puppy 4 and Bubble were released under the Specter label a few
weeks ago but by other people.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Chauple, Leia, Rolex and Pix.«»
«c6»SQUIRRELZ:«»
«»
«c1»- This is a very special team. In addition to being something so rare as a new
group in the norwegian scene, it also contains only females. However, I can't say
I've seen any of their productions yet. But I think they're working on an intro.
Good luck!«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Members: «c2»Alv, Leia and Peaky.«»
«»
«c6»TRIUMPH:«»
«»
«c1»-This is also a very old group. I think I got a musicdisk of them from 1989/90,
and the group might as well be a bit older than that.
They have released several demos and intros. I'm not sure if its
the original members that are releasing the productions nowadays, but Triumph
is still alive.«»

Skinner. Punisher has left them. They're planning a few productions to be
released around Mekka-Symposium.«»
«»
«c5»Well-Known Member: «c2»Skinner«»
«»
«c1»There are also a few norwegian fun-groups around, but I don't know much
about them I'm afraid.«»
