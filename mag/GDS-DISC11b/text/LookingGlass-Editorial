«c2»As always D.I.S.C. brings you some reviews. I'm afraid we haven't written
that many reviews this time. But at least we have reviewed the last issues
of the international diskmags, including "Devotion 2" released two days
ago. A new issue of the EuroChart will come in
a few days by the way, and
hopefully a new issue of ShowTime will be out in February also. Anyway, we
also have included a review of Grid2 by Nature - the winner intro of The
Party 10. In addition to that, we have some rather old but great reviews of
I-Surf/IRIS, SuperDrug/Loonies and Photocell 1X1/Anadune & Mawi. Enjoy!«»
