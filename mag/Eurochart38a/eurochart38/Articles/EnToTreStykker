»CL7:When an era ends, another era
automaticly starts. It's when
something new and refreshing invades a
huge popularity of people or just one
single person. What I am talking about
here is 1st Christmas day. A cozy
thursday afternoon just two days
before another »CL8:'The Party'» would take
place. Tomorrow night I will be
visited by some friends of mine to go
out in my hometown but first we would
socialize a bit at my place before
going into town. I had to clean things
up a bit (arghh) Yet this happening
made sure I really cleaned things up
allright. Mature as I thought I was
(and most certainly are now, anno
domini 1999) I started with fresh
motivation and after an hour or so my
room started already to look quite
acceptable for having some friends
over. We had to sit in my room
upstairs, unlike alot of other
occasions where we always sat in the
main living room, but that's the
situation when your parents live in
the same house as you :)




»CL8:The Box, We Opened It, We Came..
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:Time was rumbling in the outer limits
of my scene carreer, when I was about
to open 3 carton boxes. The contents
of the first box featured amongst
others some cables, a power pc board
for my long sold a500, 2 old disks and
an a500 sound enhancer. Nothing
ordinary so I put them back into the
box and I stored it up the attic, next
to the - ohh so famous - Nah-kolor
beach ball. Obviously I didn't want to
throw this carton box with all these
90's nostalgia away. (Am I an
emotional human being or what ? :)




»CL8:The 2nd Rearcination..
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:"Damn still two boxes to go" I thought
by myself. Yet I wanted to finish this
job of cleaning up as soon as
possible; My future wife must be
flexible what cleaning up is concerned
that's for sure.. It's not that I hate
it, but I just haven't the patience
for it I guess. And thus I decited to
open the 2nd carton box immidiately.
When it was opened I realized that
this could take a while to sort out,
since it was full of documents and
papers. 

This carton box was full of letters
and some votesheets collected in my
active period as a swapper. This from
1991 untill 1994, when I decided to
quit swapping and just hold a few long
swap mates on for the hang of it and
old times sake.. Letters from amongst
others Radavi of Effect and Killraven
of Desire (who later would be the
leader of Mystic) where in that box.
But also a printout of the first
scener I ever e-mailed. Perplex the
coder of RAW magazine. But I emailed
him trough the email address of my
brothers high school, so this did not
have any chance of continuation when I
look back at it now.. The box also
featured some letters of the first
scener I ever contacted by snail mail.
Lightforce of X-trade in Germany. Good
old times, what have the flown by..
Trash-head of Trsi letters, good old
Polisg friend, who even joined
Nah-kolor once.. Phantom of Applause
my old group and of course Sascha, my
oldskool friend in real life even
now.. Also some Jetset tag's on paper
and letters appeared from nowhere at
all.. Last but not least a banknote
from 'Martijn van Meel' or better
known as good old graphician Facet,
which he used to return some money on
my bankaccount which wasn't spend on
our trip to The Party 1993..


»CL8:The Third and Final Box..
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:The last box featured 2 empty
diskboxes. The biggest one, which can
handle around 50 3,5 inch disks was
full of stickers on the outside.. A
cool and colourfull sticker of Depth
(with a nice woman next to the logo
waering a wet t-shirt:) , the infamous
TRSI sticker with a TRSI logo by
J.O.E. A nice but huge blue & white
sticker of Animators. A disklabel of
Wicked Sensation by Trsi. Even a
sticker of the diskmagazine Suicid
published by Energy & Manitou, where
Zinkfloid or now better known as
Uyanik was once main-ed of once..
Other stickers on the box are from
Trance Inc, Orgin, Divine, TFA (the
group byhind the ASM coding program)
Xentrix, Procaz, Bonanza Crew,
Computer Shopper Show Koln 8-11
Oktober 1992. And some more.. Of 
course this box was fully tagged on,
as an old custom back in the good old
days! The small disk-box for around 10
3,5 inch disks was only tagged by Dope
of Spaceballs and me :)

»CL7:The fun part of writing this article
is actually the fact it was written in
one and a half year!! Yeay, this
wasn't at christmas last year, but
1997. I started writing the beginning
of this article, written down all the
stuff what was stored in those three
carton boxes and finished the article
just now at the end of August 1999.
Luckely I still had my diskbox with
all those stickers on it, that came in
handy. I can say the small
'get-together' at my place worked out
quite fine, and we had a nice time in
our local disco called 'Vernes' or for
some older locals around here 'The
Lantaern' It was christmas ball so
everybody was dressed up very nice
indeed.. The boxes are now closed and
went up into oblivion.. Have a nice
life! All things DO end someday.. :-)
