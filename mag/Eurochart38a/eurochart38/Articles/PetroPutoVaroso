 G&C: Hello and welcome to an
      interview for the Amiga diskmag
      "Jurassic Pack". Hey, greetings
      to you... how did you get here?

 Ty: Hello and happy easter to you. I
     came here by car because I had to
     transport all the presents for
     the AMIGA scene.

 G&C: Aren't you being missed at home?

 Ty: Mhhh... yes, but I'm often on
     tour for my beloved AMIGA. Thank
     Goodness, all members of my
     family have great understanding
     when it comes to this.

 G&C: At the moment a lot is going
      on... Phase5, Haage & Partner,
      Escena etc. What will the future
      be like, in your opinion? Who
      will dominate the market? (Also
      concerning projects like "Kosh",
      etc.)

 Ty: All AMIGA fans are welcome. They
     will all make their way but I
     think there should only be one
     direction where we all should go.
     Only united we are strong,
     separation only causes damages at
     the moment.

 G&C: How come you are so committed?
      Is that more a personal or
      business oriented engagement?

 Ty: That commitment is of a purely
     personal nature. I like to fight
     for an idea, that's the only way
     to succeed against my American
     friends. I have nothing to lose.

 G&C: At the moment I see the danger
      of separation of the already
      small Amiga family. Commitment
      that goes in the right direction
      can't be wrong. But in Poland,
      for instance, the Amiga plays a
      more important role, especially
      when it comes to the demoscene.

 Ty: Segregation? No. Kosh? I've just
     had a great meeting with J.H.
     Haage and Dietrich. We agreed
     that Phase5 will do the new G3
     board and Haage & Partner on the
     other side will develop the 68000
     emulator... so you see there is
     harmony between us!

 G&C: Haage & Partner will soon
      develop OS 3.5, unless they are
      already doing so. This is all
      very good but nothing visible to
      the public has happened for
      quite a long time. Isn't it
      already a bit too late? Many
      Amiga fans have already switched
      to other platforms because their
      Amiga was too old, for example
      to PCs.

 Ty: This is quite correct and sad but
     the hard core will be preserved
     for the existing platform. And
     the people that have left for PC
     will come back with flying
     colours as soon as we will have
     started fighting against the
     monopoly! Just wait and see.

 G&C: We will do so... We Amiga fans
      are quite used to waiting for
      something. Mhhh. What will your
      strategy be like? What will the
      marketing look like, how do you
      want to get market shares back?

 Ty: I too am accustomed to waiting
     for things. After all, Gateway
     did next to nothing during the
     past two years. They needed the
     time to explore the Amiga. Now
     they have finally understood it.
     Money is one strategy we will
     need to regain the market. And
     Gateway will invest that money.
     Secondly we need the management.
     And I think Jim Collas is the
     right person to bring back the
     Amiga to where it should have
     been for a long time, that is
     back to the top. Gateway are
     masters in marketing affairs.

 G&C: Lately Gateway has reacted and
      exchanged some leading persons,
      also to incrase the transparency
      of the company. I've asked
      myself why a company that
      produces PCs is interested in
      supporting a competing computer
      platform.

 Ty: Our operating system is the key.
     Gateway has now realized that and
     is going to take off.


 G&C: In how far do you plan to
      continue to support the
      so-called "Classic Amigas"?


 Ty: As long as I have something to
     say, always... and that will
     hopefully last for a long time.


 G&C: What do you think about
      organising an "Amiga only"
      exhibition in autumn instead of
      the Computer '99 in Cologne?

 Ty: Nothing. We simply need the other
     people in order to show them how
     good and unbeatable we are with a
     technology that hasn't had any
     novelty since 1991. I've already
     engaged myself for Cologne and I
     promise you that it will be a
     superb exhibition.

 G&C: Thanks a lot for this
      conversation and thanks to Amiga
      International for sponsoring our
      party last year (Cologne
      Conference '98). A last
      question: What are your wishes
      for the future, regarding your
      private life, your professional
      work, and the Amiga?

 Ty: Our Amiga should finally get to
     the place where it ought to be.
     That's my most important target.
     Private: Health, so that I can
     continue to fight for my beloved
     Amiga for a long time. And in the
     professional sense I wish for a
     product, a new one, something
     revolutionary with a thousand
     millions sales like we had in
     1985 ... and that satisfies all
     users.
