»CL8:Do You Remember The Time...
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL0:The decade of the 90's will be
remembered as 'our' scene years. Our
teenage years, fading into our
studying period towards and/or in our
twenty's. When the most of us are
grown up in the future we can look
back at a nice 'alternative' life
next to our real life existence.
Wasn't it all great in those exciting
years in the last decade of this
century ? Time to take a little
lookback at all the winning demos of
The Party, held as you know at the end
of each scene year since 1991 between
27-29 December..

This lookback is brought to you by
Magic of Nah-kolor, who has written
for alot of magazines during the 90's
like Upstream, Chit Chat, Rom,
Eurocharts, Seenpoint and Raw. And by
Scout of C-Lous, Appendix, TBL and
Network. Quote: "Long-time programmer
without much talent for graphics/music
although Frame/C-Lous did manage to
whipe some sense of design into me
over the years 8)" End Quote..

Scout (also known as Kalms at the IRC)
coded one of the fasted c2p till date
and some nice productions like asm95
intro, Masque (95), Kolor (96)
ill-fated, Your Astral Pilot (96),
Showbase Shape (97) Imitation None
(tg98) and he has been dealing a
little with other groups on the side
too :P


»CL8:What Are We Talking About Here ?
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:The first The Party win was ofcourse
Alcatraz with their Odessey demo. It
was a little controversal win because
many rated the 2nd place Hardwired
demo by The Silents better. However
Odessey was a movie like Relic by
Nerve Axis. But not in 3d, but all in
vektors. It was a 5 disk demo and a
very great piece of work for that
time. Scout: "I never did see that
demo, as I never had a500. Is there an
a1200 fixed version around ?"
Originality won over the hardcore code
in Hardwired.

We all do remember State Of The Art by
Spaceballs. Scout: "A great demo, it's
unlike any other demo at that time.
And since then only 9 Fingers became
close :P) Not a very typical 'demo'
demo, but it is very good if you let
go of your presumptions of what a demo
should be. When SOTA came it did break
new ground by showing something
completely different. it did feature
good 'traditional' skills, but I think
the main aspect of the demo is that it
is so much unlike anything at its
time" I totally agree with Scout.
Again originality won over hardcore
coding, this time in the 3d Demo II by
Anarchy.

The 3th The Party was won by Complex.
Again a controversal win, this time
because the new AGA demo's started
their revolution. Sanity's Arte demo
which wasn't AGA was much better for
the standarts of that time, but could
obviously not compete with AGA
machines. Scout: "I didn't get to see
Origin untill after many years and am
there for not able to put it into the
right perspective, however I saw
'Real' back then... does that count?
8))" Origin was also one of the first
AGA demo's that featured a nice 3d
world.

The Party 1994 had in my oppinion the
best demo competition ever. With a
deserved winner. Who doesn't remember
Nexus 7 by Andromeda? Kalms: "ah :)
Best demo for 1200, I'd say; the
Andromeda folks did wonders paying
attention to all aspects and details
as I recall, there are no things in
the demo that are inherently *bad* or
could-have-been-done-better.. They got
well chosen colours, transitions,
everything moves on at a given pace."

»CL0:The last The Party of the first half
of the 90's was won by CNCD. However
not that it was SOO good for that
period of time, but it had huge
objects which was very impressive in
that time. Kalms: Closer is more of a
'quick work' than the previously
winning demos mentioned -- a bit raw
and unpolished (effect - black -
effect - ...) , with the attention
paid to the major details (animated
backgrounds, flare-reflections) , the
people who did Closer oviously are
from a different design school than
e.g. Andromeda :P"

Shaft 7 by Bomb won The Party 1996.
Till date their last Amiga demo, and
the also the first Amiga demo coded by
Ben/Bomb. Kalms: "It's a brute show of
programming skills and graphical
talent; It is indeed wrapped up as a
full demo, but I would personally have
appreciated it if it had more of
variety than the static-world 3d
scenes.."

For the 2nd time since The Party 1991,
two 'huge' groups set their ambitions
aside and cooperated on a cooperation
demo. Haujobb & Scoopex used there
combined quality's to produce My
Kingdom. And immidiatly won The Party
1997! Kalms: "My Kingdom, I like that
one (opinions vary among my friends
though :)) It's a combination of the
music (I like the particular choice of
instruments done for the tune), and
the effects that fit in quite okay.
The demo has some ups/downs (a few of
the textures/screens do not appeal to
me), but the total demo I find very
enjoyable. As always, it could have
done with some transitions. 8)"

The last Edition of The Party was won
by Scoopex with their 2nd Alien demo.
(See the *live* report of the TP'98
demo compo somewhere else in this
Magical Moments..) After Nerve Axis
their Relic demo, again a demo with a
'Movie Plot' Kalms: "Hmm I have a bit
mixed emotions about the Alien2 demo.
The 3d engine is okay (but I believe
that Boogeyman can do better than
+that on a 060); The 3d art +
texturing is probably the best done on
Amiga so far (although I don't know
what happened to the *animation* of
the characters -- they're supposed to
be mo-capped but I still think the
animation is not very realistic) Okay,
perhaps they didn't mo-cap the alien?"

»CL0:Shaft7 »CL1:- »CL0:5 Points »CL1:Kalms:»CL0: "it's good technically but I don't think that a 
         mainly technology demonstration makes an *enjoyable* demo)

»CL0:Alien2»CL1: -»CL0: 5 Points »CL1:Kalms:»CL0: "They had good intentions and put a lot of work into 
         it but I don't know why the end result is like it is.. 
         Perhaps they used 030 engine only in it -> could've looked 
         better technically on the 060, perhaps they packed the 
         animation data too tightly and losing serious amounts of 
         information.."

»CL0:Odyssey »CL1:-»CL0: 6 Points »CL1:Magic:»CL0: For it's time very enjoyable. Though the disk-
          swapping was kinda boring. I still remember seeing it
          time and time again when I used to come home from school:)
