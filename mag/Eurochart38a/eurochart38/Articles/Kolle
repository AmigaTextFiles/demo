»CL7:Hello dear »CL8:Eurochart» readers.. For the
5th (or 6th ? I lost count :) I am
supporting The Official Eurohart in a
row. A pretty nice achievement if I
may say so.. This time again a Magical
Moments corner as in the previous two
issues, I hope you like them as much I
liked writing them filling up some
gaps in my spair time :) I am
supporting this legendary charts
magazine for as long as I can remember
I hope you will do the same for the
next issue goddamnit!! :) By the way,
Assembly has gone by again, and some
nice releases have merged from this
party. The most terrible news what
party's is concerned is that there
will not be an IntelOutside party in
Poland. What used to be a good source
for some (or alot) releases from
Polish groups. Maybe other party's
this year will make up for this ?







»CL8:The Summer of 1999..
»CL9:»SML:--------------------------------------
»CL7:Yeay another Summer has passed. I had
a nice holiday outside Holland, a nice
time at the local Beach where I live.
Nice party's, and ofcourse some
writing. Another remarkable happening
was the fact I saw the new Star Wars
Movie, it's different but it's GOOD!
By the way did you all know Oktober is
a good month to go on holiday to Spain
for a week ? :)








»CL8:A Happy Amiga Scenish 1999
»CL9:»SML:--------------------------------------
»CL7:The scene just lives on. Who cares how
the past looked like ? I certainly
don't.. But isn't the Official
Eurochart for this goal and/or need ?
:) The Summer is almost over, and
AGAIN (yes I am still not getting
tired of writing this every year) we
are heading to the last part of the
year, where the whole scene will enjoy
The Party. Can we get some great
compo's finally atleast this year
overthere ? Get working Scene!

The next Magical Moments will soon be
finished. This because my great group
mate Darkus joined up, and we will try
to make the new Magical Moments even
better. Atleast we have a great
article from Majic Mushroom, who
interviewed a legendary coder from the
real OLD days.. But wait and see in
the next Magcial Moments corner.. Any
magazine out there who wants it ??

»CL7:The essence of writing a column is..?
My own ego-stimulating ? Maybe the
fact that in real life people find it
interesting to read an column by a
known personality. But what is a known
personality ? To be known you have to
have a group of people to establish
your name in. Get voting! Enough votes
ensure the continuation of the Offical
Eurochart! Btw download issue 19
somewhere to see an old photo of me in
the Gallery :) (Taken Warsawa/Poland
in 1994 :)
