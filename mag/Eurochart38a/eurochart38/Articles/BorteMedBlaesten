»CL0:Today Magical Moments met one of the
best coders in the Amiga scene; Offa
of The Black Lotus managed to release
within a one year period four great
demos together with his friend
Equalizer. Offa: "Hi! I am Offa part
of TBL in Sweden. My biggest demos on
Amiga were Tint, Goa, Glow and
Captured Dreams." A high quality serie
of demos produced by Mattias Gruvman
which is Offa's real name. Sadly all
things come to an end one day and Offa
started to work for a software company
after Captured Dreams was released. "I
started with demos about 9 years ago
but right after The Gathering 1997 I
started work for Digital Illusions in
Gothenburg." Offa comments. 

»CL8:Amiga Scene Past Tense
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Offa has a great time looking back on
his scene adventures. "Making new
friends both in TBL and the rest of
the scene. I've had great fun on both
small coding meetings aswell as big
parties." Offa comments and continues
"The best parties have been the
Assembly were we met the allways crazy
finns."

»CL1:Magic:»CL0: "What about TBL nowdays? Did
       you see their production
       released after Captured Dreams?
       And are you still in contact ?"

»CL3:Offa:»CL2:  "Yeah I've seen all of them. I
       meet the other TBL'ers that
       live here in Gothenburg almost
       every weekend. We plan a TBL
       meeting in Holland this
       +summer. (Since we got half the
       members there)"

»CL1:Magic:»CL0: "You once stated you would make
       a comeback when a better demo
       as Captured Dreams would be
       released. We have a new no1:
       'Relic by Nerve Axis' Can we
       stick to your promise?"
       

»CL3:Offa:»CL2:  "Hmm I haven't seen Relic.. But
       I guess it won't happen that I
       sit in front of an Amiga again.
       I don't remember the name of
       the demo I saw last I guess I'm
       not following Amiga anymore. A
       nice PC emulator would be nice
       since I don't got a fast amiga
       connected to the net here at
       the office. I've seen some of
       the latest PC demos though, and
       they seldom have the same
       'feeling' as a good Amiga demo
       has."


»CL1:Magic:»CL0: "Back in 1996 the scene was
       surprised to see TBL using
       graphics by good old Facet, as
       he didn't represent the level
       of Danny, Rodney and Louie. Why
       TBL still used it? Because of
       his legendary name? How is the
       contact with the famous Dutch
       TBL'ers?"

»CL3:Offa:»CL2:  "I liked his graphics.. And as
       allways we used all graphics we
       got since graphicians are lazy
       by nature :) Facet and Supernao
       show up now and then. Not even
       the TBLers in Holland know
       their whereabouts all the time.
       Danny should be back in Holland
       since he left Eidos in London."




»CL8:Sweden Won! (The Song Festival)
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:Ironically the evening before the
interview Sweden won the Song Festival
in Israel! A Pamela Anderson
look-a-like doing Abba :) There wasn't
a force on earth to congratulate Offa
and ask for a comment.. Offa: "Trust
me.. If you knew which other
contenders competed, Sweden was best
as it was. And btw the whole festival
is lame :)"

»CL8:The Future Will Look Like ?
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL0:"I'm still at Digital Illusions and
had one big release sofar (Motorhead,
arcadish driving game on PC and PSX).
I'm currently working on a game called
Rally Masters." Offa comments. But he
might comeback on PC.. "Well.. since
I'm used to PC as platform it would be
PC and windows based. And then it's
atleast possible. Me and Equalizer
have actually discussed it.. But we
haven't got any further than that! I
can mention that Louie has been
involved in the making of a tech demo
on the newest Matrox card. (with some
other guys at the office) Take a look
at www.matrox.com/g400/3d_gaming/demo"

»CL7:There is a small light burning anyway
in a office downtown Gothenborg in
Sweden! But why focus on games when
alot of them are pirated. Also on the
Playstation! Offa: "Well I hope people
buy games if they like them. And still
if you compare piracy on PSX vs. PC. I
think it's alot more on PC."
»CL1:Magic:»CL0: "Well I hope you sell alot of
       copies anyway! Thank you for
       this nice interview.."

»CL3:Offa:»CL2:  "You're Welcome.."
