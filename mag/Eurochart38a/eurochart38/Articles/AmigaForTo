»CL0: In times when pessimism takes control
 over  nearly every  sceners  mind, in
 these   days   when   every   founded
 information,  not  like  those rumors
 from the AMIGA Inc.  kittchen,  is  a
 message for an anniversary, I thought
 to  write a little article for one of
 the most known scenemags,  if not THE
 most known one, about some news those
 really  show,  not  only  talk about,
 that our beloved girl friend is still
 alive,  or so to say:  will kick non-
 believer`s ass!

 Since the december of  1998 are there
 two  new  magazines  out  to  be sold
 in   germany   which   are   strongly
 orientated  to  topics concerning the
 AMIGA.
 At  first  is there `AMIGA Fever` - a
 gamer`s zine, that was really  needed
 here because every know gamezine from
 the past has been dropped,  so it was
 a  good  sign  to  be  able  to  read
 reviews of last years games and  pre-
 views  of  new  ones  like the ported
 `Wet` - a runner on the PC - again.
 This one looked a bit  like hand-made
 and  it  was.  More  a fanzine than a
 commercial paper,  but  with  a  very
 professional    layout    and    nice
 articles;  only  the screenshots  and
 photos were often a bit ugly.

 At second is there `amigaOS` - a user
 oriented   paper   with   a   lot  of
 interviews    of    leading     AMIGA
 personalities,  both  old legends and
 newcomers.  This one concentrates its
 topics  on  hardware  related  news &
 coding workshops and  articles  about
 user software like monzoompro, Linux,
 Pagestream,  Fantastic Dreams,  Amiga
 Writer   and   NetConnect.   A   very
 professional  magazine  that  is  not
 only  made  for  the  AMIGA, but also
 created  with  it,  if you belive the
 logo on the top of its front page. It
 has  been  presented  at first to the
 public  at  `Cologne`98` and  it  can
 beat  the  old,  legendary  AmigaPlus
 (a+), that I really loved by the way,
 in every category.

 Now  may  ask  some of you by reading
 this why I write about these news  in
 a  scenemag.  The  reason is not only
 to tell you that it`s going  on  with
 the  machine  we really love from the
 heart,  but  also to tell you how the
 scene can be discovered now from  the
 public amigian community.  From issue
  »PIC:GreenEye96x105»                two on  reports this
                  paper about the life
                  of and in the scene,
                  a project  that  was
                  already  invented by
                  the a+,  but  wasn`t
                  accepted   by   it`s
                  readers,  except me,
                  but   they    didn`t
                  published  me letter
                  to the editor.   You
                  can read there a lot
 about parties  like tp8  &  mekkasym,
 diskmags   -   the speaking  tubes of
 the scene (original title!)  and  the
 scene`s presentation at the !nternet.

 In  this  way  is also  the  `normal`
 amigian  able to read news and trends
 about  the  people  that built up the
 AMIGA in the past and surely will  in
 the future; and you have to know that
 the  writers of those articles didn`t
 only let the scene shine bright  over
 all,  but with a bit of critics about
 the less  activities of legends  like
 TRSI,  Fairlight  and  Virtual Dreams
 and the  comments  about  how  coders
 demonstrate  how  to  make astounding
 things with  the  AMIGA,  they showed
 their knowledge about  what the scene
 stands for, still today.
 After  the  closing of `CU AMIGA` are
 these two new zines more than a light
 at the end of the  tunnel,  that  has
 been  darken  by  Commodore  and  not
 illuminated  neither  by  AT  nor AI,
 but  rather  a  spotlight  that could
 lead us to new borders and behind. In
 its  last  issue joined `AMIGA Fever`
 and they are now one big  paper  that
 informs all  german  amigians  with a
 wide range of topics and editors  who
 know what they are writing about.
 Well,  the  scene will surely not end
 now being  a  mysterious  underground
 tradition,  but it won`t be a unknown
 subculture  any  longer,   rather   a
 ground for the art of the future like
 Curt Cool wrote about in EC #37.
