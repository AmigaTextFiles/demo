»CL7:Re-apperance trough the Gates of the
infinite Amiga screen window hooked up
to your mighty Amiga computer. Make
your imaginative brainwaves ready to
enter the virtual world of Amiga
Scene. The selective perception
towards the individual way of
receiving of what you call: 'The Amiga












Scene'. Don't keep your eyes shut!
Feel what's really happening. See the
bigger perspective... Realise the need
(towards yourself) of what we all know
as 'THE Amiga Scene..' Free your mind,
don't neglect your roots, keep it
going, yet in another priority.. 

»CL7:Welcome to the new Magical Moments
dear readers! With the 21st century
around the corner, this is one of the
best Magical Moment corner till date!
New is that fact that friends of mine
also can contribute. And this
time Alvin of ex-Generation fame who
recently joined Nah-kolor has
contributed with an fabulous article
about and with Rokdazone/Endzeit!

»CL7:Of course this is also the thirth time
in succesion that Magical Moments is
presented itself in the Official
Eurocharts! And we (Curt and I) hope
that there will be plenty more
occasions. This Magical Moments is
dedicated to Dreamer of Nah-kolor, who
recently surprised me with a
phone-call and a visit to my home,
here in good old Holland. Respect to
him, as we first meeted in August 1994
when we were still 'kids' ;)

Contrary to the popular believe also a
small 'thank you' to Dope and Infant
of Lemon. (or Spaceballs) fame, who
were so nice to send me a postcard
from Paris where they were on holiday
this summer.. 

There are times the scene tends to let
go of me, but luckily internet andmy
group(mates) let me hang in there.
Though the time I spend is really ata
minimum, this Magical Moments proves I
still got what it takes I suppose..

»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:Work, Freetime, (birthday) party's,
Holiday's, Woman, Child(eren),
Goingout for Dinner, A long weekend
away from home... And than... Scening

Yes, it's the way we all gonna end up
I am afraid (exceptions ignored) But
for the time being I wish you a nice
life, and untill the next Episode of
Magical Moments..
