path you take your leaving your
legacy.."

»CL0:I am writing since 1992 (for a dutch
diskmag), or since 1993 for english
Amiga based diskmags if you like.. I
have seen 'it' all more than once,
witnessed the 'scene cycle' more than
once. Meeted the most prominent
sceners from the first half of the
90's. Some became my closest friends
for a period in time. Some grew to the
most prominent sceners the scene is
glad to have in this last year of the
century. (and even beyond I suppose..)
Trough my writings I analyzed the
scene in almost every aspect. Is there
still a question left for me to
answer? And yet I am still around! (As
this feeling intruded me already 3
years ago.. :-)


»CL7:These words are dedicated to all the
scene lovers. The ones with a passion
for the scene, though the eager has
floated away, yet the hobby remains.
Don't criticize! Enhance, enjoy! For
the (active and/or retired) writers an
editors out there I present to you an
overview of my work. Please note this
is only about 60% of all articles I
have ever written. I could not find
all headlines back, especially the
older ones.. Has one writer in the
scene written so much, in so many
different ways? I don't think so! Are
there many writers left who are still
active for such long time period? I
don't think so! Respect please! A wise
man once said: "Don't use your energy
on people who are (often) criticizing
on you.." And right he is!

»CL8:Please have this notice..
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:Trough the years I was Main-editor of
all the issues of THING magazine. In
all THING issues together are more
than 50 articles. In the Eurocharts
issue 19 we had a 5th spot. Which was
not bad if you take in notice that is
was a diskmagazine comming from Poland
(except for me ofcourse:) in that
time. I was main-editor from Chit Chat
issue 14 and 15, Showtime issue 4 and
Retro issue 4. Ofcourse in the
magazines are far more articles than
presented here in this list. This also
counts for Upstream issue 11 which was
never released and the articles went
to RAW issue 9. Where I was co-editor
from. Buzz issue 8 featured the first
Magical Moments corner (in 1995) and
later Retro4, Eurocharts 36 and 37
also had one. And ofcourse since the
37th issue of the EC I am co-editor
from this legendary chart.

Another remarkable archievement was
the fact I was the one who was behind
the first AGA diskmagazine in the
scene. This was Chit Chat issue 15 by
Mirage. With special AGA code by
Protec of Mirage and a splashing AGA
lay-out by no-one less than All-star
graphician Danny! And ofcourse some
AGA cliparts by various graphicians..






»CL8:Greetings to..
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:I want to greet all the writers I have
the pleasure to talk to and or meeted
during the years. Especially the ones
I cooperated with on writing articles.
(In the list these articles are marked
with the '*' symbol.) I cooperated
with writers like Mop, RokDaZone,
Fishwave, Blitter, Mount Astro,
Sixpack, Rawstyle and Sane. My best
greetings to the all of you.. I am
sure there are more articles which I
did together with another writer but
my mEmory isn't that good these days
:) Also greetings to Lord Helmet
(TP'94 was the best, and Nexus 7 also
still:) Retep and Tomcat (The Vernes
was pritty cool all those times..)
Curt Cool (The everlasting student
hehe) Wade (The lucky writer who can
write in his country's language:)
Norman, your Polish diskmagazine
rules, I hope I can support it again
in the future. And ofcourse to Adok,
the editor of the best PC diskmagazine
around at this moment. And to all the
rest I forgot..
