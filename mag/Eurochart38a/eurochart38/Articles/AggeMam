»CL0:For a while now he has been the new
number one graphician on the Amiga
scene. And he is a huge star on the PC
scene as well. Made of Bomb, or known
in real life as Carlos Pardo, who was
born on January 24th 1977 in
Argentina. Made:»CL1: "I'm actualy working
on an advertising company, doing some
design and web stuff nowdays.."» In
this interview Made will tell us about
his new slideshow project, his view on
other graphicians, and finally he
will shine a light on how he sees his
future on the demo scene.. Enjoy!


»CL8:The Amiga Scene versus Artcore 2..
»CL9:--------------------------------------

»CL1:Magic:»CL0: "What do you think of the Amiga
       scene anno domini 1999 ?"

»CL3:Made:»CL2:  "I don't think the Amiga scene
       is maturing so fast.. Year by
       year I have seen the amiga
       demogroups leaving, and the
       improvement can't be so
       spectacular on a computer like
       a 680xx based Amiga compared to
       a pentium with hardware, 3d
       acceleration based engines.
       That's why I think, Amiga is
       showing it's limits, no
       artistic limitations, but
       hardware ones.. That's one
       reason why Bomb doesn't plan
       anything anymore on Amiga,
       except for Artcore 2
       slideshow."

»CL1:Magic:»CL0: "Artcore 2 is an ambitious
       project for sure.. Can you tell
       us more about this project ?"
       
»CL3:Made:»CL2:  "It's a big project, with alot
       of people involved. On the PC
       side expect some surprising
       stuff. We really want to
       improve, technicaly and
       visualy. That's why we are
       going to do some cooperations
       with others french groups and
       add fresh people in BOMB on PC.
       I started Artcore 2 as a
       project a few months ago,
       asking lots of graphicians to
       participe with non released
       graphics. The trip is to show
       people, what's art on a
       computer, what's bitmap work,
       and who we are! On Amiga the
       coding will be done by Antibyte
       (Hello :) on Pc coding by Skal
       and Excstay (BOMB & NOMAD),
       musics is done by
       Traven/Lluvia/Djam for the time
       being.."

»CL1:Magic:»CL0: "Who will be the graphicians
       involved in Artcore 2 ?"

»CL3:Made:»CL2:  "The guest-graphicians are:
       Lazur, Destop, Danny, Gelmir,
       Frost, Jamon, Titan, Mr. Spliff
       and Niko.."



»CL8:Made's Oppion
about his colleque graphician's..
»CL9:--------------------------------------

»CL1:Magic:»CL0: "Could you please give your
       oppinion about the following
       graphicians: Lazur, Danny, Fame
       and Destop; Maybe you can add
       few more you want to mention
       for yourself.."

»CL3:Made:»CL2:  "Lazur: Definitely one of the most
       patient and precise graphician
       in the demoscene. I really love
       his sweet palets and his
       landscapes. He really improved
       in the definition of
       High-resolution on Amiga. The
       only thing I hate in his work
       is his way he paint people or
       faces. Not the same level as
       the rest."
 
       "Danny: I love this guy, but
       there is not very much of his
       work around, not an
       'interesting' graphician. He
       improved in the "how to seduce
       party people" style.. Painting
       the most impressive collection
       of nude babes, boobs and
       vicious faces :)"

       "Fame: Nice guy too. A rude way
       to dither. With lots of pixels
       and a really hard shading, but
       a real way to express the force
       in his colors and choice of
       scenes. Interesting work!"

       "Destop: A guy who amazed me by
       his ideas. Not really
       technician, but a psychedelik
       painter. He has one of the best
       palets choice I think I think
       he has been really influenced
       by RA's work, but...who hasn't
       ? He is an awsome man with good
       ideas."

       "Ra: The most interesting
       painter of the demoscene. A
       real digital artist who
       inspired most of the actual
       graphicians, the father of a
       style, HIS style."

       "Uno: Another oldschool guy.
       One of the first graphician to
       introduce sharp antialias and
       kick-ass shading which was rare
       stuff in the beginning of the
       90's.."


»CL8:Made, and his future on the scene..
»CL9:--------------------------------------

»CL7:In my talk with Made, I was intriqued
by this young men awareness of his life
at this particular point in time.
After dominating the scene with alot
of pictures, you could say he should
be 'burned out' by now. But nothing is
far from this truth. »CL3:Made:»CL2: "I never
wanted to dominate anything, I'm just
too buzy with life things. Childhood
has past, I have to work, my passion
can take most of my time now, but my
motivation is the same as the first
day so expect some work from me for a
long time to come. And he concludes:
"Greetings to the all passionated
people, who share and improve with the
scene, and give to us lots of
enjoyement day by day, since years,
for years to come.."
