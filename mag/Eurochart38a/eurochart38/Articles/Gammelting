»CL7:Welcome to »CL8:Scene TV!» The new virtual
home Demo Scene channel broadcasting
everything from demos to interviews
with known sceners. This station
innitially started out of hobby'ism
but has grown to a full global network
for sceners only. Catch us at
http://www.scene-tv.com 

As every year since the beginning of
this decade, The Party was held in
Denmark again in 1998. Trough the
internet sceners who didn't visit for
what reason or another could
'virtually' be present. And so I was
for the 3th time in succession hooked
to the net most of the time at 27-29
December since my last visit
originating from 1995. And I (we) were
in luck. I meeted my old contact
Rawstyle of Lego on the net, who was
actually sitting infront of the big
screen at TP'98.. (Do you remember
Rawstyle as co-ed from the infamous
RAW issue 9 ? :) Anyway Rawstyle was
willing to report to us *live* the
Amiga Demo Competition.. Fasten your
seatbelts, here we go!


»CL8:I Used To Glance Beyond The Stars..
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:Many interesting sceners were reading
Rawstyle's report. The topic at
#demoscene was ofcourse "rawstyle
reports *LIVE* The first entry of the
demo competition just ended when
suddenly another old contact of mine
entered the channel. 

»CL1:*** muffler
(~muffler@CCCXXXIX.odyn.saunalahti.fi)
has joined channel #demoscene

»CL7:Somone asked if it was really true
what the topic said. »CL0:Rawstyle: "Yes
i'm trying to do some live reportage"
In the mean time Muffler got's an
operator status. 

»CL1:*** Mode change "+o muffler" on
channel #demoscene by worm_

»CL7:The second entry starts. »CL0:"#2: juusto
2" by "thain (ind.)" Rawstyle
comments. While Muffler says: "worm
thanks!" I was really curious of
Muffler also attented The Party 1998,
but unfortunately "Nope" was his
answer. In the mean time muffler
discovers that the demo compo is
reported life..

Muffler: "#2 demo ???"

Rawstyle: "Yes, it said artifical
people. Isn't that a group?!? :) They
just noticed themselves 'design? who
cares' Yes it's rather boring.."

Rawstyle: "#3: take a bath with tulou
2 by Tulou"

»CL7:Jamie of Skarla who was also present
at the #demoscne channel with as
nickname 'SKARLA' knew that Oxyron
would compete at The Party 1998.
"Rawstyle, the oxyron demo was good?"
He asks. "Was okay. nothing special I
find it" Rawstyle comments.

»CL0:Rawstyle: "#3 is more a slideshow demo
.. pictures from a weekend trip and
something ah #3 just over.." 

Rawstyle: "#4: substral by ephidrena.
Oh no, that's #5 ??? Oh.. #4:
"Wildlife" by "Pink / Abyss" coming
up!" and continues: "module by
Pink+moby !!! code by pink and kustom,
graphics by cyclone,judas and pink."

»CL7:Jamie of Skarla who was also at the
channel as SKARLA suddenly woke up;
"Moby rules! Pink too" he comments.
Psycho of Endzeit comments: "Moby is
back.. =) lets hope he's as good as he
said he was bad.."

»CL0:Rawstyle, still commenting the Abyss
demo: "There are balls jumping on a
plane which is tiled, the tiles go
down when a ball jumps over them.
Can't describe :)"

»CL7:All of the sudden another known scener
entered the channel, the infamous
Hollywood also of ex-RAW fame. It's a
darn reunion :)

»CL1:*** h0l (m0n0@userk928.uk.uudial.com)
has joined channel #demoscene

»CL0:Rawstyle continues: "Oh an interesting
tunnel, a cool pic from judas, Abyss
logo zooming in 'scrollers are
outdated...... .. .' Nice gfx! A
scroller and some picture moving
around in the background.. Three
layers... four.. five... MANY! :)
Another great pixelpic. Now the
end-scroller. Yes it's kind of
old-school.. the abyss style :) I'm
waiting for MS propaganda in the
end-scroller :DD Haha greetz to
'Rawstyle and his MS team' :) 'his MS
team' :DD ohh.. Cool demo! just
over.."

Hollywood: "hi all.. phoenix, magic,
rawstyle :)"

»CL1:* h0l should have been at the party
but changed his mind at last minute
doh :)

»CL0:Rawstyle: "#5: Substral by Ephidrena"

»CL1:* magic^nah waits for Floppy demo :)))
* SKARLA waits for Scoopex demo:)))

»CL0:Rawstyle: "This is a chunky industrial
breakbeat pseudotechno demo again :)
Like warping zooming light effects
here, Ra-style EPH logo, cool text
writer, one-line textwriter lots of
light effects which build up the text
it's okay. it's new-style. I rather
like more of the abyss-style demos but
anyway :) okay, over.." 

»CL7:The people in the channel really
appriciate Rawstyles new function he
lay upon himself. »CL0:Hollywood: "Thanks
for the commentary.. real professional
:)"

Rawstyle: "#6: Dualcrew & Shining by
Adam. Hmm i'd think rather vice-versa
:)"

Hollywood: "damn, i wish i'd felt
better and used my planeticket in some
ways.. The Party might have ruled. :("

»CL7:Suddenly music giant Muffler wakes up
by hearing the name of one of his
groups.. »CL0:Muffler: "dcs demo now?"

Rawstyle: "bla bla DCS demo looks like
intro stuff, don't know what to say
about this demo :) Like the credits
take a long time to be presented in
this demo :) Inbetween some
medium-quality texmap-engine. There's
a envmapped vectorball with spikes ..
lots of spikes... Looks nice when its
rotating.. Like doesn't someone else
want to take over reporting? :)) #6 is
over"

Skarla: "Strange style for dcs demo ?
It's always the same 3000 people for
300 sceners.."

»CL7:Suddenly a somewhat higher electric
stream gathers around the #demoscene
channel. The demo everybody knew about
before The Party started was about to
put on the big screen.. A certain
Finnish musician at #demoscene finally
got jerked off.. :)

»CL0:Rawstyle: "#7: Alien 2 by Scoopex"

Muffler: "YEAH!"

Rawstyle: "I heard they gotta cut the
endpart because otherwise they would
have reached the 6mb limit. Credits:
Muffler, Virgill, Nomad, Boogeyman
Metal Designer, Antibyte"

[Teo]: "Muffler music by you?"

Muffler: "Yup, but i was in a fucking
hurry. If there's not the end part,
then there's not Virgill's module. I
made three modules. Intro and 2 main
tunes, and Virgill made the module for
the end scroller."

Rawstyle, hearing the music comments:
"Sounds good! :-)"

SKARLA: "Muffler and Virgill =
powerful music :)"

Phoenix: "Antibyte is still around?
damn.."

Rawstyle: "Two planet-like objects in
space, camera looks around, not much
happens some space-ship comes around
and vanishes into infinity again.
Title pic the space ship from the
'Alien' movie from inside in a vector
engine. Door opens, cat enters, the
hypersleeping chambers opened. Some
unrelated effects now.. Some person
comes; Well animated though. Engine
shows the interior of some other part
of the ship, you know this when you
know the movie, btw :) The guy enters
and searches for the cat... (you know
this scene, do you?) The REAL alien
grabs him from behind. Now ripley
comes.. I think it's gotta be ripley
:) Again some unrelated effect. we had
that one already :)"

Muffler: "It's a pity we didn't have
time to include the sound fx for those
(it will come in later version)"

SKARLA: "Muffler: describe the
music!!!! :)"

Muffler: "Main2 got the unfashioned
303 lines (oldie ones) done mainly
because of lack of time (from old 303
samples)"

Rawstyle: "uhh ohh the alien hunts the
spectator :)) It doesn't look THAT
good i think; Ripley runs away; Fires
at the alien. Again some unrelated
effect :) But looks real good.. some
view right into a lightsource.. A
pulsating light source."

SKARLA: "Good unrelated effect?"

Rawstyle: "Skarla, yep :) Black screen
now. loading? :) Demo goes on. hmm
whats this? another big, big hall.
Looks cool.. the texmapping isn't
really good, but the details of the
scene are okay; Anyway Ripley is in
there, now again the gangway with the
Alien. Another unrelated effect :)=))
Voxelscape-like landscape wrapped onto
a stick.. you know that one, for sure.
Can't describe better. This lightource
at the end of the tunnel effect. Hmm..
Showdown time between ripley & alien
now :) Ripley escapes in the small
daughtership attached to the bottom of
the mothership. Like in the movie.
Well it ought to be Sigourney Weaver..
It doesn't look exactly like her, but
you do recognize the scenes from the
movie :) Guess what happens? The big
ship explodes? YES it does :)) oh am I
good :D"

SKARLA: "ahaha"

Rawstyle: "People scream.. great demo!
yes, Alien is over. Some strange guy
standing on the stage now, The front
of the hall is crowded now, btw.. #8:
Power by Robo.. hmm :)"

SKARLA: "aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh where I
can get the Scoopex demo??????????????"

Rawstyle: "Some stick penetrating a
woman and stuff. like not nice and all
:) Yeah okay forget that one! Now some
artifical penis :) and a picture
'BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED' lol :)" 

Rawstyle: "#9: 'raybong' / 'loveboat'"

Muffler: "loveboat, love is MY boat:)"

Rawstyle: "Loveboat, cool name. some
3d lissajous light bobs in the
background still no.." Suddenly
Rawstyle quitted typing. A small
interference hits the #demoscene while
everybody present is waiting untill
the next lines to appear.. Than
Rawstyle says: "okay, the demo is
over.."

Rawstyle: "#10: 'swift' by 'IRIS' Can
be good. Graphics by bandy, bifrost,
judas and adam. Music by tricktrax.
Iris logo, cool pics in this demo. An
envmapped torus emitting light rays..
Looks great! 2d bumpmapping..
standard; another great pic from
judas. Envmapping again. rather
complex object, and rather low
resolution.."

Rawstyle: "#11: "QAPMOC" by "Nose
Bears" It's like SLOW, not recognizing
what this is gonna be... Uhhhh coded
on a 030 and not 060-compatible :) Yes
it's slow... It's this dtack bug
people have when coders don't take
care :) Demo over..."

Rawstyle: "#12: 'Danish danish danish
(don't know)" by "Sumpen" ... Don't
know the title :D 'IRIS SUX' .. oh :)
Latest effect in the background. A
dotball :)) Some bill gates is homo
joke ... don't know.. Okay, forget
this demo :) > irix sux, but iris? :)"

Rawstyle: "#13: again some danish
stuff.. didn'T get the exact data.
It's loonies !! a 2-hour production:
'julemandens sidste ferie!' okay crap
msx.. #13 over. oh boy, am i happy."

Rawstyle: "END OF COMPETITION"

»CL7:And there we were at the end of what
should have been THE competition of
1998. The organizers failed to play's
Floppy's demo which competed lateron
in 1999 at Astrosyn.. Of course as
soon as Rawstyle announced the
competition was over a lot of people
on the channel had questions..

»CL0:SKARLA: "Rawstyle: Scoopex will win
?"

Muffler: "Rawstyle, what demo you
think will win ?"

Magic^Nah: "Floppy's Demo Didnt
Compete ?!?!?!??!"


»CL8:Epiloque
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Rawstyle: "My resumee: lame compo, few
good releases. some nice new effects.
Muffler, Oxyron, Scoopex and Abyss are
the only real candidates to win. And
perhaps some others I forgot. I was
busy writing stuff into this channel
instead of enjoying the demos :)"

SKARLA "Thanks for all rawstyle.."


»CL7:And so also the broadcast at the
SceneTV station ended, ofcourse after
some commercials from their sponsors.
Suddenly I see a face appear who
apprently looks like... Bill Gates?!? 
"Hmmmm.."
