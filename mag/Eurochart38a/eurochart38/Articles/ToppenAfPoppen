»CL0:Finally, it has happened. The moment,
that a lot of Danish sceners have
yerned for during a couple of years.
»CL1:Dansktoppen» is back. »CL1:Loonies» have
ensured that the national Danish chart
is once again rolling. 
»CL1:Dansktoppen» was the chart that inpired
the»CL1: Norwegians» to make »CL1:Norsktoppen».
About two years ago, »CL1:Pearl»/»CL1:Parasite»
however gave up on the idea of having
some pure Danish articles together
with a little chart. 
I, among many others really enjoyed
reading this mag which reached it onto
the eighth issue. I was therefore more
than willing to give the source from
this very mag to Loonies, when they
asked for people to provide source for
the Dansktoppen. 

The result is a design that is quite
Eurochart inspired (whether people
like it or not!). However, the
stat-section has been removed from the
chart, aa well as the gallery.
Furthermore, only the top five in ten
different categories are to be found
in the chart. 

The magsection contains a lot of old
Danish texts written by various
ex-sceners, as well as some people

still alive and kicking. There has
also been room for a quite hilarious
poem section (IMHO, all poem sections
are quite funny - no offence :-). All
in all, Dansktoppen 9 is worth reading
a couple of times. 

Of course, as a Danish scener, I was
disappointed not finding myself in the
charts (except my 4K, »CL1:str8», which
first of all doesn't quite deserve
being on the chart and secondly is NOT
a Scoopex production!), but I'm
certainly more motivated than in a
long time to make an effort thereby
acheiving some ranks in the chart.

Way to go, »CL1:Loonies». Now, all, we Danes
need is the rebirth of »CL1:Sound». Could
»CL1:Shayera»/»CL1:Spoon» please get going? ;-)
