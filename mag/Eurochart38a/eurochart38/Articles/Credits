»CL9:»SML:--------------------------------------

»CL1:(as credited by an incredibly
hangovered Curt Cool - after 3 days of
tutoring (torturing?) new students -
which basically involves telling them 
a lot of stuff about university while
getting totally drunk in the process).»CL0:

The code was (as usual) made by
»CL1:Quedax/Depth» - and this time a couple
of small bugs was corrected by »CL1:Cytron»
who also wrote the editorial and
assembled what you're reading now.
That aside, he went to »CL1:Mexico» and
packed to go to »CL1:Switzerland» for a year
- with his Amiga, to ensure your
reading pleasure for yet some time.

As the other main editor, »CL1:Curt Cool»
(myself) wrote some articles, counted
some votes, made the gallery section
and collected all kinds of support.

»CL1:Co-editors» are »CL1:Magic/Nah-Kolor» who (as
usual) came up with his great »CL1:"Magical
Moments"» section and »CL1:Bucko/Depth» who
also wrote a lot of articles.

As our loyal article supporters,
»CL1:Darkus/Nah-Kolor», »CL1:Zito/Zetec», »CL1:Ghandy» &
»CL1:Chavez/Faith», »CL1:Troda/Pegas» &
»CL1:Blueberry/Efreet&Loonies» & »CL1:Ransom/IRIS»
kindly submitted their support.




»CL0:The design which is the same as in
issue 37 was still made by
»CL1:Artie/Embassy» - we promised that we
would use his design twice, but next
time, we will have a new one -
promise!

The titlepicture was drawn by
»CL1:judaS/Endzeit&IRIS».

The clip-art (of which one was in the
process of making Eurochart 37 but
found for this issue) was made by
»CL1:Seven Eleven/Ascend» (sorry for not
writing - I will return, I promise!),
»CL1:judaS/Endzeit&IRIS» & »CL1:Revi/Whelpz».

The music was composed by »CL1:Trip»
(admittedly a long time ago) and
»CL1:Roz/Rave Network Overscan».
Thanks must also go to all our loyal
supporters, voters, vote collectors,
friends, families, breweries - I am
too trashed to be able to mention you
all, but we will not forget you - and
we hope you won't forget us.
