»CL4:             by Curt Cool

»CL0:The reason for the delay of this issue
is that »CL1:Cytron» has been to »CL1:Mexico» with
his sister during the summer, and as
he assembles, formats and basically
does the hard work (while I take all
the fame... ;), it simply hasn't been
possible to release it before now.

That aside, the amount of votes have
been falling drastically in the latest
issues, and it would be great if all
of you proved us wrong and sent us a
lot of votes for the next issue which
will be out in 1999 - that's the only
thing we can promise, because there is
no reason to release a chart with too
few votes - the result would not be
comprehensive enough.

We are also going to need a new design
for the next issue, and a new title
picture. So please, send us your
prepositions for it!

Also, an »CL1:intro» would be lovely.

For other reasons, read the »CL1:"We're not
out yet, but?!"»-article.

»CL7:(And might I add - the delay is only
 a 4-week-one! »CL8:-CTN)
