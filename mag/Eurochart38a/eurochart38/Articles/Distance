»CL9:----------------------> »CL8:how to get there

»CL7:              Distance is this time held at Eikeli vgs,
              which is located at Bispeveien 10 in
              Bærum, just outside Oslo. It's very easy
              to get to the hall, several trains and
              buses stop almost outside the door. The
              easiest way to get to the hall is to take
              subway line 2 towards Østerås and get off
              at Østerås station. The way to the party
              place is marked from there.





























»CL0:              By car

              From south (coming in to Oslo from E-18 Drammen)

»CL7:                   Follow E-18 until you see a sign
                   that says "lysaker / fornebu". Drive
                   off the road (use the intersection,
                   for gods sake), then follow the
                   signs to "Jar" Follow the road a few
                   kilometers, you're supposed to cross
                   two bridges. When you've crossed the
                   last bridge, take left then right
                   again. Now just follow the road for
                   a few kilometers, you're supposed to
                   pass a Shell-station on your left
                   hand. When you've passed that one,
                   you're getting close. Now look for

                   right hand, a large brown building.
                   Take right and follow the road

                   the road a few kilometers, you're
                   supposed to cross two bridges. When
                   you've crossed the last bridge, take
                   left then right again. Now just
                   follow the road for a few
                   kilometers, you're supposed to pass
                   a Shell-station on your left hand.
