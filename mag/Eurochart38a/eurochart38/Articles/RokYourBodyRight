»CL9:Rokdazone.»CL7: The name of a legend.
Associated with excellence and
objectivity. He is no stranger to us.
Rather, this man is what one really
could call a veteran in the Scene,
beginning as early as 1988. Through
the years, he has been a great
influence in the Scene and being a
writer, his oppinions has always been
ones to consider.

Through my early years in the Scene,
Rokdazone was always someone people
respected and I pondered many times
who this guy really was. His name
flashed by in articles here and
magazines there, always clearly
raising his voice. Even though I did
not know him, his name always seemed
to be mentioned with respect.

It was thus a priviledge for me to be
able to work under Rokdazone for a few
issues of Generation, until he decided
to put things on ice for a while.
During this short time, I learned a
lot as a writer and it was a time I
really appreciated. It was also
something of a surprise when I was
told that he no longer had time for
the Scene and Generation. However, he
was gracious enough to grant me an
interview with him, which, if you read
it, will tell you more about him and
his decision to take a break from the
Scene.


»CL1:ALV:»CL0: Let us begin with the normal
     introduction. Who are you,
     really?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: Uh? Physiologically a heap of
     water, carbon and some minour
     molecules. Socially I am Henning
     Brau, 26 years, student of
     mediapsychology in Berlin /
     Germany. Pathologically I am just
     a little bit deranged.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: Deranged or not, you are
     certainly one of the most
     well-known writers in the Scene
     and one could for a moment think
     you have been writing since
     birth. Is this realy the case
     though? How did your Scenecareer
     really begin (and with what did
     it begin) and what was so
     attracting about the Scene. Or,
     in other words, why did you
     decide to join the Scene?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: My first contact to the "scene"
     was on C64 when I saw that
     somebody I knew managed to have a
     scroller, some music, a logo and
     a rasterbar on the screen. I was
     envious and wanted the same. Then
     I used to watch demos together
     with a friend and we worked on
     smaller projects on C64 who all
     failed. Then I got my Amiga and
     started to collect demos. Started
     swapping, started tracking,
     started painting and finally
     started writing in 1991 with an
     interview with Pink Panther of 
     Supplex.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: You have obviously been around
     for quite a while then. Can you
     tell us more about your career in
     the Scene, like what groups and
     projects have you beein involved
     in and what have you been doing
     in the Scene except writing?
     iting?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: The list is quite long and I am
     not sure if I get them all into
     my mind. I started with Kraze in
     late 1980s, then followed Amaze
     in 1990, Gloom in 1991, Oxyron
     for a very short time in 1991,
     Stolen Data-Team 1992, Desert in
     1992, T.M.G. in 1993, Speedy in
     1993, Destiny in 1993, Associate
     of Arts in 1994, Infect in 1994,
     Artwork in 1995 and finally
     Endzeit in 1998. Most of the
     time, I have been doublemember.
     In 1989 to 1992 I have been
     better known as musician before
     meeting Macno at The Party'92 who
     convinced me to become a writer.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: As you have been around for so
     long, you have obviously seen
     quite a lot of change during your
     years in the Scene. What do you
     think of the current situation of
     the Amiga Scene?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: Devastating. Nothing new since
     The Party'97 and releases get
     rarer and not better. Dunno, but
     this looks like the party is over
     somehow.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: You are a writer, and a good one
     as well. What do you think is the
     most important aspect of writing
     articles for a diskmag?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: Attempting to be a "real"
     journalist. Which means that one
     tries to think of interesting
     topics, investigates and to write
     them down in a neutral style with
     selected words and hopefully
     correct language. Well, that says
     a lot about what I think about
     the most aticlewriters in the
     scene, doesn't it?

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: Every writer has a certain style
     and way of composing their
     articles. When you write
     articles, how do you usually
     write? Do you plan your articles
     and do research about the topic?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: Usually, I just wait for a topic.
     Sometimes, Damion comes up with
     info or I look on IRC to find
     out, what people actually
     discuss. I also tend to simply
     contact to me unknown people and
     look what they have to tell me.
     Then I have the idea and try to
     find my own position about it and
     express it. Although it might be
     unfassionable to admit it: Yes, I
     always tried to manipulate people
     by letting my articles sound
     objective by forcing my opinion
     through the lines. I guess that
     was why Macno found my works so
     entertaining and why Fishwave
     found them so critical. Usually I
     try to find some quotations
     aswell to light up the whole.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: Generation seems to be seen as
     "proper" diskmag, where articles
     were written in >proper English
     with a pretty high level and not
     with a lot of slang. Currently
     the level of writing of diskmags
     is being dicussed in various
     diskmags. Some think it should be
     lower while others obviously do
     not? What is your oppinion on
     this controversy?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: I don't see a problem there.
     Usually think that proper English
     is highly essential for reaching
     as many readers as possible, but
     if someone has something relevant
     to express and if he can't come
     up with the right words, then
     there is no need to ban him. I
     always used the formular "Touched
     by RokDaZone" to show that I
     helped somebody with his words
     without changing the content (as
     far as it was possible). Mostly,
     people enjoyed my help.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: There are people around that are
     quite nostalgic, always talking
     about the good old days. You've
     been around quite a while after
     all, so what do you think of the
     good old days? Were they better?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: Depends of what times we talk
     here. I had MY best times in 1992
     to 1994 and a revival in 1996 to
     1997, but nowadays I don't see
     much for me to do anymore. All
     the people I started with (except
     for Damion) are gone and so are
     my best friends in the scene. It
     is not that I look down on other
     sceners who have joined later
     then I did in 1988. I only miss
     the old guys and I don't share
     the same heros with the others.
     For instance: At The Party'96,
     they played Crusaders "Space
     Deliria" on the big screen.
     Damion and me were celebrating
     this event as that demo was one
     of the best of all times - when
     compared to standards of that
     times. Skyphos/Artwork was with
     us and he joined the scene in
     1994 or so. He had no ideas about
     Crusaders and all he saw were
     some pathetic linevectors and bad
     gfx. What I try to say is with
     all these words: There were no
     good old times of the scene. But
     for every scener, there once has
     been one and when he reaches the
     point where he can devide the
     good old times from what he has
     now, then it might be time for
     him to leave.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: As a writer, you have obviously
     spent a lot of time reading and
     writing articles. Compared to,
     say 3-5 years ago, what do you
     think about the magscene these
     days and what do you think of the
     active writers around and the
     overall quality of the articles
     written?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: In 1993 and 1994, we had the best
     magscene with a lot of big and
     talented names. The editors under
     the pangalactic Macno formed its
     own art and had a right to define
     itself as standalone. We battled
     ourselves in contests for the
     best plot, language and poetry.
     Nowadays that's just past. Few
     could ever express a decent plot,
     most of them don't know what
     neutrality even means. The poets
     and wozards have left the scene.
     Nowadays swappers who don't have
     anything to swap left become
     editors and that's exactly how
     they write.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: Which are your favorite mags,
     present and past? Why? 

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: Alltime favourite: Abnormalia for
     the highest quality in language
     and ideas ever. Even the worst
     issue was way better than any
     other mag. I enjoyed Stolen Data
     as it started my writing carreer
     and of course Generation as it is
     "my" baby. Issue 25 of Generation
     can certainly be remembered as
     one of the best mags of all
     times. Call me arrogant.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: The word is out that you, a
     legend, is leaving the Scene.
     What is the reason for this? Is
     this thus the end of all your
     activities or could you see
     yourself return in a few years?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: I guess I explained it already
     before. I had my times and
     everything I needed and wanted. I
     have reached the number one on
     all charts and so had Generation.
     But after Gen25b the quality
     dropped as my motivation started
     its free fall and so I don't
     wonder at all that Fishy with CN.
     is on top nowadays. My live has
     turned into different directions
     and I have found a new "scene"
     for me. I don't see a return now,
     but we have agreed that
     Generation is not dead but put on
     ice for at least a year. Maybe
     we'll return, maybe we won't.
     Can't say now.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: Will you follow the developments
     of the Scene at all, like demos,
     parties, mags etc?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: I have been to the Symposium'99
     and although it was funny, I
     found out that I lost contact to
     the scene and I felt no
     empowerment to return. Then I
     read some mags and found that the
     topics were of such an
     outstanding banality that I felt
     no urge to answer at all. Demos?
     Dunno. After what I have seen at
     the Symp, I can't say that there
     really is a need to download
     them.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: Have you ever thought of joining
     the PC Scene? Why or why not?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: I have considered it, but I have
     no interest in that scene as my
     roots are on the Amiga (+C64).
     What would I change if I turn
     toward that scene for myself? I
     even know less people there than
     in the Amiga scene. No reason for
     a change, although I work on PC
     all the time.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: What is the thing you have
     appreciated the most in the
     Scene? Is there such a thing?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: The friendship that I found with
     Macno, Parsec, DeeJay Jones,
     Damion, Hydra, Shayera and the
     others. And of course the
     empowerment (egostimulation) that
     I received. I think it was a
     great think to see that one is
     able to compete and reach goals.
     To cooperate and train
     organising. The chance to try and
     fail without real sanctions.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: Also, what is it that you will
     remember from your time in the
     Scene?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: Never will I forget those moments
     when I first was greeted in
     Scoopex- and Andromeda-demos or
     when my music was played at The
     Party'92 or when The Gate won the
     Symp'96.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: Those that has kept their eyes
     open must have noticed that you
     have started your own company.
     Can you tell us more about this
     company?

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: In a few words: We offer
     inetservices in the sense of
     communicationsystems,
     webmarketing and the obligatory
     webdesign. Then again we promote
     and distribute music via the inet
     (.mp3) by offering tracks to
     recordlabels and make them sign
     "our" artists.

»CL1:ALV:»CL0: I'm sure most Sceners would want
     to wish you good luck with your
     future and your company? Do you
     have any last words that you
     would like to say, greets or
     something, just go ahead.

»CL3:RDZ:»CL2: Ah, regards to all the guys I
     know and knew in the scene. Don't
     be angry if i don't answer your
     mails anymore, I am plainly outta
     here. See ya...

»CL7:With that, we thank Rokdazone for his
time and wish him a lot of luck with
his company and his future.
