{9{4 How To Convert Text To The Right

{9{4           Format


{1Load Protext. Load the file

{6ruler.protext

{1from the {6Article_Test dir {1found on
most Grapevine disks e.g. Grapevine 11
disk 1

A ruler should now appear at the top
of the screen & you should see the
command

{6pl 22
zm

{1Now load the article you want to
convert by selecting {6merge file

{1from the file menu. Make sure the
cursor is below the ruler.

Select {6document mode {1from the
{6option menu

{1Now move the cursor below the ruler
to where the text begins. Go into
command mode by pressing {6ESC
{1Now type :

{6format

{1your file should now be converted to
the correct format, with a right hand
margin of 39 characters.

You will need to tidy up your doc by
inserting/deleting a few spaces.

Once you have tidied up your doc &
included any character codes it's time
to save your doc. The doc has to be
saved in ASCII format. To do this
go to the command mode (press ESC) &
type

{6sa filename

{1You will now see a requester asking if
you want to print, skip or ESC the doc.
{6Print {1the doc by pressing space.
Your document won't be printed but
saved as ASCII. You will need to
{6Print {1each page. This is how
Protext saves a file in ASCII format.
To be on the safe side make sure you
make a back-up of your doc by saving
it in the normal way.

If you want to test your doc to see
how it will look in Grapevine then
you will need to load the article
tester command {6Grapevinetest
{1from the {6article_test dir {1on
Grapevine 11 disk 1. The easiest way
to do this is from CLI.

Type

{6Article_Test/Grapevinetest filename

{1I found it easier to copy the
{6Grapevinetest {1command to my articles
disk & then run it from there.

If you are still confused then load
this doc {6 codes1 {1into {6Protext
{1that should clear up any or all

{2{7{9{A C o n f u s i o n ! ! ! ! ! !

{1A printout would also be

{6{7{9{A V e r y  H e l p f u l ! ! !

Cyanide.
