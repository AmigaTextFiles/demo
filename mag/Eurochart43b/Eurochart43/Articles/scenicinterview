»CL0:»BIG:                                                    Scenic Group Interview
»CL1:»SML:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
»CL5:                               by Darkhawk/IRIS
»CL1:
»CL2:Scenic  »CL1:is  a  somewhat  newly founded
groups  only  around »CL0:2 months»CL1: old.  In
the start, it was meant to be an Amiga
»CL0:only »CL1:  group,   but   later  that  was
changed, and now the group is »CL0:platform
independent»CL1:.  We decided to meet up on
their »CL0: #scenic»CL1:  channel  on  IRC for a
group interview (no, I won't »CL0:pretend»CL1: I
travelled  to  e.g.   Norway,  invited
them   to   a  drink  at  a  pub,  and
interviewed  them,  like so many other
writers  like  to  »CL0:pretend»CL1:  when  they
interview,  heh).  Infact, all current
members  of  »CL2:Scenic»CL1: appeared, with the
exception  of  »CL2:Caro»CL1:,  so  present were





»CL2:Critikill»CL1:, »CL2:Fusko»CL1:,»CL2: Java»CL1:,»CL2: Orome»CL1:,»CL2: Pix»CL1: and
»CL2:Splif»CL1:.  Although»CL6: Devotion»CL1: and»CL6: Sabotage»CL1:
beat  us  to  the punch in getting the
first     information    about    this
interesting  new  group out, the »CL6:EC»CL1: is
still the one to give you the in-depth
»CL0:details»CL1:  from  the  whole  group (yes,
this  was  advertizing).  So, we start
after  I  had just joined the channel,
and  we  were still waiting for people
to show up:

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::   We are still missing a couple
of  members.  »CL2: Pix»CL1:  should be here any
minute now.

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   Well  no  problem,  I will
wait a bit.

»CL2:Java»CL1::   My  fucking  »CL0:internet provider»CL1:
didn't  let  me in, so I had to run to
work!  *sweating*

»CL2:Pix»CL1::  So.  Everyone is here then?

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   Yes,  as  for  rules here,
just  talk  when  you  want to, I will
edit it, but be a bit »CL0:merciful»CL1:.

»CL2:Orome»CL1::    Heh....    Let's   make  the
editor's job a »CL0:pain»CL1:.

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::    Goodie..    Let's   start
then..  You are a new group, but not a
»CL3:'usual'»CL1:  new  group.   No, instead you
are  a  new  group  consisting only of
»CL0:graphicians»CL1:.  How did you get the idea
for  this, and why?  And, who were the
»CL0:founders»CL1: of »CL2:Scenic»CL1:?

»CL2:Pix»CL1::  »CL2:Fusko»CL1:, shall we...?

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::    Yep..    The   founders  are
probably »CL2:Pix»CL1: and myself..

»CL2:Pix»CL1::   Yes.   We  both  wanted to join
something  »CL0:new»CL1:..   After »CL2: Mangoo»CL1:  went
»CL0:inactive»CL1:.    First  we  thought  about
joining  »CL2:Encore»CL1:, but sadly they didn't
allow any more people to join.

»CL2:Java»CL1::   (You didn't really say WHY you
started it) ;)

»CL2:Pix»CL1::   Erm,  yes.   We  thought  about
doing a co-op with »CL2:Encore»CL1: instead, and
then  »CL2:fusko»CL1:  got  the  bright  idea of
starting  a  »CL0:gfx»CL1:  group..   Just doing
co-ops whenever we »CL0:feel»CL1: like it.  Most
of the planning was done at a café and
on  the  phone.   Anything more to add
»CL2:Fusko»CL1:?
 
»CL2:Fusko»CL1::  We wanted to add something»CL0: new»CL1:
to the scene..  So we started »CL2:Scenic»CL1:.

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   So,  it started with »CL2:Fusko»CL1:
and yourself..  But others have joined
since  then,  infact  quite  a  lot of
»CL0:graphicians»CL1: seemingly thought the idea
of  a  gfx only group was a good idea.
Who  are  your »CL0:members »CL1:now?  And those
present might aswell tell us all their
thoughts about the group.

»CL2:Pix»CL1::   Well,  I  think  »CL2:Orome»CL1:  was the
first   one   to   join.    Hm.   Then
»CL2:Critikill»CL1: joined, and after that »CL2:Caro»CL1:,
»CL2:Java»CL1:   and   »CL2:Splif»CL1:.   In  that  order.
»CL2:Fusko»CL1:, am I right?

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::   Yes,  and  »CL2:Mustafa^rj»CL1: visited
our  group  for  some days (but that's
another story).

»CL2:Pix»CL1::   Indeed.  Hm.  Perhaps we should
add  some more about the members...  I
guess they could introduce themselves?

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   Sure, some words from each
of  you,  »CL0:who »CL1:you are,»CL0: why»CL1: you joined,
»CL0:what»CL1: you do.

»CL2:Java»CL1::  Hehe..  I joined »CL2:Scenic»CL1: because
it  seemed  like  a  lot  of  cool and
talanted  artists  who  were  going to
create  a  lot  of fun and good »CL0:stuff»CL1:.
Personally I've been jumping between a
lot of idling groups both on the Amiga
and  PC  since 92' or something.  I am
mostly  a  2d kinda guy but also do 3d
stuff.   Daytime  I  work  as  a  »CL0:Lead
Artist»CL1: at a swedish »CL0:game company»CL1:.

»CL2:Pix»CL1::  Next?

»CL2:Java»CL1::  I can introduce myself again!

»CL2:Pix»CL1::  Erm...

»CL2:Orome»CL1::  Uhm..  Let's see

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   Don't be shy, you may talk
as much as you want!

»CL2:Orome»CL1::   I  dunno'...  Why did I »CL0:join»CL1:.
Probably  because  it's  a good way to
get  my  ass  in  gear and »CL0:finish»CL1: some
drawings  for a change (haven't done a
proper  one for »CL0:2-3 years»CL1:).  Something
like  that  I think + me and »CL2:Pix»CL1:/»CL2:Fusko»CL1:
»CL0:know»CL1: eachother already.

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::  I'm »CL2:Fusko»CL1: -aka- »CL0:Torgeir Vee»CL1:, I
joined the scene about a year ago - so
i'm   one   of   the  »CL0:newcomers»CL1:.   I'm
probably the only »CL2:scenic»CL1:-member who is
not going to work with gfx the rest of
my   life.   And  I  don't  have  much
gfx-experince.   I'm  still a »CL0:student»CL1:,
and  in  a couple of years I will be a
»CL0:dentist»CL1:..  Errr..  If I pass my exams,
that is.

»CL2:Pix»CL1::    Hm.    Well,  I'm  »CL2:Pix»CL1:  (Espen
Terjesen),  I joined the scene back in
»CL0:94/95»CL1:.   My first group was »CL2:IRIS»CL1:, then
»CL2:Subspace»CL1:,  »CL2:Rebels»CL1:, »CL2:Endzeit»CL1: and others,
who  died  before  we  made something,
like »CL2: Digital  Corruption »CL1: and »CL2:LSD»CL1:.  I
have  been  drawing  since »CL0:1990»CL1: when I
got my first Amiga (»CL0:A500»CL1:).

»CL2:Critikill»CL1::  At the moment I'm studying
»CL0:graphics-design»CL1:...  First contact with
pixeling  was back in 1990 with my 1st
amiga!   In 94' I bought my 1st PC and
started  to  join some groups...  Some
years ago I discovered »CL0:PHOTOSHOP 4.0»CL1: -
and  since  those days I'm addicted to
do graphics.  At the moment I'm only a
»CL0:2d»CL1: graphician, but I think this should
be enough as I don't want to enter the
»CL0:gamedevelopment»CL1: sector!

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   Ok..   What  are the »CL0:plans»CL1:
and  »CL0:aims»CL1:  of »CL2:Scenic»CL1:, more concretely,
than  just  doing co-ops when you feel
like  it?   Any »CL0:strategy»CL1: with which to
take  the  scene  by  storm?  Longtime
plans..  Or just »CL0:projects»CL1:?

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::    »CL2:Scenic»CL1:   has  some  »CL0:projects»CL1:
coming  up.   We will start working on
our    first   »CL0:slideshow»CL1:   soon,   the
PC-version    will   be   out   first.
followed   up  by  the  Amiga-version.
Still  not  sure  what group that will
»CL0:code »CL1: the  Amiga-slide.   We have also
talked    with   one   of   the   best
Amiga-coders,  and he said yes to code
our   first   Amiga-demo.    We   will
probably  make  an Amiga-version and a
PC-version           of          every
»CL2:Scenic»CL1:-production..   (it will contain
the same pictures/gfx)

»CL2:Critikill»CL1::     Our   own   productions
(coops)  will be on »CL0:both»CL1: systems - the
other  stuff we'll make is gfx-support
for  the whole DEMO-scene...  If there
are  attractive  requests...  We'll do
them   for   other  sceners  ...   PC,
Amiga..

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   Will  that  »CL0:slide»CL1:  feature
pictures from all of your members?  Is
there  some »CL0:releasedate»CL1: for that demo,
or  is nothing that »CL0:concrete »CL1:yet?  And
who  is coding your PC production side
of it?  You have enough willing coders
for  that  too?  I must say, it sounds
like quite a »CL0:new»CL1: way of doing things!

»CL2:Pix»CL1::   Hehe.   The  slide will feature
»CL0:three»CL1: pics from all »CL0:7»CL1: graphicians.  We
are  not  certain about who's going to
»CL0:code»CL1:  it  on  the  PC  yet..   We have
several  offers.   Have  to  check out
who's the best one.

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::    Three   pictures  from  each
»CL2:Scenic»CL1:-member..   (each  member  chose
their  favorite  pictures).   We  hope
that  »CL2:Mawi»CL1:  will  help us out with the
»CL0:Amiga»CL1:-slide..   But if so, it will not
be  out  for  some months (many of the
»CL2:Mawi»CL1:-members   are  working  on  other
prods).  When it comes to the demo, we
will  start on this soon..  No release
date yet.  But it will contain lots of
gfx..   he  he.   Since  most  of  our
graphicians  are making »CL0:24-bit»CL1: images,
many  of  the  Amiga-prods  will be on
»CL0:high-end»CL1: Amigas.

»CL2:Java»CL1::    Personally   I   think  demos
nowadays  »CL0:lack»CL1: nice graphics..  Mostly
boring  »CL0:truecolor  textures»CL1:  and stuff
like  that.   As  far  as  I know, our
prods  are  going  to  be more »CL0:graphic»CL1:
oriented.

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   Ok,  that  does sound very
»CL0:interesting»CL1:..   When  can we expect to
see  the first official »CL2:Scenic»CL1: release
or coop, do you think?

»CL2:Pix»CL1::   You  will see our contributions
everywhere,  »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:,  even  in  »CL0:your»CL1:
mag!

»CL2:Critikill»CL1::   We  already did our 1st 2
gfx supports!

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::   Well, »CL2:Scenic»CL1: has already done
some  small  releases...   To »CL2:Skid Row»CL1:
and »CL2:Massive»CL1: (gfx supplied by»CL2: Critikill»CL1:
the  »CL4:"gfx-machine"»CL1:)  and  most  of the
pictures are ready for the»CL0: slideshow»CL1:..
But  to  be  honest  we  won't set any
release-date  yet..   We  want to make
»CL0:hi-quality-prods»CL1:..    And  not  crappy
hurry  hurry-prods.   and  with  the 7
members  we are now, I think we should
have   all  aspects  of  gfx-covered..
both design, pictures, textures, logs,
and 3d..

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   So..   Being »CL0:graphicians»CL1:..
Let's  talk  a  bit  about  »CL0:graphics»CL1:..
Will there be a special, »CL2:SCN»CL1: style for
all of your productions, or will it be
»CL0:individual»CL1:?    And   what   »CL0:tools»CL1:  and
»CL0:computers »CL1: are  you  using?  Critikill
mentioned  »CL0:Photoshop»CL1:, which comes with
a  distinctive  style  too of course..
Are  you  a  mixed  bunch of pixel and
image graphicians, or..?

»CL2:Pix»CL1::   Yes.  we got an »CL0:expert»CL1: in every
field  :)  Well,  we're  going to make
each prod unique really.

»CL2:Java»CL1::   Which means that some of us is
probably going to make more stuff than
the  others..  Since for example »CL0:logos»CL1:
are   more   wanted   than   fullscale
pictures.

»CL2:Pix»CL1::   True  »CL2:Java»CL1:.  You'll have plenty
to do for our larger prods tho'.

»CL2:Java»CL1::  »CL0:*hooray*»CL1:

(Here  I  should  add  that »CL2: Pix»CL1:  uses
»CL0:Deluxepaint     5.0»CL1:,     »CL2:Fusko»CL1:    uses
»CL0:Photogenics»CL1:,    and   the   rest   use
»CL0:photoshop»CL1:  for  their work.  »CL2:Java»CL1: also
uses  »CL0:Maya»CL1:,  and »CL2: Orome»CL1:  also  uses »CL0:3D
Studio Max»CL1: for 3D)

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   But..  About style..  Will
it   be   »CL0:individual»CL1:  style  for  each
drawing/production,   or   a  sort  of
overall  »CL3:'SCN  feel'»CL1:  style, like e.g.
»CL2:Melon»CL1: had it?

»CL2:Pix»CL1::   We  will see to that every prod
has  a  style.   no mixture of several
styles.  But I guess we won't have »CL0:ONE»CL1:
»CL2:SCN»CL1: style going on in every prod.

»CL2:Java»CL1::   I don't think you will be able
to   spot  a  certain  »CL3:"Scenic"»CL1:  style
except  for  the  fact that it will be
dead »CL0:gorgoeus»CL1: to look at ;)

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::    Hopefully   both   »CL0:textures»CL1:,
»CL0:design»CL1:, »CL0: gfx»CL1: and »CL0:3d»CL1: will all work well
together.

»CL2:Pix»CL1::    You   won't   get  the  normal
'effect'  -  'black screen' - 'effect'
demos from us.

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   Hehe,  you  will  be  held
accountable  for  what  you say here..
Ok,  this  all sounds very promising I
must say..  In the end, I will let you
send  out  greetings,  messges  to the
scene,  that  sort of boring, »CL0:standard»CL1:
thing..

»CL2:Pix»CL1::  Who's first?

»CL2:Java»CL1::    Ohh..    Greetings..    *joy*
Unfortunately   there   are  too  many
people I would like to greet.  So..  I
would  say  »CL0:cheers»CL1:  to  my  »CL0:friends»CL1: on
»CL0:#pixel»CL1:  and  the  people who have been
supportive throughout the years, and a
special greet to my old pal »CL2:Danny/TBL»CL1:!
Woa!  :)

»CL2:Pix»CL1::   I  would  like  to greet all in
»CL2:Scenic»CL1:  (ofcourse), all in»CL2: Darkage»CL1: and
in  »CL2:Nah-Kolor»CL1:.   Hm,  what  the  heck,
greetings to the»CL0: whole scene»CL1:!!!  :D

»CL2:Critikill»CL1::  I want to greet »CL2:FARBRAUSCH»CL1:
and »CL2:HAUJOBB»CL1: !!!

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::  I want to greet all the »CL0:polish»CL1:
Amiga-sceners,  »CL2:Encore»CL1:, »CL2:Mawi»CL1:,»CL2: Appendix»CL1:
and »CL2:Potion»CL1:.

»CL2:Pix»CL1::    »CL2:Fusko»CL1:   is  commonly  know  as
»CL2:fuskoPOL»CL2: among polish sceners :)

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::   »CL0:Polski rulez »CL1::D And of course
an  extra greeting to all Amiga-groups
who support »CL0:ppc»CL1:.

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   Hrmm  ok,  thanks  for the
interview  guys,  and  thanks  for the
»CL0:panel»CL1: Java!

»CL2:Java»CL1::   No  problem  Darkhawk, it's my
pleasure!

»CL2:Pix»CL1::    When  will  the  »CL6:Eurochart»CL1:  be
released  in »CL0: 1280x768x24bit»CL1:  with »CL0:PPC
support»CL1:?!?!?

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::   Uhmm,  when  »CL0:Hell  freezes
over»CL1:?

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::   Btw..   Splif didn't say much
today..   so  I  should add that he is
our new »CL0:logo-master»CL1:.

»CL2:Splif»CL1::  Hum I'm just a long-time »CL0:guest»CL1:
=)

»CL2:Pix»CL1::   You  can  add  in  the  »CL6:EC»CL1: that
people  can check out mine and »CL2:Fusko's»CL1:
gfx at »CL0:espent.cjb.net»CL1:

»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1::  You will have to pay me for
advertizing..

»CL2:Fusko»CL1::   Check  out  the »CL2:Critikill»CL1: and
»CL2:Orome»CL1: galleries at:

»CL0:www.gfxzone.org..»CL1:

And »CL2:Splifs»CL1: work at:

»CL0:splif.aegis-corp.org.»CL1:

»CL2:Scenic»CL1: doesn't have a homepage yet.  I
don't know where you can find pictures
by  »CL2:caro»CL1:  and and »CL2:java»CL1:, but interested
could         mail        us        at
