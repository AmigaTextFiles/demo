»CL1:This  article  was  originally written
for»CL6: Devotion 2»CL1: back in early »CL0:February»CL1:.
But  due  to  the  »CL0:incompetence»CL1:  of  a
certain  »CL0:editor»CL1:,  I  choose to publish
the  article  slightly modified in the
»CL6:EuroChart 43»CL1:m instead.

Many  times  I've  had  »CL0:problems»CL1:  with
deciding  what  to »CL0:vote»CL1: for.  It's not
because there are overwhelming »CL0:numbers»CL1:
of  »CL0:productions»CL1: or »CL0:groups»CL1: to vote for,
but  rather  the  »CL0:opposite»CL1:.   Over the
last  couple of years a lot of sceners
have  »CL0:left»CL1:  the  scene,  and therefore
there   are   not   that   many   good





»CL0:productions»CL1:   being  created  anymore.
Infact, I think that in certain areas,
the  »CL0:quality»CL1:  of  the  productions has
»CL0:decreased»CL1: since 1996/97.

In  the »CL0:mag»CL1: department for instance, I
don't  think  any  of the present mags
(like  »CL6:D.I.S.C»CL1:,  »CL6:Devotion»CL1:,  »CL6:EuroChart»CL1:,
»CL6:ShowTime»CL1:  etc.)  can  compete with the
best diskmags of »CL0:1995»CL1: for example.  In
my  opinion  there  still  hasn't been
released  one  single diskmag the last
5-6  years  which can compete with the
»CL0:originality »CL1: and  »CL0:ideas»CL1:, often refered
to  as  »CL0:revolitionary»CL1: article work, of
»CL6:R.A.W.»CL1:   And no mag at all can compete
with  the  splendid »CL0:language»CL1: presented
in  »CL6:R.O.M.»CL1:   The  same  goes  for  the
»CL0:research»CL1: articles of »CL6:Upstream»CL1:.

As   for  »CL0:slideshows»CL1:,  not  many  good
slideshows have been released the last
few  years.   »CL0:Years  »CL1:go by between the
good    releases.     To   be   really
»CL0:subjective»CL1:,  I think »CL6:"Divine"»CL1: that was
released  last  year, is the only good
»CL0:pixel-art»CL1:   slideshow  that  has  been
released     for    years.     Perhaps
»CL6:"Photocell  1x1" »CL1: released in 1999 was
good,  but  it's  not  »CL0:pixel»CL1: art.  And
then we have to go to 1998, and »CL6:"5977"»CL1:
to  see  a  good  slideshow.   And  of
course  »CL6:"Wild" »CL1: back in 1996.  But the
real »CL0:pixel-art»CL1: slideshows more or less
»CL0:vanished»CL1:  back  in  1994,  like »CL6:"Seven
Seas"»CL1: and »CL6:"Never Liked Uno"»CL1:.  And then
we  have  the »CL0:demos»CL1:!  What happened to
being  »CL0:innovative»CL1:?   What  happened to
the  »CL0:2d»CL1:  effects?   Over  the last few
years I got the feeling everything has
to be »CL0:3D»CL1:!  The other routines are just
old  effects  that  are »CL0:recycled»CL1:.  And
then  we  have these productions which
only  include  »CL3:"design"»CL1:  and  no  real
»CL0:code»CL1:.    So   the   last   good   real
Amiga-demos were made back in 1996/97,
I  guess.   Demos  such as »CL6:Muscles»CL1: and
»CL6:Tint»CL1:  got  lots of cool »CL0:effects»CL1:.  They
were  »CL0:original»CL1:  and  not  like  todays
copies of »CL0:PC demos»CL1:.

So  to  my dilemma:  What to »CL0:vote»CL1: for?
Should  I  vote  for  all  kind of »CL0:old»CL1:
productions  which  I think are »CL0:better»CL1:
than  todays  productions, or should I
vote   for   the  best  of  the  »CL0:newer»CL1:
productions?

If  we  all  should  vote  for the »CL0:old»CL1:
productions,  »CL0:new»CL1: productions wouldn't
enter  the  »CL0:charts»CL1:.  At least it would
be  extremely  hard  to  get  the »CL0:nr.1»CL1:
position   in   a  diskmag  chart  for
example.   And  because  of »CL6:"Wild"»CL1:, no
new slideshow has managed to enter the
nr.1  position  for  »CL0:5  years»CL1:!  Having
only old productions at the top of the
charts,    could    take   away   some
»CL0:motivation»CL1:  from  certain sceners.  To
enter a chart can be quite »CL0:fascinating»CL1:
and  make  one  work  even  »CL0:harder»CL1:  to
produce  something  good.   This could
also  work the other way:  if it's too
»CL0:easy»CL1:  to  enter, some sceners wouldn't
bother   to   create  something  good,
because  they  already »CL0:know»CL1: they'll be
high on the charts.

For  me,  I  have  decided to vote for
some  »CL0:old»CL1:  productions  and  some  »CL0:new»CL1:
ones.   I simply make a combination of
old  and new productions I enjoy, like
in  the  categories demos, slideshows,
diskmags, musicdisks etc.

In  some  categories  I  don't have to
vote  for  any old productions at all,
though.   This  is  because  there has
been  a  huge increase in quality when
it  comes  to »CL0:4k»CL1: and »CL0:40/60k»CL1: intros for
example.    Intros   such   as  »CL6:Humus»CL1:,
»CL6:Revision»CL1:,    »CL6:Gap»CL1:,    »CL6:Bier»CL1:,    »CL6:Mitosis»CL1:,
»CL6:Incision»CL1:, »CL6: Push»CL1:,»CL6:  Gift»CL1:,  »CL6:Grid 2»CL1:, »CL6:Gush»CL1:,
»CL6:Option»CL1:, »CL6:Zeon»CL1: etc.  are very good.

Perhaps  there  should  be  a»CL0: rule»CL1: for
which  productions  we can vote for at
the  various charts (like how »CL0:old»CL1: they
can  be),  but  then again...  perhaps
»CL0:not»CL1:.

In  any case, the most »CL0:important»CL1: thing
is  to  remember to »CL0:VOTE!!!»CL1:  So please
fill  a  few »CL0:votesheets»CL1: to the various
mags out there...
