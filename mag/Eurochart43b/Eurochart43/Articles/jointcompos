»CL1:
These  last  years, »CL0:joint competitions»CL1:
have  become  a »CL0: reality»CL1:, in more than
one way.

More  and  more parties have announced
joint  competitions, like in the »CL0:intro»CL1:
competitions.   At parties such as the
»CL6:Assembly»CL1:   and   »CL6:the   Gathering »CL1:  for
instance both PC and Amiga productions
are accepted in the »CL0:same»CL1: competitions.

Many  sceners  have found this »CL0:unfair»CL1:,
as  there  is a big difference between
the  latest  »CL0:PC»CL1:  hardware  and the old
»CL0:Amiga»CL1:    hardware.     Therefore   the





PC-sceners   got   an  advantage  with
better  »CL0:processor  power»CL1:  and  usually
more »CL0: RAM»CL1:  as  well.   In  addition to
that,  they  can  use  more »CL0:colours»CL1: in
their  productions  and have of course
modules which use more»CL0: channels»CL1:.

Whatever  you  might  think about this
topic, there's not that much we can do
about  it as the mentioned parties are
»CL0:dominated»CL1:   by   PC   people  and  the
organizers  will  probably  not listen
much  to  what  »CL0:Amiga»CL1:  sceners have to
say.  So the only thing you can really
do,  is  to  visit  a  party with more
Amiga sceners.

If  you  decide  to  visit  some  real
»CL0:scene-parties»CL1:,         like        the
»CL6:Mekka-Symposium»CL1:  party,  another  more
interesting  discussion appears.  What
about   the  joint  competitions  with
»CL0:classic»CL1:  Amiga productions and the »CL0:PPC»CL1:
productions?

Until now the PPC demos haven't really
»CL0:dominated»CL1:  any competition that I know
of, but it's a fact that it gives alot
of»CL0:  advantages»CL1:  to use PPC and certain
graphics  cards  instead  of a classic
»CL0:060»CL1:  Amiga  for  instance.  Again also
the  processor  power  will be a great
advantage,  as  »CL0:speed»CL1:  is essential in
some  ways.  But then again, to make a
good  demo  you  also need a good idea
and  overrall design after my opinion.
So  the  »CL0:PPC»CL1:  won't  make the demo for
you, hehe...

When  we  look  at the intros however,
some   of  the  best  intros  are  PPC
intros.    At»CL6:  Mekka-Symposium»CL1:  Potion
with  their »CL6:Option»CL1: intro easily won in
the  best  intro competition ever (few
but very good entries).  All the other
entries  were classic Amiga intros, so
they  had  a  »CL0:disadvantage»CL1:.   So is it
»CL0:fair»CL1:  to  have  both  PPC  and classic
productions in the same compo?  Should
we»CL0:  do»CL1:  something  about  that  in the
future?

These  questions  are  hard to answer.
If there had been ALOT of both classic
and  PPC  productions  in  the various
competitions this wouldn't have been a
problem  as  we  then  could »CL0:split»CL1: the
compos.   But  at  the moment that's a
bit  hard  as  there  are  so  few »CL0:PPC»CL1:
entries.  At the »CL6:Mekka-Symposium »CL1:party            »PIC:dafreak-ec1.iff»
there would be one compo with only ONE
entry  for  instance, so that would be
»CL0:hopeless»CL1:.

Whatever  you  might  think about this
matter, there's no »CL0:easy»CL1: solution.  But
I  guess  joint competitions have come
to stay whether you like it or not...
