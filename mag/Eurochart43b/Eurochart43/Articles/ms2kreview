»CL5:                                by Darkhawk/IRIS

»CL6:Devotion»CL1:  did  the graphic review from
the  »CL6:MS»CL1: party, but we will bring you a
comprehensive   review  of  »CL0:all  Amiga
productions»CL1:  released  in competitions
there.   Ok,  we  might not write much
about each and every production, but I
think  we're  excused  there,  or this
article  would  really  be »CL0:huge»CL1:, since
there  were »CL0:29»CL1: releases!  One evening,
»CL2:Dr.   Doom»CL1:, »CL2:Vanvid»CL1: and myself sat down
and  took  notes, while we watched the
productions,  and  uhh..  Got a bit to
»CL0:drink»CL1:,   but   I  will  sort  out  any
»CL0:intoxicated»CL1:  remarks  from these notes
(I  can  see that there are many, eh),





and  form  them into this »CL0:review»CL1:.  So,
no  »CL0:drunken  demowatching»CL1: article this
time,  this  is »CL0:totally »CL1:serious..  And
we  do not shirk away from telling you
our  »CL0:honest»CL1: truth, whether you like it
or not.  However, as a small »CL0:safeguard»CL1:
against  your eventual wrath, we won't
state   who   thought  what  in  these
reviews, hehe.

We  start  with the »CL0:4k»CL1: intros.  4 were
released,  and  we take them in bottom
to  top order of placement, like we do
with all the releases...  Here goes!

»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:              4k Intros
»CL1:--------------------------------------

»CL9:Scur»CL9:/»CL9:Apathy»CL1:

»CL2:Zeeball »CL1: coded  this, and it is short,
meaning  it  is  only one effect, it's
»CL0:primitive»CL1:  and  features »CL0:ugly colours»CL1:.
Looks  like  a real »CL0:fast»CL1: job, which is
»CL0:sad»CL1:.  A recurring trend here is likely
to  be  that people use way too little
time  »CL0:making»CL1:  their productions, often
only  »CL0:1-2  days»CL1:.   Come  on, isn't the
scene  worth spending »CL0:time»CL1: on anymore?
Releases  like  these  could easily be
prevented   by   spending   more  time
»CL0:bettering»CL1: them.

»CL9:Ocean/GFB»CL1:
This  intro  is  long, so long that we
just  »CL0:quit»CL1:  it  after  some  time.  It
features  »CL0:one »CL1: routine and music.  The
routine is a bit hard to describe, but
the coder, »CL2:MZ1453»CL1:, had to use a blocky
resolution  to show it, which »CL0:detracts»CL1:
a  bit  from  it.   The »CL0:music»CL1: is quite
good quality for a 4k, and is probably
the  most  advanced  thing in this 4k,
too   bad   it's  long  and  not  very
»CL0:interesting»CL1:,  although it »CL0:is»CL1: relaxing.
The  infinite  plane  routine  has bad
»CL0:depth-cueing»CL1:,   that  is,  it  has  no
interpolation.  Would have looked more
impressive with that.

»CL9:Brus/Ephidrena»CL1:

We  must  say,  it is a very cool idea
doing   a  4k  »CL0:musicdisk»CL1:.   I  thought
»CL2:Loonies»CL1:  were cool by doing it in »CL0:64k»CL1:,
but  this  is  »CL0:much»CL1: better, naturally.
The  »CL0:samples»CL1: are of a good 4k quality,
and  albeit the tunes themselves are a
bit  »CL0:one-sided»CL1:,  which  is  only to be
expected,  looking  at  the »CL0:size»CL1:, they
are  well  done.   There  are tunes, a
little   coloreffect,  and  thats  it.
This should become a »CL0:classic»CL1:, I think.
Definately  the  best 4k musicdisk out
there..   Heheh..   Sadly it was quite
»CL0:unstable»CL1: on our computer, crashing and
freezing.

»CL9:Boom/Secretly»CL1:

Here   we   have   the   »CL0:winner»CL1:,   and
deservedly  so,  since  it is a »CL0:solid»CL1:,
good 4k, with nice and varied effects,
a  cool  »CL0:logo  writer»CL1:, a good »CL0:tune»CL1: and
some   fine   consistent   »CL0:design»CL1:  and
»CL0:colour  schemes»CL1:.  Although the effects
are  not  »CL0:revolutionary»CL1:,  and  we have
seen  much  better  effects in »CL2:Extreme»CL1:
4k's,  they are nice.  Congratulations
to  »CL2:Secretly!»CL1:  Or, maybe we should say
»CL2:Scarab»CL1:, hehe.

Overall,  we  »CL0:agree»CL1:  on the placements
here, they're quite»CL0: fair»CL1:.  And now for
the  »CL0:64k»CL1:  intros,  of which there were
only 5.

»CL1:-------------------------------------
»CL0:             64k Intros
»CL1:-------------------------------------

»CL9:1 Week/Contraz»CL0:

Although  this finished »CL0:last»CL1:, it is by
no  means a »CL0:bad»CL1: intro.  Ok, some would
say  it  is  »CL0:boring»CL1:,  but it is really
»CL0:well  designed »CL1: and different from the
usual  style.   The»CL0: colourschemes»CL1: used
are very good, with greyscale here and
there.   Basically  you see one effect
per  »CL0:weekday»CL1:,  while  you get a little
story  to  each  weekday,  culminating
sunday, with the last routine.  »CL0:Unique»CL1:
idea.   The  music however is»CL0: monotone»CL1:
and »CL0:boring»CL1:, the effects themselves are
»CL0:so-so»CL1:,  nothing  awesome,  but not too
»CL0:primitive»CL1: either.  The best  aspect of
this  intro is the idea which is a bit
»CL0:original»CL1:,  and  therefore  a  bit »CL0:cool»CL1:
too.    It  seems  not  to  deallocate
»CL0:chipram»CL1:  when  exiting though, so that
we had to reboot.  Tsk, tsk...

»CL9:Polish Kitchen/Slummy&Zixaq»CL1:
»CL2:Slummy»CL1:  was really active this easter,
dominating  the  TG  competitions, and
also finding time to release a »CL0:64k»CL1: for
MS.    Again,   I  would  wish  people
focused  on one thing, and spent their
time   »CL0:finetuning »CL1:  that   production,
instead  of  releasing  a lot of so-so
releases.   Well, but this intro is of
an ok quality, the »CL0:routines»CL1: are so-so,
that  is, there's a lot of basic »CL0:3D»CL1: in
the  intro.   Seems  like  people have
moved     away     from     »CL0:texturing»CL1:,
»CL0:gouraudshading»CL1:,   etc.,   in   intros,
opting  instead  for  a  »CL0:cleaner»CL1:, more
aesthetically  pleasing 3D »CL0:experience»CL1:.
That's  ok  too,  and  »CL0:coincidentially»CL1:
much  easier  coding, but it does gets
»CL0:boring»CL1:  and is in no way impressive to
look at.  In some ways it is a bit sad
to  see »CL0:89-91'»CL1: routines in productions
today,   in   some  ways  it  »CL0:IS»CL1:  more
pleasing to the eye than »CL0:heavy»CL1: 3D.  As
for  the  music  in  this intro, it is
monotoneous,     nothing    especially
»CL0:noteworthy.»CL1:

»CL9:Melba/Appendix»CL1:

This  intro is »CL0:cute!»CL1:  And the music in
it  stands  out  a »CL0:lot»CL1: after the other
productions, which, with the exception
of   »CL6:Boom»CL1:,  did  not  make  us  listen
especially  much  to  the music.  Good
music,  which  sounds  like  it is »CL0:AHX»CL1:
made,  and has that classic sound most
just  »CL0:love»CL1:.   The  intro  itself seems
wellpolished  with different »CL0:2d»CL1: and »CL0:3d»CL1:
effects,   with   a  newspaper  design
working  as  relaxing part between the
effects,  the  »CL0:colourscheme»CL1:  is  good,
pleasing  to the eyes, and »CL0:overall»CL1: you
get  a  little smile to your face when
seeing this intro.  It »CL0:multitasks»CL1: too,
but   on   the  negative  side,  as  a
consequence  of »CL0:bad system coding»CL1:, the
3D  effects on our testmachine (A1260)
were very slow,  and we mean very,  as
in moving under »CL0:10 fps»CL1:. Thats the only
decidingly  negative  thing about this
intro  though.  Well, the »CL0:english»CL1: text
is  bad too, but noticably better than
»CL0:most»CL1:  polish  stuff,  and in any case,
that  shouldn't count too much against
it.

»CL9:Zeon/Nature»CL1:

First  off..   This is the first Amiga
intro   that  features   a  »CL0:loadertune»CL1:
while  it  is »CL0:precalculating»CL1:!  This is
an »CL0: extremely  »CL1:positive  thing, we all
thought,  very  cool  seeing  this  in
effect  for  the  first  time.  We had
thought  about doing the same in »CL2:IRIS»CL1:,
but  ok, »CL0: respect»CL1: to those who made it
as the first.  You could say that just
because  of  this, this intro deserved
to  win,  but we wouldn't go that far.
We  don't »CL0:need»CL1: to, since this intro is
»CL0:very»CL1:  well  done,  also apart from the
loadertune.   The  maintune  is  in  8
channels,  and  yes, we have seen some
of  the  effects before, in »CL6:Grid2»CL1:, but
it   seems   like  most  groups  reuse
effects,  especially  »CL0:winning»CL1: effects,
so  this  will  only count as a little
negative  thing this time.  The double
raycasted   tunnel   is   »CL0:sweet»CL1:,   the
raycasted,  transforming  »CL0:tubes»CL1:  are a
new  way  of  doing raycasting, the 3D
objects  with flares are as cute as in
»CL6:Grid2»CL1:,  the  design  is  stylish,  the
music is »CL0:ok»CL1: and it is pleasant looking
at  a  »CL0:pastel colourscheme»CL1:.  In short,
this »CL0: should»CL1:  have  been  the  winner,
»CL0:but»CL1:..

»CL9:Option/Potion»CL1:

Instead   this   »CL0:PPC»CL1:  intro  won.   We
couldn't  review  this  one,  since we
don't  have a PPC, but since »CL2:Dr.  Doom»CL1:
and I saw it on »CL6:MS»CL1:, we can say that we
think  it  is »CL0:primitive»CL1: and incredibly
»CL0:boring»CL1:.  Ok, first off, »CL0:3D scenes»CL1: tend
to  be  boring, but when they are this
bad-looking,  and »CL0:drag»CL1: on, without any
kind  of  »CL0:design»CL1:  or  »CL0:effect»CL1: on top of
them,  they  are  just »CL0:pointless»CL1:.  And
all this on PPC.  Now, statements were
made that this intro features realtime
raytracing.  And of course  the PPC is
capable  of  it (when you consider the
A500-copperscreen-style   resolution),
so  what  on earth is so »CL0:amazing»CL1: about
it?    It's  just  another »CL0: excuse»CL1:  to
produce   boring  »CL0:3D  scenes»CL1:  with  no
»CL0:design»CL1:.   Harsh  words  yes, but we do
believe in stating our »CL0:honest »CL1:opinion,
of   course   you   are   entitled  to
disagree.   As  it were, we think this
intro  should compete with the 2 first
we reviewed, for a placement.

And  now, on to the biggest part here,
the  reviews  of  the  »CL0:20 (!)»CL1: released
demos.   Be  prepared  for  some  »CL0:acid»CL1:
remarks here and there too, mwahah..


»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:                Demos
»CL1:--------------------------------------

First  off, the »CL0:placements »CL1:in the demo
compo,  with  the exception of the 3-4
top-most   ranked,  is  quite  »CL0:random»CL1:,
since everybody  voted  for the »CL0:top 5»CL1:,
leaving  »CL0:groupmembers»CL1:  and  »CL0:friends»CL1: to
vote  for their own demos, hehe.  As a
result,  placements from 20-5 are very
»CL0:random»CL1:  and  can be very »CL0:unfair»CL1: to the
people having spent time on the demos.
Also,  »CL0:one»CL1: vote more for many of these
demos,  and  they  would have advanced
3-5  ranks,  that few votes were given
to  them.  That's »CL0:undeserved»CL1: for some,
deserved  for others, naturally, let's
see what we think here..

»CL9:Freedom Arms/Void»CL1:

Well, this demo is an AMOS demo, coded
by  »CL2:Punisher»CL1:.   As  such, the routines
are  quite  »CL0:basic»CL1:, and the demo has no
chance     of    »CL0:impressing  »CL1:  people,
code-wise.   However, the routines are
somewhat  »CL0:cute»CL1:, I guess that's because
they're  so »CL0:retro»CL1:-looking, one can get
a  bit  of  »CL0:nostalgia»CL1: looking at them.
The  »CL0:music»CL1:  is  a  bit boring, but the
graphics  are  of  an ok quality, it's
nice to see the progression of »CL2:Malmis»CL1:,
the  graphician,  who  gets better and
better.

»CL9:Wormhole/Apathy»CL1:

Ok,  this  is  a »CL0:story»CL1: driven demo, of
the  »CL3:'Aliens  Invade'»CL1:  variety,  which
might  be  a  bit  »CL0:overdone»CL1:  now.   It
contains  a  nice  »CL0:soundtrack»CL1:,  has  a
sweet  overall »CL0:style»CL1:, and the graphics
are fine, while the effects there are,
are  quite  boring.   The  best  thing
about  this  demo  is the »CL0:pictures»CL1: and
the  »CL0:story»CL1:, which is maybe displayed a
bit too fast.  The ending is nice too,
although  this  demo only got the »CL0:19th»CL1:
place,   it  is  worth  watching,  and
should have been placed »CL0:much»CL1: higher.

»CL9:Kiss my Jazz/Appendix&PicSaintLoop»CL1:

Here  we have the same problem as with
»CL6:Melba»CL1:, probably because it is the same
system code.  The demo »CL0:multitasks»CL1:, but
the  »CL0:3D»CL1:  effects are »CL0:REALLY»CL1: slow.  The
same  demo  runs  at  »CL0:very»CL1:  reasonable
speed  on  the  030, so we must assume
this  is  a  »CL0:bug»CL1:  rather  than  eh,  a
slow engine. Hmm.. The demo is a short
»CL0:promotion   demo»CL1:  for  »CL6:Kizz  my  Jazz»CL1:,
»CL2:Jazzcats»CL1:    soon    to   be   released
»CL0:musicdisk»CL1:, and as such doesn't feature
much  more than some »CL0:3D»CL1: effects and an
ok,  »CL0:stylish»CL1:  tune.   The »CL0:startpicture»CL1:
was nice.

»CL9:Magic/Nah-Kolor»CL1:

Yes,  »CL0:here»CL1:  we  have  it..  Why have I
never thought about having a demo made
in  »CL2:IRIS »CL1: called »CL6:'Darkhawk'»CL1:.  No fair,
if  »CL2:Magic»CL1:  gets  it done in his search
for  ego-stimulation,  why not me too?
Uhm, but apart from that, we had a bit
of  trouble  actually reading the text
in the demo on our »CL0:14'»CL1: monitor.  It is
quite  »CL0:blurred»CL1:.   No, it's not because
we were drunk!  As always in »CL2:Nah-Kolor»CL1:
demos,  the  pictures  are  »CL0:top-notch»CL1:,
from  some  of the »CL0:best»CL1: graphicians in
the scene, and as usual, most pictures
get  shown  far  too  short a time, we
thought.   Actually  this demo is more
of  a  »CL0:slideshow»CL1:  than  a demo in some
aspects,  which  can be ok.  There are
some  standard, mostly »CL0:3D effects»CL1: too,
linking  the »CL0: pictures»CL1: as it were, and
the  techno  »CL0:soundtrack»CL1:  is  good,  if
maybe  a  bit too »CL0:advanced»CL1: and »CL0:slow»CL1: to
fit  the  demo.   »CL2:Dascon/IRIS»CL1: made the
modules  in  this  demo,  so »CL0:naturally»CL1:
they're  good, heh.  All in all, an ok
demo,  with  »CL0:so-so »CL1: effects, »CL0:very»CL1: good
graphics,  although  some disliked the
last  »CL2:Nah-Kolor»CL1:  logo, and good music.
The  design  and  linking of the parts
were  done ok too.  A »CL0:final»CL1: version of
this  demo  will  be  available  soon.
Maybe they'll  even  fix their  common
»CL0:interlace»CL1:  error,  which is typical of
many   »CL2:Nah»CL1:   demos   where   interlace
pictures  are  being  displayed  (this
error is only on »CL0:060»CL1: I think).

»CL9:Come on board/Loveboat»CL1:

Hehe,   this  one  was  »CL0:short»CL1:..   VERY
short.   Infact  it  exited  to WB/CLI
after »CL0:10 seconds»CL1:, so we can't say much
about that one.

»CL9:Welcome to our World 2/Darkage&IRIS»CL1:

»CL0:Best demo ever, should have won»CL1:!  Ohh,
»CL0:subjectivity»CL1:?   Well  ok,  on  another
note,  this is a »CL3:'humour'»CL1: demo.  Quite
»CL0:Monty  Python»CL1:  inspired,  made  by  »CL2:Mr
Tickle»CL1:  and  »CL2:Cupid»CL1:  (who  may  now  be
adressed only as »CL2:Dr.  Doom»CL1:).  As such,
I  guess  you  either »CL0:like»CL1: it, or »CL0:hate
it»CL1:.   It  contains  some  funny parts,
where  sceners  are  getting  into all
kind  of »CL0: embarrassing»CL1:  positions  and
effects, and also features a desperate
attempt  at  getting votes, by showing
my   curvaceous  »CL0:body»CL1:  in  the  start,
burning   a  cute  »CL0:kitten»CL1:  and  saying
»CL0:Windows    Sucks»CL1:.    Tsk,   tsk,   but
apparently   the  attempt  at  getting
votes   failed  miserably.   Seriously
though,  we  think it is a funny break
from the more »CL0:serious»CL1: demos, something
that  a lot of demo competitions could
use,  that is, if it is done »CL0:properly»CL1:,
and  not  too  »CL0:primitively»CL1:,  which  we
honestly  »CL0:don't»CL1:  think  this  one  is.
Still,  guess »CL2:DKG»CL1: and »CL2:IRIS»CL1: have to get
more  members,  so  that we could have
gotten more votes..

»CL9:Goes Lahti - RNO»CL1:

A »CL0:FINNISH»CL1: slideshow??  Yeah, we get to
watch  »CL2:THG»CL1:, »CL2: Kure»CL1:,  »CL2:Tundrah»CL1:,  etc., on
their  preparations  for the »CL6:MS»CL1:, which
mostly  include  »CL0:boozing»CL1:  in  Finland,
»CL0:boozing»CL1: on the trip, and»CL0: boozing»CL1:.  And
before  we  get  to  see  that, we are
treated   with   a   boring  and  long
»CL0:creditspart»CL1:.   »CLC:NO!»CL1:   We  are »CL0:NOT»CL1: angry
that  this one got more votes (barely)
than »CL6:Welcome to our World 2»CL1:!!  Ahemm..
The  code  is  very »CL0:primitive»CL1:, and the
pictures  are  not »CL0:compressed»CL1:.  That's
it.

»CL9:Light/IRIS»CL1:
Ok   then,   here  we  have  our  »CL0:main»CL1:
contribution  to  the  »CL6:MS»CL1:,  at  a »CL0:13th»CL1:
place.    Continuing   the   trend  of
slagging  people off, who do not spend
the  »CL0:required »CL1: amount of time on their
productions, but who just get together
one  week  before  a  party and cobble
some effects and »CL3:'design'»CL1: together, we
can critizise those blokes in »CL2:IRIS»CL1: for
doing  the  same.  Tsk, tsk, will they
never  »CL0:learn»CL1:?   Try spending some time
on  the  scene  wankers, or aren't you
»CL0:interested»CL1:  enough  in  the  scene for
that  effort?   Ouch..  Ok, apart from
that,  this  is a »CL0:cool»CL1: demo, we think.
It  contains some quite horrible »CL0:intro
gfx»CL1:, made in 5 minutes just before the
deadline,  but the »CL0:effects»CL1: are varied,
mostly  2D,  made  by  »CL2:Cupid»CL1:  (now »CL2:Dr.
Doom»CL1:,   don't   forget),   »CL2:Ransom»CL1:  and
»CL2:Tricktrax»CL1:, and in the traditional demo
style of »CL0:effect on effect»CL1:, linked by a
hard  and  excellent  »CL0:techno»CL1:  tune  by
»CL2:Nutman»CL1:.   Many of the »CL0:effects»CL1: are also
quite  good,  some  even »CL0:original»CL1:, the
demo   is  fastpaced  and  has  an  ok
»CL0:colorscheme»CL1:,  there  was even time for
some   »CL0:design»CL1:!    »CL2:Matarazzo»CL1:   did  the
fullscreen  pictures,  which are of an
»CL0:ok»CL1:  quality,  especially  the  »CL0:dolphin»CL1:
picture  is nice.  »CL0:Pixelled»CL1: of course,
like  God intended pictures to be.  It
might  astonish  you,  but  we  do NOT
think  this  demo  deserved such a low
placement.      Hehe,    but    that's
»CL0:subjectivity»CL1:   for   you,   watch   it
yourself  and  form  your own opinion.
Some   people  hate  this »CL0: traditional»CL1:
demostyle  and  prefer  »CL0:newer»CL1:  styles.
this demo also features more »CL0:code»CL1: than
most  other  demos  here, and the most
»CL0:different»CL1:  effects put together.  But,
enough of this, onwards to the next.

»CL9:Hetero Sapiens/Traktor»CL1:

From now on, we will »CL0:hate»CL1: and »CL0:slag off»CL1:
all demos,  since these all came above
ours,   and   we   will  start  here..
»CL2:Traktor»CL1:  is  a  small»CL0: norwegian»CL1: crew I
think,  who  have become more and more
active  lately.   That's  good.   They
also  have  their  own  notions  about
»CL0:design»CL1:,  which  it  doesn't  seem they
have copied from anybody else.  That's
good   too.    Ok,  apart  from  that,
linevectors  are  a  »CL0:bit»CL1:  dated, and a
brown  »CL0:colourscheme»CL1:  might be called..
ugly..  »CL0:Graphics»CL1:..  Well, as you could
»CL0:expect»CL1:.   The  music  was  somewhat ok
though.   So,  apparantly sceners like
»CL0:LINEVECTORS»CL1:   better   than  »CL0:unlimited»CL1:
»CL0:planes»CL1:,  »CL0:particleeffects»CL1:,  »CL0:raycasting»CL1:,
»CL0:ingenious  cubes»CL1:,  »CL0:voxelscapes»CL1:,  etc..
No  no,  NO  BITTERNESS!   Ahem, apart
from that, it's good to see a new crew
being  active, and I think I have even
written  an  article elsewhere in this
mag  about  how lame it is to slag off
new  groups  because  they  are  still
learning  to  »CL0:code»CL1:,  »CL0:paint»CL1:,  etc.,  so
nothing  »CL0:personal»CL1: against you »CL2:Traktor»CL1:,
EXCEPT that you..  Ehrr.  Ok ok, let's
go on.

»CL9:Serial Interference/Encore»CL1:

This  one  is easy, since it was a »CL0:PPC»CL1:
demo.   We promptly disregard this one
and jump on to the next
»CL9:Mocap/Flopi»CL1:

Doesn't run..  At all??

»CL9:April in Paris/Up Rough»CL1:

This   production  also  has  its  own
»CL0:style»CL1:,  and  again  it is a »CL3:'somewhat'»CL1:
new group doing it.  Theres a bit more
»CL0:substance»CL1:   to   this   demo   though,
although   we  also  have  »CL0:linevectors»CL1:
here,  hrmm.  We thought the»CL0: music»CL1: was
funky,   and   the   »CL0:code»CL1:   primitive.
There's  an  »CL0:animation»CL1:  of a train and
some  otherwise  ok »CL0:graphics»CL1: befitting
the style, which is ok.  But, while we
love »CL0:oldsk00l»CL1:, trying to get points by
stating  that this is »CL0:oldsk00l»CL1:, counts
negatively here, and besides, there is
too little »CL0:code»CL1: in this to deserve the
term.   Sure,  »CL0:linevector»CL1: is the first
demoroutine   ever   made,   and   the
»CL0:graphics»CL1:  are  retro, but that doesn't
make  it »CL0:oldskool»CL1:.  We could say more,
but  we  won't,  since we'd like to be
»CL0:friends»CL1:  with  the  nice  dudes  in »CL2:Up
Rough»CL1:, hehe.

»CL9:Artifictional/Secretly»CL1:

This  demo in  some ways reminds me of
our own »CL6:Quest»CL1:, which came..  Ehrr, 5th
(?)   on »CL6: MS99»CL1:.   This  demo  contains
almost   only   »CL0:3D   scenes»CL1:   made  in
»CL0:Lightwave»CL1:  (I'd guess), which is a bit
boring,  but  people  like  it.   What
reminds  me of Quest are the »CL3:'jumping'»CL1:
textures  in  Scicco's  3D engine too,
funny  seeing others who have the same
problem.  Besides that, the demo is »CL0:ok»CL1:
really,  there's a fine »CL0:greetingspart»CL1:,
the  »CL0:logo»CL1:  is  good  looking,  and the
»CL0:music »CL1:  is   ok  and  fits  the  demo,
although  it  is  nothing »CL0:spectacular»CL1:.
The  »CL0:zoomer»CL1:  and »CL0:endscroller»CL1: lack some
timing.

»CL9:The Squirt/3 Amigos»CL1:

First  off, this demo is either a huge
»CL0:rip»CL1: of all of »CL2:Exploders »CL1:intro effects,
or  otherwise  he has himself used all
his   intro   effects,   changed   the
palettes  a bit and »CL0:ANIMATED»CL1: all parts
where   »CL2:'3   Amigos'»CL1:   appear.   Since
»CL2:Exploder»CL1:  has  »CL0:sold»CL1: his Amiga and »CL0:quit»CL1:
the  scene,  since  we  think  even HE
would  not reuse his  own effects this
»CL0:shamelessly»CL1:,  only  changing  colours,
and  since  all parts stating who made
the  demo  seem  to  be »CL0:animations»CL1:, we
think  »CL2:3  Amigos»CL1:  are  just some dirty
»CL0:rippers»CL1:.   It  runs  without  sound on
»CL0:8mb»CL1:,  because there's no space.  Well,
sadly  it  had to run without sound on
our  »CL0:16mb»CL1:  fast  machine  too!  So, no
comment  about  the sound, except that
it  seems  like  it »CL0:precalcs»CL1: the whole
soundtrack  and  plays it as a »CL0:sample»CL1:.
There're no »CL0:pictures»CL1: either, and well,
»CL2:Exploders »CL1:  routines   are   nice  and
colourful, like they are in his »CL0:intros»CL1:
too.   Infact  all  of  his  different
routines  must  have  been ripped/used
for  this  demo, and that's why it got
this  placement  I'd  guess.   »CL0:Nothing
more to add.»CL1:

»CL9:Velocity/Creative Minds»CL1:

Another PPC demo, so..

»CL9:Subtle Shades 2/Nuance»CL1:

Wonderful  »CL0:start  »CL1:of this demo we must
say,  it  establishes a cute, »CL0:cartoony»CL1:
style  in  the  start,  with very nice
»CL0:pixel»CL1:  graphics  and  a  cool  way  of
displaying    »CL0:credits»CL1:.    Thumbs   up!
However,   then  the  demo  gets  more
»CL3:'modern'»CL1:,  with  quite  much 3D, sigh.
The  part  with  the cows is fine, but
the  »CL0:terminator»CL1:  head peeking though a
flying  object..   How many times have
we  seen that?  A question of making a
3D  scene  in  Lightwave, but it never
seems  to  go  out of »CL0:vogue»CL1:, heh.  The
»CL0:music»CL1:  is  also a bit boring, but gets
better  towards the end.  So, »CL0:graphics»CL1:
as  we like them, and a very promising
starting style, which is abandoned for
a  more  traditional  approach, and ok
routines, if nothing too inspiring.

»CL9:Adam Malysz vs. Wienerwurst/Ephidrena»CL1:

Another  »CL2:Ephidrena»CL1:  demo,  with  their
trademark  »CL0:style»CL1: of their demos before
»CL6:'J'»CL1:.   Fastpaced »CL0: technomusic»CL1:, »CL0:scanned»CL1:
images   of   various  people  fitting
perfectly  into  the overall design, a
black/white  flimmering overall style,
and  very  stylish  »CL0:effects»CL1:,  some  of
which  have  been  seen  in most other
»CL2:Ephidrena»CL1: demos.  So, all in all, this
is  a  really  good demo, the»CL0: music»CL1: is
engaging,  and  some  of  us »CL0:love»CL1: this
style,    while    others   think   it
»CL0:monotonous»CL1:  and  »CL0:uninspired»CL1:.   Hrmm, a
bit  of  a  disagreement there, but oh
well.   There's  a certain flair about
»CL2:Ephidrena»CL1:'s  demos, and this one is no
exception.   Stylish,  good,  visually
impressive,  engaging  and  a  »CL0:welcome
kick»CL1:  after  many  of the other demos.
The  best  demo  yet  in  this review,
in our overall opinion.

»CL9:Amsterdam Blessings/Mawi»CL1:

This  one,  like  the  »CL2:TBL»CL1: demo, needs
more  than  16  mb  of fastram to run.
Besides  that,  I think we have a more
thorough  review of this one elsewhere
in  the  mag, done by »CL2:Superk»CL1:.  Thus we
refer  you  to that article for a more
extensive review.



»CL9:Hotstyle Takeover/loonies»CL1:

So, after their, in the opinion of the
reviewers,     »CL0:horrid»CL1:    and  »CL0:  boring»CL1:
»CL6:Cybercinematastic»CL1:, which, featuring »CL0:3D
scenes»CL1:,  naturally won the last MS, we
will  try to hate this demo too, as is
only expected of us.

The  starting  part  has  a  very cool
»CL0:tunnel»CL1:  effect  linking  the 3D parts.
Although  this  tunnel  is  a  blatant
»CL0:rip-off»CL1:  of  the  »CL6:Valhalla»CL1: demo, it is
even  betterlooking than in that demo,
and  is the only positive thing we can
say  of the effects in the »CL0:first»CL1: part.
Otherwise this part contains boring 3D
scenes  with  some »CL0:fighting»CL1:, where the
moves are not as »CL0:ugly»CL1: and »CL0:unreal»CL1: as in
»CL6:Cybercinematastic»CL1:,  but  they're still
looking  quite  unreal,  and the whole
»CL0:part  1»CL1:  is  just an attempt to garner
votes   by  including  »CL0:3D  scenes»CL1:,  as
»CL2:Psycho»CL1: has also admitted himself.  The
music  in this part is ok, it's »CL0:techno
style»CL1:,  as  is  the  other module, and
both   are   fine  and  fitting.   The
»CL0:pictures»CL1:  in  this demo are so-so, the
rendered  »CL0:Terminator»CL1:  picture is cool,
the others have a »CL0:medium»CL1: quality.  But
now,    for    part,   where  »CL2: Loonies»CL1:
purposefully misquote (out of context)
poor »CL2:Cupid»CL1:.  That part is »CL0:GREAT»CL1:!  That
is  the demostyle we »CL0:like»CL1:, it contains
»CL0:fast»CL1:  effects,  »CL0:good »CL1: coding,  and one
really   gets   a   good  »CL0:demofeel»CL1:  by
watching  it.  Wonderful, and watching
this at MS, I was quite taken aback by
how  well  they succeeded in doing the
style I,  »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:,  prefer in a demo.
Therefore,  in  my  opinion,  »CL6:Hotstyle
Takeover»CL1:    should    have   won   the
democompetition.    »CL0:  Part     2»CL1:    is
professional, stylish, engaging and it
gave  me  a  »CL0:feeling»CL1: I thought I could
never   get   again,  after  almost  2
decades  of demowatching, a feeling of
really   being   »CL0:impressed»CL1:  with,  and
»CL0:liking»CL1:  a  demo.   Two  thumbs  up  to
»CL2:Loonies»CL1: for this one.

»CL9:Perfect Circle/TBL»CL1:

And  this is not to say that »CL0:this»CL1: is a
bad demo either, although our opinions
concerning this one are quite..  ehrr,
shall we say, »CL0:varied»CL1:.  Some think it's
the  best,  some  think  it's not that
good,  some  think it's »CL0:ok»CL1:.  The»CL0: music»CL1:
is very good and fits the demo nicely.
Although  it is a bit hard to put your
finger  on  why, the »CL0:design»CL1: is stylish
and   the  demo  seems  well-polished,
although  they  worked madly to finish
this  one  in  time, and the design is
not »CL0: as »CL1: well-polished  as  other  »CL2:TBL»CL1:
demos.   But  they  still  master  the
»CL0:technique »CL1:   of »CL0:   impressing »CL1:  people
visually,  without that much happening
on   the   screen,   especially  on  a
»CL0:bigscreen»CL1:.    The   demo   felt   very
professional  and  »CL0:captivating»CL1:  in its
style.  Worth noting positively is the
starting  »CL0:toiletscene»CL1:  and »CL0:credits»CL1:.  A
little   red   »CL0:vectorobject»CL1:   spinning
around  on  a scanned background while
credits fade in, how on earth can that
seem  professional and »CL0:stylish»CL1:?  Well,
some  have it, others don't, heh.  the
»CL0:forestzoomer »CL1: was  very  impressing on
the  bigsceen  too,  it's  a wonderful
effect,  although  apparently  not  as
hard to do as I first thought.  Still,
the most »CL0:impressive»CL1: effect in the demo
we  think.   Some  of  us  also really
liked  the  »CL0:waterreflection»CL1: effect and
the »CL0:fractalzoomer»CL1:, although it was not
»CL0:realtime»CL1:,  and  you'd  think  realtime
fractal  zoomers would become possible
»CL0:eventually»CL1:.     Also,   there's   this
impressive  3D scene taking you past a
»CL0:tree»CL1:  with  a  very  large  number  of
branches  (ie.   »CL0:polygons»CL1:).  The Mekka
audience  loved  that one, although it
later   turned   out   to  be  a  mere
»CL0:animation »CL1:  that   anyone  with  a  3D
rendering  utility could've made.  The
»CL0:3D  bubbles»CL1:  near the start could also
have  been done better »CL0:without»CL1: 3D, but
on the bigscreen they looked good, and
the  »CL0:whale scene»CL1: afterwards was and is
good.

So, that's it for reviews.  I think we
are   too  much  in  disagreement  for
ranking  the  demos as we thought they
should    have    been   placed,   but
personally, my »CL0:top 3»CL1: look like this:

»CL9:1. Hotstyle Takeover »CL1:
»CL9:2. Adam Malysz vs. Wienerwurst»CL1:
»CL9:3. Perfect Circle»CL1:

In  the  interest  of  »CL0:objectivity»CL1:,  I
won't  state  what demo I think should
have gotten the »CL0:4th place»CL1:, hahah!  And
with this, let's just end this review,
I  hope  you enjoyed it and can use it
for something.
