»CL1:
One  way  in which we can see that the
scene has grown »CL0:weaker»CL1:, »CL0:fainter»CL1: and of
course »CL0: smaller»CL1:,  is  by the fact that
there's  not as much »CL0:controversy»CL1: in it
anymore.   When  people  try  to write
something  »CL0:provocative»CL1:,  sceners  read
it,  feel nothing and pass over it, or
when  they  hear  about some»CL0: war»CL1: going
on,  they look puzzled for a bit, then
»CL0:forget »CL1: about  it.  This is sad, as it
seems  like  there's not much going on
anymore,  that can provoke »CL0:inspiration»CL1:
and »CL0:participation»CL1: from sceners.

Making    people's   blood   boil   is





generally  a  very good way of getting
said  people  to »CL0:engage»CL1: themselves and
be  motivated  in what's going on, and
as  such,  I  can  only heartily agree
with all points in »CL2:Spot's»CL1: »CL6:ST16»CL1: article
about  »CL2:Shane»CL1:.  Here was a guy who made
the  scene  »CL0:notice»CL1: him, who made a lot
of people wake up from their half-dead
slumber,  and  who  provoked  a lot of
»CL0:response»CL1:.  Now, what can we learn from
this?   Of  course  there's the simple
thing,  which many people have already
pointed   out,   that   »CL2:Shane»CL1:   is  an
incredible  »CL0: lamer »CL1: (or  a  damn  good
»CL0:actor»CL1:!),    but   what's   much   more
interesting   and  »CL0:important,»CL1:  is  the
feelings  he  did  actually provoke in
people.   Sceners  »CL0:engaged»CL1: themselves,
thought about the scene and him, wrote
articles  about him, and all the while
they  probably  felt  more  alive  and
motivated scene-wise than they usually
did.

My  point?  Easy, we quite simply NEED
to   be   »CL0:engaged»CL1:   and  »CL0:motivated»CL1:  by
something,  the most dangerous and sad
thing is if we just sit infront of our
computers,  partly out of a feeling of
»CL3:"well,   the  scene  is  kinda'  fun"»CL1:,
having    »CL0:forgotten»CL1:   what   made   us
interested  in  the scene in the first
place.    I'm   not   saying  we  need
destructive  »CL0:virus  spreaders»CL1:,  but we
need  some  sort  of »CL0: action»CL1:, »CL0: danger»CL1:,
»CL0:consequence»CL1:  and »CL0: controversy»CL1:  in  the
scene, because if this happens to some
field  we  are working in, and engaged
in,  we  will usually become even more
engaged   and  feel  more  »CL0:alive»CL1:  when
engaging ourselves in it.  And there's
much  too  little of this in the scene
today.   It's  probably most safe only
to speak of my »CL0:personal»CL1: experiences in
this  and  not  to  assume what others
feel,  but  I  will  wager a guess, by
extension,   that  many  of  you  feel
pretty »CL0:oblivious»CL1: to the scene for long
stretches  of  time.  You participate,
maybe   more   out   of   »CL0:habit»CL1:   than
everything  else,  but  the times when
you  feel  most  engaged  are when you
attend  »CL0:parties »CL1: or  produce something
for your »CL0:group»CL1:, naturally.  Now, after
many  years  of that, this might start
to  not feel like it's enough, and the
joy  of  this  »CL0:fades»CL1: somewhat, because
there's  less  and less »CL0:interaction»CL1: in
what you do.  It's not like you get 20
»CL0:emails»CL1:  in  your  mailbox  after  your
group   releases  something,  brimming
with  harsh  words and/or praise, it's
not like you start a »CL0:discussion»CL1: in the
scene  about  you  or  your group, and
it's  not  like  you actually feel you
can  shake  other  sceners »CL0:awake»CL1:.  You
feel  the  scene  becomes a place with
less»CL0:  energy »CL1: each  day  that  passes.
It's  simply  not  big enough for that
kind  of  engagement it had once, when
there    were    wars,    discussions,
appreciation  and  in  short,  »CL0:*life*»CL1:.
The  more  sceners who are active, the
more »CL0: happens»CL1:,  also apart from actual
releases,  and  the  more happens, the
more you get interested in your hobby,
the  brighter your flame of »CL0:creativity»CL1:
burns.   Now  though,  that flame is a
small  match  in  the  heart  of  most
sceners,  because  there's  simply not
enough »CL0:dedication »CL1:and »CL0:engagement»CL1: left.
Now,  people  like  »CL2:Shane»CL1: can rekindle
some  of  that  spirit, simply because
there's not much else happening.  It's
good  to  see that spark rekindled now
and   then,   almost  no  matter  »CL0:what»CL1:
accomplishes it, but the real point is
that  with  the  current  size  of the
scene,   and  the  engagement  of  the
current  sceners,  that  flame  is not
shining very bright right now.

What  is there to do?  Obviously it is
not  enough  to  »CL0:point this out»CL1: to the
scene,  that  is  hardly enough to get
them   all   up   and  running  about,
frantically   pouring   all  of  their
»CL0:energy»CL1:  into  the  scene.   As  it is,
sceners  would  do  just that, if they
felt  they  got  as  much back as they
gave, that is, if others started being
really  engaged and active again, they
would  be  »CL0:motivated »CL1: to  do the same.
Since  no  one  can  and will take the
first   step,   it   is  kinda'  hard.
Usually  it  is  up to the »CL0:diskmags»CL1: to
motivate  people when there's no party
around,   and   well,   we   know  our
»CL0:responsibility »CL1: and  try as hard as we
can, of course.  What we really needed
is  that  people  started  taking real
»CL0:pleasure»CL1:  in  their  scene work again,
and  really  put »CL0:love»CL1:, »CL0:time»CL1: and»CL0: effort»CL1:
into their productions again.  Some do
this,  naturally,  but  it  seems like
many  just  release  something after a
hasty  production  process,  and  lean
back   again,   watching   the   scene
sluggishly  move  forward.   Better to
really  give your soul and spirit to a
production, a cause, an article, etc.,
use the time needed and be a scener 24
hours a day in your mind, not just now
and then, when you feel it is »CL0:required»CL1:
of you.  It sounds frightening, but in
the  eighties and early nineties, when
we  were »CL0:sceners»CL1:, we thought about the
scene  once a minute atleast, we lived
and  breathed  for  the scene, and the
rest  of  our  life  was  some kind of
shadow  existence we had to go through
to  have time to be sceners too.  Yes,
I  know,  this  is  certainly  not  as
»CL0:feasible»CL1:  anymore,  but  the  point is
that  when  it  was  feasible,  partly
because  all  other  sceners were like
this,  because the scene was that big,
and  because we were young»CL0: schoolkids»CL1:,
we »CL0:LOVED»CL1: it.  We were engaged and felt
that  the  more  we  gave, the more we
got.   Gradually, some people got more
»CL3:'life' »CL1: though,  more  responsibility,
and  the  scene  got  smaller,  no new
»CL0:youngsters»CL1: stepped up to take over and
give  their  lives to the scene, so it
was  still  on  our shoulders to carry
the scene onwards.  The scene changed,
and flowed slower and slower.  In fact
we did not really»CL0: want»CL1: it to change in
this  way,  but over the years, it has
changed  without  us really being able
to  stop it, and as a consequence, our
lives  as sceners changed, it got less
»CL3:'flowing'»CL1:,  it  required  more  mental
effort  to  work  on  something in the
scene,  and  the joy got less, because
the  overall  joy  of  the sceners got
less..  Ohh yes, a dangerous downwards
»CL0:spiral»CL1:.  And not even one we can stop,
as  things  stand now, what we need is
more  »CL0:influx »CL1:of engaged »CL0:newcomers»CL1:, and
that  is  only partly in our own power
to manage.

We  can  »CL0:slow»CL1: this spiral down, try to
have more »CL0:fun»CL1: in what we do, mainly by
working  and  partying  together  with
other  sceners,  to  have engaging and
»CL0:loyal »CL1: groups.   We can try to provoke
other sceners into getting their »CL0:spark»CL1:
rekindled,  so that they in turn, will
provoke   others   into  »CL0:participating»CL1:
again,  and  so  on.  Therefore, as it
is, the scene really needs every shred
of »CL0:  motivation»CL1:   it   can   get,  and
therefore »CL2: Shane»CL1: has to get (indirect,
to  be sure) »CL0:respect»CL1: for accomplishing
this.   Also, »CL6:Devotion #2»CL1: needs to get
respect,    atleast   from   me,   for
motivating and engaging me when I read
it.   We need these things, and infact
we  like it, deep down, no matter what
kindles this spark.

So, you lazy good-for-nothing »CL0:suckers»CL1:,
how    about   wiping   that   »CL0:apathic»CL1:
expression  from  your »CL0:ugly»CL1: faces, and
get»CL0: engaged »CL1:again, eh??
