»CL5:                             by Loaderror/Ephidrena
»CL1:
The »CL0: inspiration»CL1:  for  this  demo came
just   after   the   release   of  our
»CL6:"Concrete"»CL1:   demo   at »CL6:  The   Party»CL1:..
something.  The thing about »CL6:"Concrete"»CL1:
was  that  it  wasn't very »CL0:consistent»CL1:,
and  had a lot of change in styles all
the  time.   From grainy »CL0:photos»CL1: stolen
from  the  internet  with  routines on
them  to  plasma tunnels and»CL0: Kiss»CL1: like
versions of the »CL2:Ephidrena»CL1: crew.

We   (or   I  atleast)  wanted  to  do
something   along  the  lines  of  the
photos, but do it more and better.  So
I   borrowed   a   »CL0:digitalcamera»CL1:   and





together  with  my  friend »CL2: Gaerpe»CL1:, we
went   to  school  to  take »CL0: pictures»CL1:.
»CL2:Gaerpe»CL1:,  which  means »CL0:"throwing up"»CL1: in
his  obscure  dialect  from  hell, has
secret  »CL0:underground»CL1:  knowledge  of the
inner  workings  and  machinery of our
school.   So a better partner for this
dirty work (but somebody had to do it)
couldn't be found.

We took our »CL0:digitalcamera»CL1: and drove up
to school after everybody had left the
building.   At  first  sight there was
nothing  that  had  the name »CL3:"hardcore
demo  material"»CL1:  written  on it.  Just
boring  »CL0:classrooms»CL1:, and the occasional
»CL0:trashcan»CL1:  and »CL0:sink»CL1:.  No rotting bodies
or  bugs crawling out from huge cracks
in  the  walls.  No»CL0: particles»CL1: or »CL0:cloud»CL1:
»CL0:zoomers»CL1:   in  there  either.   What  a
boring school.

But   Gaerpe   knew   of   some   »CL0:dark»CL1:
technological  rooms  of »CL0:death»CL1:, and as
we  dived into the murky depths in the
»CL0:janitors»CL1:   domain   I  could  feel  my
inspiration  starting  to grow.  There
were »CL0:pipes»CL1:, old broken »CL0:monitors»CL1:, dirty
circuit boxes with »CL0:wires »CL1:hanging bare,
»CL0:ventilation»CL1:  ducts.   In  short, every
demo   makers  »CL0:dream»CL1:.   We  took  some
pictures   of   the   pipes  carefully
adjusting  the  angle of everything in
order  to  make  the composition neat.
These  pictures were stored in »CL0:640x480»CL1:
in  the  camera,  a format which would
make every »CL0:pc»CL1: owner moan and complain,
but  four  times  the  size of what we
»CL0:usually»CL1: display on our cruddy monitors
with  »CL0:hardware»CL1:  blur.   Circuit boxes,
pipes,  monitors  and the antennas and
parabolas  on  the  roof were captured
onto the digital film.  I was »CL0:happy»CL1:.

And  then,  as  we hit the »CL0:lights»CL1: in a
murky  little  room.  Behind the pipes
and  old  metal  a  »CL0:cardboard  box»CL1: was
hidden  away  for none to see.  Filled
with anxiety and determination, »CL2:Gaerpe»CL1:
got  dirty on the floor and pulled out
the  »CL0:secret »CL1: cardboard  box.  And what
»CL0:treasure»CL1: we had discovered!!  The »CL0:dark»CL1:
janitor   from  »CL0:hell»CL1:  had  hidden  his
sticky »CL0:porn»CL1: magasines in the cardboard
box.   The  janitors  private »CL0:pornbox»CL1:.
The  doublecrosser.   What  would  the
boring   lecturers  say  if  this  was
revealed  for the public?  Well, after
discussing the art of jerking off in a
pornmagazine  for  a very short while,
there  was  much  laughter and we went
back  to taking pictures again.  After
all,  we  dont put naked chicks on our
effects   like   all  the  other  »CL2:CNCD»CL1:
»CL0:wannabe»CL1: groups do.

»CL0:Coder:»CL1:   "Here's  a  naked woman, that
will fit nicely to my new RGB coloured
texturemapped tunnel".

»CL0:Graphician:»CL1:   "Yeah,  I'll  just touch
her  up  in »CL0:24bit»CL1: and then add lots of
stupid »CL0:pinks»CL1: and »CL0:greens»CL1: to her face so
that  she'll remap really badly to the
»CL0:256 RGB colours»CL1: in the background"

»CL0:Musician:»CL1:   "And  I'll add a real crap
»CL0:technotune »CL1: with  sampleloops from all
the known ambient groups on top".

»CL0:Organiser:»CL1:   "Yeah, and we have to add
some »CL0:text»CL1: saying »CL0:poetic things»CL1: aswell,
that  will  look really »CL0:passionate»CL1: and
»CL0:professional»CL1:".

and  then  we have the demo ready.  oh
yeah..  I »CL0:love»CL1: it!!!!!

Well,  back to the photographic devils
»CL2:Gaerpe»CL1:  and »CL2: Loaderror»CL1:.  Now »CL6:trsac»CL1: was
heading  our  way,  and the persuasive
»CL2:Booster»CL1:  started  picking  on me every
hour  on  »CL0:IRC»CL1: wondering about when our
»CL6:TRSAC»CL1:  demo  would be released.  So in
furious  anger  I  sat up all night at
»CL2:Gaerpes»CL1:  place coding the »CL0:"turn up the
hype»CL1:"  demo  using  one of the antenna
photos from the roof of the school.  I
thought  about  it  as a promotion for
the  final  demo, which I wanted to be
an   »CL0:alien  »CL1: based   demo   using  the
oldschool  »CL3:"invaders"»CL1: from the arcades
as  aliens.   But (gladly) the rest of
the  crew  didn't  really  become that
awfully  »CL0:inspired»CL1:  by  my  idea.   And
today im really glad for that.  What a
»CL0:crap »CL1:idea anyway.  »CL2:Frequent»CL1: still made
a  couple of tracks, but as I was just
moaning    and    didn't   fancy   his
»CL0:interpretation»CL1:  of  what I had in mind
that  much, the whole thing died down.
The  only  thing  that was left of it,
was  the »CL0: UFO»CL1:  and  the  words  saying
something  equally  cool as »CL3:"the truth»CL1:
»CL3:is  out  there"»CL1: or »CL3:"they're coming for»CL1:
»CL3:you"»CL1:..   what  was  it again?  Anyway,
people  thought that this was going to
be the title of the next demo and they
asked me:"When is »CL6:"The truth is coming
for you"»CL1: going to be out?" at frequent
intervals.

With    all    this   »CL0:hype»CL1:,   and   no
»CL0:inspiration»CL1:,  I  kind  of»CL0: scrapped »CL1:the
project  and  left the pictures on the
disk.   In  the  meantime  we did some
smaller  productions  like, »CL6: omnicrom»CL1:,
»CL6:bier»CL1:, »CL6: kina»CL1:, »CL6: børst»CL1:, »CL6: janne ahonen»CL1: and
»CL6:pluss»CL1:.  »CL2:Cheetah»CL1: had started to pixel a
little on the pictures I had sent him.
They  were  better  than  the  ones in
»CL6:"Concrete"»CL1: but they were still »CL0:grainy»CL1:,
so he decided to »CL0:repixel»CL1: them all in a
certain »CL0:style»CL1: of colours and technique
so  that  the style became uniform and
»CL0:clean»CL1:.   A  very  daunting  task this.
I'll  remind you that there were about
»CL0:20»CL1:  pictures  and they were in »CL0:640x480»CL1:
resolution.   And I couldn't guarantee
which »CL0: ones »CL1: we  would use.  He didn't
doo  all  of  them.   But  a  few were
wasted  away by not having appropriate
routines.   (Don't you graphicians out
there just love to »CL0:pixel»CL1: for »CL0:hours»CL1: and
then the coder says:»CL3:"NO!!!"»CL1:)

»CL6:The  Party»CL1: was getting closer.  We had
some »CL0:pictures»CL1:, some »CL0:sound»CL1:, but not the
sound  we  »CL0:wanted»CL1:.   We (mostly me and
»CL2:cheetah»CL1:)   were   imagining   a   dark
industrial  type  of  mood  with  slow
off-beat    beats   (nice   sentence).
»CL0:Autechre»CL1: meets »CL0:drum'n'bass»CL1: maybe.  The
intro  tune  by  »CL2:Frequent»CL1: was in there
already  and was pretty spot on what I
was looking for.  The closest match to
our  ideas  concerning the main tune ,
was  »CL2:Teis'»CL1:  module »CL6:"Lite Technology"»CL1: a
really  cool tune.  But as we have our
own  musicians that can make all sorts
of music, we decided to leave it up to
them  instead.   And  there are always
»CL0:compromises»CL1:.

We wanted some mellow organic parts in
there as well, without any »CL0:synthesizer»CL1:
instruments.   The »CL2: Zixaq»CL1:  man  made a
little  »CL0:preview»CL1:  of a song featuring a
really  fast  drum'n'bass  beat with a
couple   of   weird   sounds  and  the
occasional   friendly   melody.    Too
friendly  infact,  but  he loved these
parts  a  lot.   So there was only one
thing to do.

It  was  getting  darker,  too dark to
see.   The »CL0:bloodthirsty»CL1: graphician and
the  unfriendly  coder  with no social
intelligence  blended in with the dark
night.   They  had  just gotten of the
bus  to»CL0: Volda»CL1: where »CL2:Zixaq»CL1: lived in his
studying   days  .   They  were  on  a
mission  of  hardcoreness for the sake
of  saving  »CL6:The  Party »CL1: demo from soft
»CL0:pinks»CL1:  and  bright  »CL0:happy faces»CL1:.  "You
got    the    crowbar?"    said    the
acne-scarred  coder.  "Yeah, of course
you    acneloser"    said   the   »CL0:evil»CL1:
graphician  Cheetah,  who was mentally
»CL0:damaged»CL1:  by  having the dumbest»CL0: handle»CL1:
in  the  world.   "Shut  up,  I have a
dumber  handle  than  you",  said  the
coder  with  a  sick grin on his face.
After some swift craftmanship with the
crowbar,  they  were  inside.  Why had
»CL2:Zixaq»CL1:, the »CL0:e91 mastahh»CL1:, gone so »CL0:soft»CL1:?

As  they  approached  the bedroom, the
reason became violently apparent.  The
luscious sounds of »CL0:sweet loving»CL1: filled
the  apartment  with »CL0:joy »CL1:and »CL0:pleasure»CL1:.
»CL2:Zixaq»CL1:  had  gotten  a »CL0:girlfriend»CL1:.  The
two  »CL2:Ephidrena»CL1:  members that never got
any  girls, were disgusted by this and
started  throwing»CL0: garbage »CL1:all over the
floor.   Screaming  Amiga  slogans and
extracts      of      »CL3:"old     ancient
untranslatable code"»CL1: a big hole opened
up  from  nowhere  and  sucked all the
love   in   the   air   into  »CL0:infinite
darkness»CL1:.   All  the  »CL0:candles»CL1:, all the
healthy »CL0:cooking ingredients»CL1:.  The only
thing left in the room was hard »CL0:steel»CL1:,
»CL0:concrete»CL1: and old »CL0:pizza»CL1: leftovers. From
the   bedroom   there  was  screaming.
»CL2:Zixaqs»CL1:  girlfriend came running out of
the  door  white  as  a corpse running
»CL0:naked »CL1: into the streets of Volda.  The
guerilla   pixler  and  the  assembler
terrorist once again felt happiness as
they   saw  their  friend  inside  the
bedroom  roaring  old »CL0:tracker»CL1: commands
and  carving  the  letters  »CL3:"Ephidrena
rules  again"»CL2:  into the walls with his
own  blood.   »CL2:E-P-H »CL1: was  born  again.
»CL2:Frequent»CL1:  didn't  do  much out of this
though..   To calm the exploding wrath
of  »CL2:Zixaq»CL1:  down, »CL2:Loaderror»CL1: slapped him
in  the  face  with  a  lump of frozen
pizza until he was tamed.

As  a  result of this, the happy parts
»CL0:disappeared»CL1: because »CL2:Zixaq»CL1: stayed angry
the  next  morning.   The guitar parts
were  not  touched  though, because we
all  agreed  on  that  they  were very
nice.   They  are  of course played by
the  mean  guitar player »CL2:Zixaq»CL1: himself
in  a  mellow acoustic setting.  (Dont
you  just  feel  the  sunrise in those
tones?)  To  say  something  about the
»CL0:code»CL1:.   Which  is  some  recycling  as
usual, but a lot of »CL0:fixing»CL1: was made in
the  shadetables  system (again) which
now  picks better colours than before.
The  »CL0:cloudvoxel»CL1: stuff was written from
scratch  and the »CL0:cloud zoomer»CL1: also.  I
made  a  realtime  anti  aliasing »CL0:anim»CL1:
replayer  (which  is  really crap) and
altered   the   »CL0:tunnel »CL1:  interpolation
slightly :D.  The most boring parts to
code   were  the  parts  with  the  3D
particles  and objects that should fit
into  the  real  world.   It took some
tweaking   before   they   would  look
acceptable.  The 3D tunnel coordinates
didnt  match  my  other 3D coordinates
either,  so  I spent some hours trying
to make it look»CL0: realistic»CL1: :D.

From  here  it  was  all designing and
fighting                          over
»CL3:"this-part-of-the-music-won't-fit-to-t
his-routine-and-these-graphics"»CL2:
demomaking.  We had some »CL0:meetings»CL1:, but
at  one  meeting  I ended up doing the
»CL6:Showtime»CL1: intro instead.  The other one
was  more  of  a  big lift to make »CL6:The
Party»CL1:  deadline  reachable,  as  there
were   lots  of  »CL0:coordination»CL1:  between
music  and  code to be made.  The last
routines were made before »CL6:The Party»CL1: on
the »CL0: boat»CL1:  actually.  The particles in
the  start  of  part  2,  aswell as an
asteroid   field   which  we  scrapped
because  it  didn't  really  fit  with
»CL0:asteroids »CL1: in  there.   The linevector
with  particles  in it was done at »CL6:The
Party»CL1:.     »CL2:Browallia/Nukleus»CL1:   reacted
positively  to  it,  so  we left it in
there :).

At »CL6: The  Party»CL1:  we spoke to some scene
people  who  had bothered to go there.
»CL2:Chaos»CL1:  for  example,  who made me feel
like   a  »CL0: wuzz »CL1:  after   seeing   his
intro(thanks for the inspiration).

The  compo,  the  disaster,  the  true
story.   Things  were  going  downhill
from  here.  »CL0:Deadline »CL1:turned out to be
3  hours  before we had expected it to
be.   And  as a result of that, we had
to  include a »CL0:half finished »CL1:version of
the  mountain  graphics  which frankly
speaking,   looked  like  a  »CL0:lollipop»CL1:.
Maybe it would have fit in »CL6:"Tint"»CL1:, but
not in»CL0: this»CL1: demo.  So we ended up with
some  purples  and  softies (grrr!!!).
After delivering the demo a little bit
late  to  some  helpful »CL0:organisers»CL1:, we
discovered   that   the   archive  was
corrupt     because    of    a    crap
»CL0:filesplitter»CL1:.    So   we  ran  to  the
information desk with the corrupt file
and  then  to  the  democrew  which at
first  wanted  to  »CL0:throw  us  out»CL1:, but
later turned out to be helpful enough.
Then   I   noticed   something  a  bit
»CL0:dubious»CL1:.   We  had  to insert the disk
three  times into the diskdrive of the
a4000 compomachine for it to »CL0:recognise»CL1:
it.  I don't like A4000's at all.  Why
do  they  always  have  to  use  these
»CL0:garbagemachines»CL1: for compomachines when
we  dont  use  the  hardware they have
inside  it  anyway?  And even a partly
»CL0:broken»CL1: one?

Atleast  everything  seemed  to  be in
»CL0:order»CL1:  now.   We  tested  the  demo on
»CL2:Cheetahs»CL1:  060 and it ran fine.  I went
drinking  outside,  and the others did
something.    In   the  meantime,  the
organisers failed to run the demo with
setpatch.    Probably  because  of  my
polygonclipper  routine.  But this bug
only occured on the compo machine, but
not  on  ours.  So the organisers then
announced  somewhere  on their webpage
that there was an »CL0:error»CL1: with our demo.
But  being  the  Amiga  »CL0:freaks»CL1: that we
are,   we   didn't   really  get  that
message.   The  strange  thing is that
none  of  our »CL0: Amiga»CL1: friends which had
net  told us anything about it either.
Neither  did  we  hear anything on the
»CL0:speaker»CL1: system(but, I was out »CL0:drinking»CL1:
remember).  So they ended up recording
it  »CL0:without  setpatch»CL1:.  Arghhhh!!  (im
repeating    my   fellow   gangstahman
»CL2:Cheetah»CL1:'s article from »CL6:showtime»CL1: here).
Although  »CL2:Farbrausch»CL1:  got to record on
their  own computer..  hmpf.  ah well,
you  know  the rest of the story.  The
»CL0:coder»CL1: demo won.  prrt.  fart..  I dont
really have anything really bad to say
about  that,  but  a  »CL0:fair»CL1: competition
would  have  been  nice.  They spelled
our  name  wrong  on  the  prizegiving
too:»CL3:"Erhidrena"»CL1:.   We  sounded  like a
fucking »CL0:kebabcrew»CL1:..

The   rest  of  The  Party  was  spent
drawing cartoons of the »CL0:organisers»CL1: and
»CL2:haujobb»CL1:  members  in various dangerous
and  »CL0:nonheterosexual»CL1:  situations.  But
no offence.  Just moaning on our part.
We'll  probably  kick  your ass in the
next  demo compo we enter.  But not on
this party :)

Hmm..   well,  should I tell you about
the making of »CL6:"Adam Malysz"»CL1:?  Probably
not  now.   This article's getting way
too  »CL0:serious»CL1:.  I dont like too serious
articles.

A  greeting to all those who liked »CL6:J'_»CL1:
(its  not  really  a  »CL0:J»CL1:, its a symbol,
which  »CL2:Stoney »CL1: drew.   We wanted to do
like   »CL0:Prince»CL1:   you  see.   The  group
formerly  known  as »CL2:Ephidrena»CL1:.  hehe..
coming  kicking up your ass!!!  But as
we  realised  that  Prince was »CL0:gay»CL1:, we
decided not too.  Gay people dont have
»CL0:children»CL1:  you  know.   And  they stick
their  dicks in you when you drop your
»CL0:soap»CL1:  in  the  shower.   Slippery soap
bastards.  Soap-series suck..  yeah.)
