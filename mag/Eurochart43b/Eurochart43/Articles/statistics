»CL1:I got the idea »CL1:for this article after
doing the Polish Eurochart article»CL1:
last time. While I would not want to
repeat that particular counting feat,
»CL0:I thought it might be interesting »CL1:for
some to see from which countries we
get our votes. If nothing else, I
would like to see this myself, and
this might become a recurring
feature of the mag. It is somewhat
easy to do, since I know where most
voters live. This should also give us
a »CL4:good indication »CL1:of which countries
are the biggest in the scene, and as
such, will be »CL4:interesting to study »CL1:as
the »CL4:years pass»CL1:. Well, it can also
show us what countries are in the
habit of voting for the EC of course,
and what people are most interested in
the EC, but I think that the numbers
are a bit too low for that kind of
deduction. Anyway, for this issue, we
had »CLA:103 voters»CL1:, and according to
country, the votes even out like this:
                   »PIC:unknown1.iff»

»CLA:Poland      - 20

»CL4:Denmark     - 14
»CL3:Norway      - 13
»CL2:Finland     - 12
»CL1:Germany     - 11
»CL1:Sweden      - 8
»CL1:England     - 6 
»CL1:Netherlands - 5 »PIC:darklight-ec4.iff»
»CL1:Russia      - 3
»CL1:Hungary     - 2
»CL1:Italy       - 2
»CL1:Spain       - 2
»CL1:USA         - 2
»CL1:Czech. Rep. - 1
»CL1:France      - 1

»CL4:Russia »CL5:beats the »CL4:U.S. »CL1:in amount of
votes for the EC atleast, heh. Other
than that, it is no surprise that
»CLB:Poland »CL1:must get credit for the »CLB:biggest»CL1:
amount of votes, since by all
accounts, they are the biggest scene
country today. Still, Denmark is one
of the smallest, practically more 
than »CL4:half »CL1:of the »CL4:sceners in Denmark 
»CL1:have »CL4:voted»CL1: for the EC this time, 
that's good, if it would be the same
with Poland, we'd get an extra 100
votes I'd guess! As for the amount of
votes overall, it is not surprising
either, the traditionally biggest and 
most active countries are also the
ones supplying us with votes. Still,
»CL2:Hungary »CL1:and the »CL2:Czech Republic »CL1:have a
»CL4:bigger scene »CL5:than these numbers show»CL1:,
and so does Spain and France, atleast 
I hope so. Otherwise, a lot of sceners
from these countries have really died 
off rather fast.

Nothing more to say in this short
article, but you're welcome to »CLA:give us
feedback»CL1:. Do you think this is a good
idea for a recurring column, or can't
you see the use in this country
listing? And before you ask, no, I am
too lazy to divide the votes into
groups too, although that could surely
be interesing.
