Hello  and »CL0:welcome»CL1: to another issue of
»CL6:The Official Eurochart»CL1: (how many times
do we have to »CL0:spell»CL1: it for you, before
you realize it is not Eurochart»CL4:s»CL1:?  Ohh
well..),  this time it's issue »CL0:43»CL1:, and
yes,  it's true, we had a»CL0: delay»CL1: in the
release  of  this one.  Not the worlds
longest  delay  at  all, but still a 1
month  or so delay.  Well, things have
been  sorted  out,  and  the EC 43 has
been  released.  Notice that there are
some »CL0:changes»CL1: in the whole »CL6:EC»CL1: hierachy,
yours   truly,   »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:,   is  still
»CL0:maineditor»CL1:  naturally,  and »CL2:Adonis»CL1: has
stepped  into  »CL2:Cytron's»CL1: place.  In the
he    will    be    responsible    for
»CL0:votecounting»CL1:,  »CL0:news&adverts»CL1: and in the
future    probably   »CL0:c»CL1:o»CL2:l»CL3:o»CL4:u»CL6:r»CL8:i»CL6:z»CL9:i»CL3:n»CL1:g»CL1:   and
»CL0:formatting»CL1:,  so  he  has  just  gotten
himself   the   most  boring  »CL0:slavejob»CL1:
available here, heeeh.

This is also the last issue which is a
coproduction  between  »CL2:Depth»CL1: and»CL2: IRIS»CL1:,
from  the  next  issue, »CL2:IRIS»CL1: will take
over the chart completely.  Thanks for
the  job  you've  done on »CL0:14 EC issues»CL1:
»CL2:Depth»CL1:,  and  thanks  to  »CL2:Curt Cool»CL1: and
»CL2:Cytron»CL1:  for  stepping  in  when »CL2:Static
Bytes»CL1:  stepped out, reviving this cool
»CL0:chartmag»CL1:.

Therefore,  if  this issue looks a bit
»CL0:poor»CL1: in regards to general setup, it's
because  we had to learn how to do all
the things that »CL2:Cytron»CL1: usually did, in
a short amount of time, so we count on
your understanding while we familarize
us  with this code and way of editing,
and  introduce  massive  code  changes
into the »CL6:EC»CL1: over time.

We must remember to state here that if
you  think  the »CL0:advert »CL1:section in this
issue of the »CL6:EC »CL1:looks exactly like the
section  we  had  in  »CL0:issue 42»CL1:, that's
because   it  »CL0: is»CL1:   infact  the  same.
»CL2:Adonis»CL1:, decided to reuse the old ones,
because  he  didn't think there'd been
any  changes in them anyway.  Now, you
might  think  this is an »CL0:efficient»CL1: way
of handling things, or you might think
it is utterly »CL0:lame»CL1:, but PLEASE, do not
write  an EC slag off article accusing
»CL0:ME»CL1: of being responsible for this.

You  see,  for  this  issue of the »CL6:EC»CL1:,
»CL2:Azzaro»CL1:  has  written  quite  an attack
against   me,  which  we've  naturally
published,   and  which  I  have  also
answered  in these pages.  I might add
that  »CL2:KNG»CL1:  is »CL2:Kangooroo»CL1:, not »CL2:Kengooroo»CL1:
»CL2:Azzaro»CL1:,     that     you    completely
misunderstood   my  »CL0:sarcastic»CL1:  »CL2:Loonies»CL1:
quote,  and  that I am not responsible
for »CL0: everything»CL1:  that  goes  on in the
»CL6:EC»CL1:,  so  please check your own facts a
little   more  before  writing.   Uhm,
anyway,  I  have already answered that
article   as   much   as  it  »CL0:deserves»CL1:
elsewhere.

This  issue  of  the  chart is heavily
influenced  by the recently held »CL6:Mekka
Symposium»CL1:   party.   A  lot  of  Amiga
productions   were   released   there,
especially  in the »CL0:democompo»CL1:.  »CL6:Perfect
Circle»CL1:  by TBL managed to do something
quite  extraordinary,  that  is, going
staright  to the »CL0:2nd place»CL1: in the »CL0:Best
Demo»CL1:  chart,  only surpassed by »CL6:Relic»CL1:.
Will   be   interesting  to  see  what
happens  next  issue,  whether we will
finally   see »CL6: Relic»CL1:  bow  down  to  a
»CL0:newcomer »CL1:  or  not.   Other  »CL6:MS»CL1:  demos
managed  to  get  onto  the  Best Demo
chart, and also some intros managed to
get  on  the  »CL0:4k »CL1: and  »CL0: 40k/64k»CL1:  intro
charts.   All in all, »CL6:MS»CL1: this year was
a  »CL0:monumental»CL1:  happening for the Amiga
scene,  and we hope next years »CL6:MS»CL1: will
be just as good, or better.

In the magpart, we have 2 partyreports
from  the  »CL6:MS»CL1:,  production »CL0:reviews»CL1: and
some  miscellaneous  stuff  about  the
party,  we  hope  you  will  like  our
coverage  of this event.  We also have
lots  of  other  articles  for  you of
course,  including  a  lenghty diskmag
review like you should be getting used
to,  of  »CL6:ST16»CL1:  and  »CL6:DVN2»CL1:.   And »CLC:Coders
Corner»CL1:  makes a return.  Let's see how
many  passages  »CL2:Loonies »CL1: can manage to
misquote from it »CL0:this»CL1: time, hehe.

Lastly..   I  would  like  to announce
that »CL2:Cupid»CL1:, being easily influenced by
the  other people present at our small
2  week  »CL0:summermeeting»CL1:,  where  we are
putting  together  this  »CL6:EC»CL1: (and a new
»CL0:slideshow»CL1:,  which  I  won't  advertize
here, because..  That would be »CL0:cheap»CL1:..
It's  out  in  »CL0:August»CL1:, remember that..
Ehh), has »CL0:renamed»CL1:.  And he has renamed
to..  Take a deep breath..  »CLB:Dr.  Doom!»CL1:
So, don't be alarmed when you see that
»CL2:Dr.    Doom»CL1:   has  written  a  lot  of
articles,   and  the  complete  coders
corner,  it's  ex.  »CL2:Cupid»CL1:, as you know
him.    I  myself  am  thinking  about
changing  my handle into »CL2:Galactus»CL1:, but
I admit I may be too much of a »CL0:chicken»CL1:
to do it..

Well,  that's  it, enough blabber, now
go read the »CL6:EC»CL1:!
