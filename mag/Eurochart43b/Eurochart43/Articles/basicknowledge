»CL1:
This  is  a  small article about basic
»CL0:knowledge»CL1: of the scene.  To say more -
I   think  that  the  authors  of  the
»CL6:Eurochart»CL1:  are  »CL0:pissing»CL1:  sceners  »CL0:off»CL1:.
Mainly»CL0:   polish »CL1:  sceners,   but  also
others.   Proofs?  Tons of»CL0: mistakes»CL1: in
each issue of the magazine and a bunch
of »CL0: gossip»CL1:  treated as pure »CL0:facts»CL1:.  If
someone  can count all the bugs inside
every new issue you can see that there
are  more  symptoms of »CL0:distortion»CL1: than
pure scene related »CL0:information»CL1:...

I just took a deeper look at»CL2: Darkhawks»CL1:
article    about   »CL0:polish »CL1:  charts   -





everything  is allright, i »CL0:respect»CL1: his
point   of  view  and  don`t  want  to
criticise  the  large  aspect  of this
article.   I  just  worry  about those
small  »CL0:mistakes »CL1: and  typical»CL0: bugs»CL1:.  I
realize  »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:  is  responsible for
»CL0:collecting»CL1: votes and »CL0:counting»CL1: them for
every  issue.   I can focus only on my
own  group  -  »CL2:Mawi»CL1:,  because  I`m the
leading  organiser  of this team.  I`m
sick  about  fighting  with  all those
lamers  who  »CL3:"fix"»CL1:  the group name all
the  time.  There is only one group in
the   scene  named  »CL2:"Madwizards"»CL1:  (one
word!!!),  in  short simply »CL2:"Mawi"»CL1: and
our   prefix   before  every  official
release  name  is »CL0:"MWI"»CL1:, ok?  No other
combinations  with  »CL0:"v"»CL1:  or  two words
names  are allowed so please don`t use
them  and  »CL0:LEARN»CL1:  how to »CL0:spell»CL1: it, ok?
I`m   asking  you  all  about  nothing
special - just please »CL0:don`t change our
label»CL1:, ok?  This is only one proof but
if  you take a »CL0:deeper»CL1: look you`ll find
many  more buggy details inside.  What
does it mean at all?

»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:       Editors are ignorants?
»CL1:--------------------------------------

Yes,  you`re  »CL0:right»CL1:.  They are typical
ignorants  who don`t want to check the
actual     »CL0:statements»CL1:    of    groups,
»CL0:memberlists»CL1:  and other similiar stuff.
Come  on,  »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1: and others - don`t
make the »CL6:Eurochart»CL1: a scene »CL0:trashcan»CL1:; a
trashcan  filled with »CL0:mistakes»CL1: and »CL0:old»CL1:
»CL3:"news"»CL1:.   There are no remedy for this
-  just  please  take  a look at scene
packs  and  re-type  news  from  them.
Read  »CL6:"Frozen"»CL1:,  »CL6:"Save  Da  Vinyl"»CL1:  or
»CL6:"Scenet.de"»CL1:  to  be  »CL0:up-to-date»CL1:  about
scene  life.  Please study every »CL0:party
results»CL1: to learn how to spell and type
scene »CL0:handles»CL1: and group »CL0:names»CL1:.  If you
don`t  know  where  to  find all those
informations    take    a    look   at
»CL0:ftp.scene.org»CL1:  where  all  material is
being  stored.   If  you  guys want to
release  a  »CL0:fresh»CL1:  issue just ask some
people for sending you news files from
their  »CL0:own»CL1: and »CL0:friendly»CL1: groups.  I can
recommend   »CL2:Hakon»CL1:, »CL2: Kempy»CL1:,  »CL2:Lothar»CL1:  or
myself  for »CL0:polish»CL1: news and other guys
for »CL0: foreign»CL1:  news.  Is it hard to ask
for  »CL0:support»CL1:?   Otherwise  you`ll have
»CL3:"news"»CL1:  that's  half  a  year older(or
older), mainly collected and spread by
»CL2:Punisher»CL1:  -  the  master of old gossip
and  »CL3:"rotten"»CL1:  newsfiles.  When I read
the bullshit in »CL6:Eurochart #42»CL1: I wanted
to  cry »CL3:"Lamers!"»CL1: to the editors.  And
you  guys want to be recognized as the
»CL0:leading»CL1: scene charts and newsmagazine?
Don`t make people laugh, please...

»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:       Knowledge is basement
»CL1:--------------------------------------

Yep,  if you want to be an editor of a
»CL3:"leading"»CL1:  demoscene magazine you have
to  know what`s going on in the »CL0:normal»CL1:
scene life.  You, »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1: and others,
should  sometimes  quit  from  irc and
type  some »CL0:letters»CL1:.  It doesn't matter
how  - electronic, snail-mail or paper
-  just  for getting »CL0:support»CL1: and fresh
»CL0:information»CL1: about what, where, who and
why.  Of course I`ll hear »CL0:explanations»CL1:
like  "people  don`t  support  us with
news"  but  it`s  not an »CL0:excuse»CL1:!  From
the  beginning  you knew the rule - if
support doesn`t »CL0:come»CL1:, then »CL0:ask»CL1: for it.
Almost »CL0:everybody»CL1: are able to help you,
if  you  show them how to do it.  Back
to   knowledge  -  I  don`t  know  how
»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:  can  this:  "...i don`t know
what  »CL2:KNG»CL1:  or  »CL6:BUS»CL1:...".  The answer is
simple  -  it's »CL2:KeNGooroo»CL1:`s intro from
Assembly`99, called »CL6:"Bus"»CL1:.  »CL2:KNG»CL1: is the
arcronym  of  a  hungarian  group.   I
think  every swapper knows it.  Except
»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:  who  pisses other people off
by   showing  us  »CL0:mistakes »CL1: like  this
one...    Dear  editors  -  »CL0:talk»CL1:  with
people,  correct  the mistakes and put
some   more   »CL0:work»CL1:  into  new  issues,
please!   The  scene  and  the sceners
want   it!   If  you  are  making  the
»CL6:Eurochart»CL1:  please make it good or just
drop  it  »CL0:forever»CL1:.   Otherwise  people
will feel mistreated for sure!  Please
focus  on  »CL2:Madwizards»CL1:  releases  - the
only  shown release from the last half
a  year  by  »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:  was  »CL6:"SDV #27"»CL1:.
It`s   right   but   »CL2:Madwizards»CL1:   also
released  up  to  issue »CL0:30»CL1: of »CL6:"Save Da
Vinyl"»CL1:,  two new issues of »CL6:"Overview"»CL1:,
new  »CL6:"Excess  #7"»CL1:,  a video demo and a
bunch  of independent releases by each
member.  And this is only an example -
there  are  many  more  releases  from
scene  groups  that  »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:  doesn`t
know  about  - shame on you, »CL6:Eurochart»CL1:
editor, if you want to be respected...

»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:           Loonies rulez?
»CL1:--------------------------------------

"Seems  like  Polish people don't like
»CL2:Loonies»CL1:  too well, although that group
is  one  of  the  most  »CL0:successful»CL1: and
»CL0:winning »CL1: in  2000.  Can't imagine that
the  »CL0:Polish»CL1:  people  would be the ones
getting tired of boring 3d, so this is
a bit »CL0:weird»CL1:..."

Oh  please,  don`t  make  us »CL0:laugh»CL1: one
more   time.   To  be  honest  I  have
nothing  personal  against anyone from
»CL2:Loonies»CL1:  and  I  don`t  want  to  have
anything  against them in the future -
we  just  talk about Loonies releases.
They are a winning team?  Ok, they won
»CL6:Mekka  &  Symposium»CL1:  but  only because
there  were  no other quality entries.
»CL6:"Cybercinematastic"»CL1:   is  »CL0:not»CL1:  a  good
demo.   Simply.   Only,  this  one was
less  »CL0:shitty»CL1:  than  the other releases
and I hope the scene will forget about
it  very  soon.  »CL2:Loonies»CL1: (it`s only an
»CL0:example»CL1:)  released  some  other  small
productions    on    meetings   (small
parties)  in  »CL0:Denmark»CL1:  where they have
got  many friends and...  no »CL0:opponents»CL1:
so  they  always take one of the top 3
places.   And dear »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1: don`t tell
me it`s ok to treat them like »CL0:gods»CL1: and
vote  for  them  in  »CL0:every»CL1: issue.  The
only   respected  »CL2:Loonies»CL1:  release  is
»CL6:"Impossible"»CL1:  which deserves its place
on  several  charts.   I hope they are
still  learning  to code, how to model
scenes  and  (most  important)  how to
prepare   »CL0:texture»CL1:  and  »CL0:cliparts»CL1:.   In
these  times, where almost every coder
knows  how  to  code  all effects, the
most  important  thing  is the »CL0:design»CL1:.
Loonies are not shocking us, yet.  But
I pray for some really»CL0: quality»CL1: release
from them and other groups who "should
be   respected   by  polish  sceners".
Don`t kill me but I can tell you about
a  »CL0:dozen»CL1:  polish demos that are better
than  »CL2:Loonies»CL1: releases in every single
way.   But  we can not vote for polish
productions because it`s »CL0:immoral»CL1:..  So
poles  can only vote for old hits like
»CL6:"closer"»CL1:,   »CL6: "Killer"»CL1:, »CL6:  "Relic"»CL1:   and
others.   This  way  the charts become
oldtime-charts.   Do  you remember the
»CL6:"Scenetime"»CL1:'s action where productions
older  than  2-2,5 yeas were thrown to
the »CL3:"famous"»CL1: charts?  That`s the place
where »CL0:old»CL1: and »CL0:good »CL1:releases should be.
And »CL0:nowadays»CL1: charts should contain the
quality  releases  of  »CL0:today»CL1:.   If you
adopt this, you`ll see that 60% of the
respected stuff these days is released
in  »CL0:Poland»CL1: and it`s mirrored in »CL0:polish»CL1:
votes...

The  only  »CL0:curiosum»CL1:  is  the chart for
polish   based  editors  but  I  think
people  should  stop it after the »CL0:fuzz»CL1:
we  had  about it in polish magazines.
We   had   no  respectable  charts  of
»CL0:editors»CL1: here in Poland so people voted
for  polish  authors  in »CL0:international»CL1:
charts  in  »CL0:international»CL1:  mags.   I'd
like  to say I'm sorry for getting the
first  place  in  these  international
charts    while    not   being   known
»CL0:internationally»CL1: anymore...

And  where`s »CL2:Loonies»CL1: secret?  They are
just   better   »CL0:friends »CL1:  than   scene
»CL0:artists»CL1:.  They come to each party with
their  lamb  and  organise some»CL0: danish»CL1:
fun  (not  known  by  other  nations).
They  are »CL0: ok»CL1:,  so we have to »CL0:vote»CL1: for
them  and  »CL0:respect»CL1:  them?  If you care
about  »CL0:fun-delivering »CL1: teams  I  think
nothing  can  beat the polish »CL2:PSB»CL1: team
(Przyjaciele  Stefana B.) but they are
not   in  the  »CL0:charts»CL1:  because  polish
people  separate  »CL0:fun»CL1:  from »CL0:quality»CL1: in
their   votes.   And  that`s  the  sad
truth, which lots of you don`t want to
»CL0:accept»CL1: today...

PS.   Sorries, respects and handshakes
(in  a social way) goes to the»CL2: Loonies»CL1:
team - You were mentioned here just as
an   »CL0:example»CL1:   of   the  hipocrysy  of
»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1: and other western sceners...
