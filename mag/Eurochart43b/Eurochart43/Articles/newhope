»CL1:
Some   »CL0:sceners  »CL1: believed   that   the
»CL6:Mekka-Symposium»CL1:   party  this  eastern
would be a test if the amiga scene was
still »CL0: alive»CL1:  and  »CL0:kicking»CL1:.  And well,
they  got a clear answer:  »CL0:20»CL1: demos, »CL0:5»CL1:
64k  intros  and »CL0:4»CL1: 4k intros!  We have
to  go  as far as back to »CL6:The Party»CL1: in
»CL6:1995»CL1:  to  beat  that number of demos I
think!

I guess most sceners were »CL0:surprised»CL1: by
the  high  number of demos released at
this  party for sure.  Many people had
expected  »CL0:quite»CL1:  many  releases  as so
many  groups  »CL0:announced »CL1: they would be





presenting somehting  at  this   years
»CL6:Mekka-Symposium»CL1:  party as it had taken
over  as  the »CL0:number ONE»CL1:  scene-party.
But »CL0:20»CL1: demos? No, »CL0:none»CL1: predicted that!

It was rather »CL0:strange»CL1: that most of the
»CL3:"leading"»CL1:  Amiga  groups  presented  a
demo at this party and that the number
of  »CL0:demos»CL1:  was so much higher than the
number  of  »CL0:intros»CL1:.   I would also say
that  at  least »CL0: 5»CL1: of these demos were
quite  good, and none were really that
»CL0:bad»CL1: this year.

When it comes to the 64k »CL0:intros»CL1: I dare
to say that this competition got to be
one of the hardest ever despite so few
entries.   I think »CL0:all»CL1: the intros were
very   good.   As  for  the  »CL0:4k»CL1:  intro
competition,  it was not as good as we
could    have    expected   after   my
opinion...   but  the  winner was in a
class  of  its  own!   To  make  a  »CL0:4k
musicdisk»CL1:  as  »CL2:Ephidrena»CL1: did was quite
»CL0:cool»CL1:  too,  but  I  would rather see a
cool  4k »CL0:intro»CL1: from them.  And why not
release   a   bit  »CL0:bigger»CL1:  and»CL0:  better»CL1:
musicdisk  with  a better soundengine?
Some  »CL3:"instruments"»CL1:  were  missing  in
this 4k musicdisk.  Anyway, »CL0:cool idea»CL1:.

All  in all, the »CL6:Mekka-Symposium»CL1: party
got  to  have  been  a  great»CL0: success»CL1:!
Just  »CL0:think»CL1: about it, the scene hasn't
seen so many Amiga demos released at a
party  in nearly »CL0:6 years»CL1:!  In addition
to  that, at the same time a few other
productions   got   released   at  the
»CL6:Gathering»CL1: party.  The scene »CL0:passed the
test»CL1: with a great result, and new hope
arrived to our small but yet so active
scene!

We  have  many »CL0:active»CL1: demo »CL0:groups»CL1: with
both  old  and  new  sceners,  we have
still  »CL0:lots»CL1:  of »CL0: parties»CL1: to attend, we
have many packs and also a more active
»CL0:mag  scene»CL1:  than  in  many  years.  We
occasionally   also   get   some   new
»CL0:musicdisks»CL1:  and »CL0: slideshows»CL1:,  so  what
more  can we wish?  The future for the
Amiga  scene looks quite »CL0:bright»CL1:...  so
lets hope that also the future for »CL0:new»CL1:
Amiga »CL0:hardware»CL1: and »CL0:software»CL1: is just as
bright!
