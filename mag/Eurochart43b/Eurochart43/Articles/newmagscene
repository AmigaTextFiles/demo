»CL1:
This  article  was  originally written
for »CL6:Devotion 2»CL1: back in early February.
But  due  to  the  »CL0:incompetence»CL1:  of  a
certain  »CL0:editor»CL1:,  I  choose to publish
the  article  slightly modified in the
»CL6:EuroChart 43»CL1: instead.

--------------------------------------

After  a  few »CL0:depressing»CL1: years when it
comes  to  the mag scene, with one mag
after  another  fading away, this year
has started quite optimistic.

In  late  January  a  big issue of the





»CL0:very»CL1:  delayed  digital  mag, »CL6: D.I.S.C.»CL1:
got released.  And 3 weeks afterwards,
another  issue  of  the  »CL6:EuroChart»CL1: got
out.  It was also a big issue for this
chartmag, with more »CL0:votes»CL1: and »CL0:articles»CL1:
than  usual.   And  also  »CL6:ShowTime»CL1: has
been  released  with a very »CL0:big»CL1: issue.
And  now  you're  reading  yet another
issue  of  the »CL6: EuroChart»CL1: with lots of
votes  and articles.  And soon another
issue  of »CL6: ShowTime »CL1: should  hopefully
come  also,  in  addition  to  another
issue  of »CL6:D.I.S.C.»CL1:  in August.  And we
must  not  forget  that »CL6:Taboo»CL1: also got
released in January, »CL6:Excess»CL1: in May and
probably more mag releases from »CL0:Poland»CL1:
will  come  soon.   Already  now,  the
scene has gotten about the same amount
of releases as the entire last »CL0:year»CL1:.

In  addition to this, an initiative by
»CL2:Coach»CL1:  of  »CL2:The  Twilight Team»CL1: has been
launched.   He  will  create a new mag
based  on the »CL6:Strefa Mroku»CL1: code.  This
new  mag  will  have  the  best polish
articles  translated into »CL0:english»CL1:, and
the  best articles written in english,
translated  into »CL0:Polish»CL1:!  So watch out
for it.

But  this  is not all! »CL0:Another»CL1: new mag
will  hit  the  scene in the »CL0:autumn»CL1: or
earlier.   I'm  not  allowed to reveal
more  about  it,  so  you just have to
wait for it.
And then there are always something we
never  expect...  new »CL0:unannounced»CL1: mags
that   suddenly   get  released.   And
perhaps  some  older  mags  will  make
another  »CL3:"comeback" »CL1: also,  like »CL6:Oepir
Risti»CL1: and »CL6:TrashCan»CL1: for example.

The scene also got quite many of these
»CL0:packmags»CL1:.   I at least have to mention
the packmags »CL6:Sabotage»CL1:,»CL6: Frozen Pack»CL1: and
»CL6:Speed»CL1:.

So  to  all  of those who say that the
mag  scene is dead, think again!  It's
more  »CL0:alive»CL1:  than it has been the last
two  years  for  sure.   And hopefully
this  trend will continue.  We now see
the  contours of a new mag scene, with
not  only  chartsmags as the »CL6:EuroChart»CL1:
and  »CL6:ShowTime»CL1:  like  the recent years,
but  also  more  ordinary  mags,  like
»CL6:D.I.S.C.»CL1:    Anyway,  »CL6:EC »CL1: and »CL6: ST»CL1:  have
»CL0:evolved »CL1: a lot during  this period and
are  now  almost like the »CL0:normal»CL1: mags.
We  have seen some new writer talents,
but  also  some  of  the  old  editors
continues to contribute.
                                                       »PIC:darklight-ec1.iff»
Hopefully  the  editors of the present
mags  will continue and a few »CL0:new»CL1: ones
will  appear,  then I'm sure the scene
will  experience a lot of great issues
the next years.
