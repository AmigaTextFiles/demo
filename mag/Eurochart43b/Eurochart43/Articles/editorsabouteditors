»CL1:
Are  you  an  »CL0:editor»CL1:?   Probably.   If
you're even »CL0:bothering»CL1: to read diskmags
anymore,  then  you must be.  Why else
would  one  put  up  with article upon
article  whose  only  real  »CL0:content»CL1: is
»CL0:criticism»CL1:  of  other »CL0: articles»CL1:  or the
»CL0:people»CL1:  who  wrote  them.  When I page
through  a »CL0:diskmag»CL1:, I'm always annoyed
to  see  how many of the articles deal
with   »CL0:nothing»CL1:   but   »CL0:diskmag»CL1:-related
topics.

Ideally,  editors occupy  an important
»CL0:niche»CL1:,  their  »CL0:responsibility»CL1: being to
let  each  »CL0:scener»CL1: know what's going in





the »CL0: rest»CL1:  of  the  scene and to offer
»CL0:comments»CL1:,   »CL0:thoughts»CL1:   and   differing
»CL0:perspectives»CL1:  on  what  goes on in our
tiny   little  world.   But  when  all
editors  seem  to  be interested in is
»CL0:one  another»CL1:, they effectively »CL0:isolate»CL1:
themselves  from  the  scene,  thereby
cutting  themselves off from the »CL0:input»CL1:
that's  so »CL0:vital»CL1: to their writing.  As
such  a  »CL0:closed»CL1: community, they simply
cannot  write »CL0: anything»CL1:.   What  stuff
they do write is limited to »CL0:rethorical»CL1:
discussions  on which editor said what
and  perhaps why (and you »CL0:know»CL1: he said
it   because   »CL0:another »CL1:  editor   said
something  »CL0:else»CL1:, doing that to comment
on  a  »CL0:third»CL1: editor who said something
»CL0:else»CL1: long ago, and so on).

By   continually   writing  about  the
»CL0:diskmag»CL1:   scene,   the  diskmag  scene
demonstrates   very   well  that  it's
»CL0:seperating»CL1: itself from the »CL0:demo»CL1: scene.
If  the  topic  of  an  article  isn't
strictly  this  and that »CL0:editor»CL1:, it'll
often   be   strictly  »CL0:diskmag»CL1:-related
anyway;   Discussions  about who »CL0:votes»CL1:
for  what, about whether or not »CL0:charts»CL1:
are  important, about why this »CL0:diskmag»CL1:
is   better   than  that  »CL0:diskmag»CL1:,  or
something  equally  »CL0:unimportant»CL1: to the
»CL0:demo»CL1: scene.

I  guess in part this is the result of
»CL0:laziness»CL1:.   When  editors try to write
something »CL0:scene»CL1:-related, it more often
than not ends up in useless statements
of »CL0: opinion»CL1: - because writing anything
else    requires   both  »CL0: inspiration»CL1:,
»CL0:research»CL1: and careful »CL0:consideration»CL1:.

»CL0:Inspiration»CL1:  may  be  hard to find, of
course.  But there's a whole »CL0:scene»CL1: out
there that happily »CL0:invites»CL1: you to keep
your  eyes  »CL0:open»CL1:  and  take  a look at
what's   going  on.   Once  you  truly
»CL0:experience»CL1:  the  scene, you won't have
to  »CL0:look»CL1: for inspiration, it'll simply
»CL0:come»CL1:  to you.  When an editor comments
on another article rather than writing
a  »CL0:new»CL1:  one  on  a  »CL0:new»CL1:  subject, that
suggests he's »CL0:uninspired»CL1:.

»CL0:Research»CL1:  OTOH  doesn't  just  »CL0:come»CL1: to
you.   It  requires  true  »CL0:devotion»CL1: to
spend more than a minute or two on »CL0:one»CL1:
article.   The  idea  of  making »CL0:phone
calls»CL1:,    searching    through   »CL0:scene
archives»CL1:,  emailing  no  longer active
sceners,  etc., somehow »CL0:repels»CL1: most if
not  »CL0:all»CL1:  editors.   So  far I haven't
read  a  more  than »CL0:one»CL1: or »CL0:two»CL1: diskmag
articles  that  made me think "wow, he
really  must've  put  a  lot of »CL0:effort»CL1:
into that".

By  »CL0:careful  »CL0:consideration»CL1: I'm talking
about  the  way most editors just seem
to  »CL0:blurt»CL1: out whatever their thinking,
not  »CL0:caring»CL1:  if  they  wander off into
some discussion that doesn't »CL0:relate»CL1: to
the »CL0:topic»CL1: they've chosen.  That is, if
they've  even  »CL0:chosen»CL1:  one.  I've seen
»CL0:countless»CL1: articles that appear to have
been started »CL0:before»CL1: the editor had any
clue  what  the »CL0:topic»CL1: was going to be.
You  have to »CL0:choose»CL1: a topic, »CL0:know»CL1: what
you're  going  to  write, »CL0:confirm»CL1: that
this  is  indeed  »CL0:interesting»CL1:  to  the
reader,  consider  how you're going to
»CL0:shape»CL1:  the  article, review the »CL0:points»CL1:
you  want  to  make,  and  »CL0:THEN»CL1:  start
writing.   Then  »CL0:while»CL1: you're writing,
always  ask  yourself if this is going
to somehow »CL0:enrich»CL1: whoever reads it, or
if   it'll  just  serve  to  extend  a
tedious     »CL0:download»CL1:    by    a    few
microseconds.

If   you   want  the  opinion  of  one
»CL0:frustrated»CL1:   reader,   these  are  the
things  we  don't  see  enough  of  in
diskmags:

- »CL0:Gossip»CL1:.  Yes, gossip is interesting.
It portrays the scene as being full of
»CL0:life»CL1:.  It shows the »CL0:struggle»CL1: going on,
the »CL0:hostilities»CL1: and »CL0:frindships»CL1: between
groups  and  individuals.  »CL6:Devotion #2»CL1:
had a bit of this and I really enjoyed
reading  it,  even  though  most of it
didn't  have  anything  to  do with »CL0:me»CL1:
directly.   Simply  put,  it  was  »CL0:fun
reading»CL1:.

-  »CL0:Investigative  interviews»CL1:.  All the
interviews   I've   read   in   recent
diskmags  have been a kind of standard
»CL3:"fill-out-this-form"»CL1: ones.  Never does
an    »CL0:interviewer »CL1:   use   this   rare
»CL0:opportunity»CL1: to dig into a matter which
»CL0:interests»CL1:  people.   An interview with
»CL2:Antibyte»CL1:  might be strictly an attempt
to find out why he's no longer active.
An  interview  with  some »CL0:Polish»CL1: coder
could  be strictly a discussion of the
»CL0:Europe-Poland»CL1: situation.  Forget those
»CL3:"how  long have you been active in the
scene"»CL1:  questions,  cause  the readers
»CL0:don't  care»CL1:.   If  you want to write a
biography,  then  »CL0:write  a  biography»CL1:.
You may »CL0:combine»CL1: that with an interview
to   make   the  article  appear  more
»CL0:serious»CL1:,  but don't think an interview
»CL0:full»CL1:  of  questions  like »CL3:"how old are
you"»CL1: is going to be taken seriously by
»CL0:anyone»CL1:.

- »CL0: Investigative  reporting»CL1:.   This is
the  kind of article that looks into a
particular  »CL0:event»CL1:,  »CL0:scener»CL1:  or  »CL0:group»CL1:.
»CL0:Partyreports»CL1:   (the   only   kind   of
reporting  we  »CL0:see»CL1: in diskmags) do not
fall under that category, because they
don't look »CL0:into»CL1: anything.  They merely
»CL0:scrape»CL1:     the   »CL0:  surface»CL1:,    telling
non-attenders   what   the   »CL0:attenders»CL1:
experienced.   One very obvious »CL0:target»CL1:
for  investigative  reporting  are the
»CL0:organizers»CL1:  of »CL6: The  Party»CL1:.  Why don't
they »CL0:follow through»CL1: on their »CL0:promises»CL1:,
why  do they continue to »CL0:prioritize PC
sceners»CL1:,   »CL0:non-platform»CL1:   sceners  and
»CL0:gamers»CL1:,  all  the  while »CL0:boasting»CL1: that
they're   taking   you  »CL3:"back  to  the
roots"»CL1:, and so on.  If an editor could
»CL0:answer»CL1:  those  questions  and do it on
the   basis  of  »CL1:hard »CL0: facts»CL1:  that  he
uncovered  through  vigorous  »CL0:research»CL1:
and  »CL0:investigation»CL1:,  he  would be in a
position  to  write  what might be the
»CL0:best»CL1: article to date.  But then again,
I  reckon  not  »CL0:one»CL1:  editor would »CL0:care»CL1:
enough  about  his  craft  to put that
much  »CL0:work »CL1:into just »CL0:one»CL1: article, when
he  might  as  well write »CL0:ten»CL1: articles
about  »CL0:diskmags»CL1:.   It's  not  like the
competition  is  »CL0:fierce»CL1:,  I can safely
say,  having  read some of the »CL0:crap»CL1: in
this issue of the »CL6:Eurochart»CL1:.

Research  is one of the most »CL0:important»CL1:
things  in  »CL0:writing»CL1:.   If  you »CL0:know»CL1: an
article  is  based  on  the results of
vigorous  »CL0:research»CL1:, then you »CL0:know»CL1: that
article  reflects something beyond the
»CL0:opinion»CL1: of the editor.  To »CL0:demonstrate»CL1:
this  weird concept, I've been looking
through  a  lot  of old »CL0:diskmags»CL1: on my
»CL0:floppy»CL1: collection.  I thought it would
be  interesting  to  »CL0:compare»CL1: mags from
the   early   90s   with   present-day
diskmags.  I was »CL0:right»CL1:.  In fact there
are so many interesting »CL0:comparisons»CL1: to
make  and  »CL0:parallels»CL1:  to  draw that it
calls  for  an  article all to itself.
But  then,  that would be just »CL0:another»CL1:
article  about  »CL0:diskmags»CL1:, and I really
hope  this'll  be my »CL0:first»CL1: and »CL0:last»CL1: of
the sort.
