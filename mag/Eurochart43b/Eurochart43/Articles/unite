This  article  is going to be an offer
for  you  or  your  organizer  in your
group.   I  have  been  thinking about
this  for  a  while and I came to this
conclusion?

»CL9:Eurochart needs a mailinglist!

»CL1:A mailing for »CL0:organizers»CL1: or people who
just  want  to  spread  some»CL0:  news»CL1: for
their own group.  This would make sure
that your group always had the lastest
news  in  »CL6:Eurochart»CL1:.  This mailinglist







can  also  be  used  for other usefull
purposes.   Such  as,  »CL0:advertisements»CL1:,
productionlists  and  a way to get the
lastest  »CL0:news»CL1:,  which  can  be»CL0: updated»CL1:
quickly.

A  mailinglist would make it more easy
for  me  or  who else ever is going to
make  this  work  for »CL6:Eurochart»CL1: in the
future.   And  I/he  could  spend more
time  on  other  things,  than collect
these  news  and adverts via »CL0:swapping»CL1:,
»CL0:e-mails»CL1: and »CL0:IRC»CL1:.  And concentrate more
on  regular  articles  than  the  time
robbing    news   and   advertisements
collecting.

This  mailinglist  can also be used to
spread  »CL0:news»CL1: from your group.  In case
»CL6:Eurochart»CL1:  will not be released in the
nearest  future,  but  that is only an
idea  I  have on my mind, nothing that
will be »CL0:realized»CL1: yet.

The  first  step  will  be  like this.
Create   a  mailinglist  where  »CL0:e-mail»CL1:
»CL0:addresses»CL1:  from  as many organizers as
is possible is registered.  And I will
mail  them some weeks before »CL6:Eurochart»CL1:
will  be released and then I will wait
for  feedback  from you organizers and
add  the news and advertisment for the
next issue of »CL6:Eurochart»CL1:.
So    the   only   thing   that   this
mailinglist  will make sure of is that
we  have  the  latest  news  from your
crew.

So  if  you  think  that this might be
something  for »CL0: you»CL1: in case you are an
»CL0:organizer »CL1: or  if  you just think that
your   organizer  should  be  on  this
mailinglist,  then send a mail to this
address.

            »CL5:Adonis@gmx.li

»CL1:And  I will answer as fast as possible
and tell you if you have been added to
the  new  mailing  of the scene, which
should  make  sure  that  the news and
advertisements  in »CL6:Eurochart»CL1: have been
raised to another level.
