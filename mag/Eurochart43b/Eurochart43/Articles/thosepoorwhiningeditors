»CL5:                                 by Darkhawk/IRIS

»CL1:I'll  name  them  straight away.  When
»CL2:Fishwave »CL1: did  his  last editorial for
»CL6:Seenpoint #10»CL1: I thought he was »CL0:whining»CL1:
and  trying  to  make some »CL0:excuses»CL1: for
himself,  by saying that the scene was
so  focused  on »CL0:upgrading»CL1:, and that he
couldn't  view the »CL0:scenish»CL1: productions
anymore.  In actuality I think he lost
»CL0:interest»CL1: in the scene, but didn't want
to  say it.  And now »CL2:Sane»CL1:, in »CL6:Devotion
#2»CL1:,  using  one  of  my  articles as a
starting  point  for  saying  that the
reason  »CL0:diskmags»CL1:  became  less »CL0:factual»CL1:
and  »CL0:engaged»CL1:  in the scene, is because
»CL0:editors»CL1:  can't  or  won't keep up with





the  upgrade  »CL0:'rush'»CL1:,  and  thus  they
can't   get   a   »CL0:feel»CL1:   for  the  new
productions.    What  utter,  whining,
»CL0:nonsense»CL1:!

I  was  »CL0:irritated »CL1: at this in the last
»CL6:Seenpoint»CL1:,  but  now I guess it merits
an article all of its own.  »CL2:Sane»CL1: seems
to  think  that  there  are  a  lot of
»CL0:editors»CL1: who might have been »CL0:locked»CL1: out
of the scene, not through any fault of
their  own, but for the fact that they
do  not own the »CL0:hardware»CL1: needed today.
Whether  this  is  their fault, or the
fault  of the »CL0:scene»CL1: (for not utilizing
the  capabilities  of  the  lower spec
Amiga's), »CL2:Sane »CL1:is so »CL0:magnamonius»CL1: as to
be  left  unsaid.   There are at least
two  things  wrong  with  taking  this
view,  that  editors  are »CL0:stuggling »CL1:to
keep   up   with  scenish  happenings,
because of too old »CL0:hardware»CL1:.

First   off,   the   »CL0:hypocrisy  »CL1:of  it
astounds me.  Instead of saying things
straight,  like  I  saw  »CL2:Fishwave »CL0: NOT»CL1:
doing  in  the  »CL6:SP#10»CL1:, »CL2:Sane»CL1: blames the
»CL0:upgrade  rush»CL1:  for  his  lack of being
part of the present scenish »CL0:happenings»CL1:
(chiding  diskmags  nowadays  for  not
running   purely   on  »CL0:2mb  chip»CL1:,  and
praising  »CL0:old»CL1:  diskmags for being able
to do so.  Well, try to quit »CL0:UAE»CL1: »CL2:Sane»CL1:,
and  load  up  the  »CL6:EC»CL1:  on  your plain
»CL0:A1200»CL1:,  just to get facts straight..),
he  doesn't  say  here, that the »CL0:scene»CL1:
has lost interest for »CL0:him»CL1: (although he
does that elsewhere, to be fair).  Why
is   this  »CL0:hypocritical»CL1:?   First  off,
upgrade »CL0:'rush'»CL1:?  My »CL0:A1200»CL1: and my »CL0:A4000»CL1:
are  the  newest  Amiga's I have, both
have been produced in»CL0: 1993»CL1:.  In 1993 I
got  a  »CL0:030'»CL1:, in 1996 a »CL0:040»CL1:, in 1997 a
»CL0:060'»CL1:,  since  that I have not upgraded
my  Amiga  in  any  relevant  sceneway
except  for  the addition of »CL0:RAM»CL1: I got
for  »CL0:free»CL1:  along the way.  Wow, what a
thoroughly  »CL0:mad»CL1:  and »CL0:expensive»CL1: upgrade
rush,  it really leaves me winded when
I  think of it...  It wasn't »CL0:expensive»CL1:
either,  I  guess  I  spent »CL0:300$»CL1: on my
complete  A4060  system, secondhand in
1997.  Oh, you think this is expensive
and  a good argument against following
the  scene  in  this?  You might think
so,  but  spare  us  all the»CL0: hypocrisy»CL1:
following  it, when you have your »CL0:800$»CL1:
PC   system,  which  you  upgrade  for
around  »CL0:200-400$»CL1:  a  »CL0:year»CL1:.   Truth is,
it's  »CL0:not»CL1:  expensive  having an Amiga,
that  can  view  all  of  the  scenish
productions  (even  »CL0:PPC»CL1:  is  not  that
expensive,  secondhand, but let's just
pretend  PPC  doesn't  exist, since it
doesn't  seem  to  have much »CL0:impact»CL1: on
the  scene),  we  all have some »CL0:job»CL1: or
means  of  getting  »CL0:money»CL1:,  and we all
have  priorities meaning we spend much
more  money  than  an  ok Amiga system
would  cost,  on  other  »CL0:pleasures»CL1: and
»CL0:hobbies»CL1:.   Saying  one  »CL0:has»CL1: to upgrade
madly  to  follow  the Amiga scene, or
that  it  is  to  expensive,  is plain
»CL0:hypocrisy»CL1:.  Why not just be »CL0:honest»CL1: and
say  you  don't  consider  the present
scene  worth  the »CL0:200-300$»CL1:, instead of
inventing  »CL0:hollowsounding»CL1:  excuses  to
»CL0:cover»CL1:  this fact?  You might think the
scene  is not »CL0:worth it»CL1: anymore, and go
sit  infront  of  your quite expensive
»CL0:PC»CL1:,  fiddling  with  »CL0:UAE»CL1: occasionally,
that's »CL0:ok»CL1:, but don't tell anybody that
the hardware upgrading is to blame for
this.  Your arguments about this would
carry   more  weight  if  we  were  »CL0:PC»CL1:
sceners,   as   it   really  would  be
expensive  to  upgrade and it would be
more  of  a  »CL0:rush»CL1:,  but  also  in that
situation,  what  it  comes down to is
how  »CL0:motivated»CL1: you are in being a part
of  the  »CL0:present»CL1:  scene,  and  the sad
truth  seem to be that you are not all
that motivated, when you can find such
»CL0:minor   details»CL1:   as   the   price  of
upgrading  to complain about.  Why not
simply  »CL0:admit»CL1: that you editors have no
more  scenish  »CL0:motivation»CL1:,  instead of
saying  that diskmags »CL0:die »CL1:or »CL0:get worse»CL1:
as  editors leave, because editors are
stuggling  to  keep  up with the 'new'
Amiga hardware, since they only needed
a  plain  »CL0:A1200»CL1:  for writing articles?
That reason must »CL0:cling hollow»CL1: for most
sceners,  even  without  my text about
this..  Yes, this was for »CL2:Fishwave»CL1: and
»CL2:Sane»CL1:,  the  two  editors  I  have seen
»CL0:directly»CL1: writing about this yet. »CL2: Sane»CL1:
even   talks   about  the  »CL0:barrier  of
technology»CL1:.    Get   »CL0:real»CL1:  man!   What
»CL0:barrier»CL1: is there?  Since the »CL0:PPC»CL1: is no
real  »CL0:acclaimed  »CL1:part  of  the  scene,
although  it's  been around for years,
the  upper  spec machine for the Amiga
scene  is  a »CL0:060»CL1: with around »CL0:32 mb RAM»CL1:
(ok,  20mb  is enough, but you can get
that  old  RAM for »CL0:free»CL1:, practically),
and  then  a »CL0:HD»CL1: and a »CL0:monitor/TV»CL1:.  You
don't  even  need a »CL0:graphiccard»CL1:.  What
formidable   BARRIER   of   technology
indeed..  And yes, conveniently try to
»CL0:blot»CL1: out your »CL0:PC standing»CL1: there, being
a  bit  more  costly and upgraded than
that..

Just   to   forestall   »CL0:some»CL1:  articles
against this at least, let me tell you
how you can »CL0:legitimize»CL1: your view a bit
more, and make it stronger.  I already
said  you  could  just state the facts
»CL0:plainly»CL1:, admitting that you don't »CL0:feel»CL1:
as  much  about  the scene as you once
did,  and  that that's the »CL0:real»CL1: reason
you  don't  want  to upgrade.  You can
also  say  that you want to get people
to   »CL0:down-grade»CL1:   their   Amiga's  and
produce  stuff  like  in the »CL0:old»CL1: days,
»CL0:quality»CL1:  stuff on »CL0:1»CL1: or »CL0:2 disks»CL1:, filled
with   »CL0:good  code»CL1:,  »CL0:stunning  gfx»CL1:  and
»CL0:unique   4chn   modules»CL1:,   in   short,
productions   showing  »CL0:simple»CL1:  quality
over mb's of scanned, mp3'ed 3D engine
»CL0:CRAP»CL1:!   Ehrr.   That  is  what I would
like  to  see,  a  downgrading  of the
scene  in hardware specs, and focusing
more on the »CL0:older»CL1: ways of doing demos,
but  you  won't  hear  me  complaining
about  having  to  »CL0:upgrade »CL1: to  a 060,
etc.,  I  did  it because I»CL0: wanted»CL1: to,
and  I  was »CL0:happy»CL1: when I did, I didn't
feel  like it was something that I »CL0:had»CL1:
to do to keep up, and that's because I
am  »CL0:motivated»CL1:  for this, both the »CL0:past»CL1:
and  the  »CL0:present»CL1:  of the scene.  If I
lost all motivation, I would not blame
the »CL0: PPC»CL1: Amiga's, or say the scene had
died,  while  in actuality it was »CL0:wide
alive»CL1:,  only  different  from  what  I
»CL0:preferred»CL1:.   So,  let's get this whole
»CL3:'Diskmags  are  not  as  good  anymore
because  editors are less engaged, and
they  are  less  engaged  because they
can't see the newer productions'»CL1: topic
buried  once  and  for  all.   »CL0:Editors»CL1:
holding   to  this  view  should  quit
whining  and  »CL0:upgrade»CL1:, or quit whining
and »CL0: quit  the  scene»CL1:.   Make  up your
minds  as  to whether you want to be a
part  of  the »CL0:scene»CL1: or »CL0:not»CL1:, and if you
want  to,  regardless  of reason, »CL0:200$»CL1:
will be a small enough price to pay.
