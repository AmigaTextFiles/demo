        »SML:»CL7:   -------------------

»CL1:The »CLA:Eurochart »CL1:is a somewhat huge 
piece of freelancing work, »CL4:assembled 
»CL1:by a »CL4:few people»CL1:, who do almost 
nothing for 4 months, and then »CL4:work 
»CL1:very »CL4:hard »CL1:for around a week. These 
people also do it for free of course.
 And so it happens, from time to 
time, that some mistake slips by us, 
that we write some things which might 
not be accurate, we mention something 
wrong, or we »CL5:neglect to credit people»CL1: 
for their work. Oh yes, and 
especially the last thing we get a 
lot of feedback from. It's »CL4:not»CL1: that 
we do these errors just because we're
»CL4:desperate»CL1: for any kind of feedback, 
no no, that would not be like us, 
at all! 

Ehrr, anyway, »CL4:we are human»CL1:, so we have
made some mistakes now and then, and
last time, we actually did quite a
number of not so nice mistakes, in our
mad rush to finish off the EC. This
article is a way of saying "»CLB:we're
sorry»CL1:", and rectifying our mistakes.
So, thats what we will do, starting
now.

SORRY »CL3:Kada»CL1:, for not crediting you for
some of the nice »CL4:cliparts»CL1: you did for
us, and which we did publish, in the
»CL4:Eurochart 42»CL1:. We're very sorry at
this, and we hope you haven't been too
fed up with us. Actually we managed to
somehow loose your vote too, so we're
doubly sorry. Hope this »CL4:apology»CL1: and
our use of your cliparts for this time
(if I »CL4:forget»CL1: to »CL4:credit »CL1:this in the
credits section, I might aswell apply
for a place in a retirement home for
senile people) makes up for it!

»CL3:Scicco »CL1:of »CL3:Scarab»CL1:.. Yes, Sorry to you
too, for »CL4:not crediting»CL1: you for that
»CL4:party report»CL1: you had in the last
issue. With the LOOW amount of 
support we get, you'd think we would
be able to credit those people
actually doing something for us, but
apparently we failed in this
department last time. »CL4:Sorry Scicco»CL1:,
but don't be afraid, keep the articles
coming, maybe next time we'll decide
to credit you! 

»CL3:Zito »CL1:of »CL3:Darkage»CL1:.. Sorry man, you wrote 
some »CL4:swapper recommendations »CL1:for our 
»CLB:Reliable Swapper chart»CL1:, but instead of 
crediting you, I cited some of your 
comments, and credited 
Angeldust/Apathy for them instead. 
Yes, I bow my head in shame, and »CL4:beg 
»CL1:for an »CL4:apology»CL1:. 

And, this concludes it for this time I 
think. We messed up here and there 
last time, but I still hope you 
thought it was a »CLD:nice issue»CL1:. And 
theres probably more I forgot to 
mention, about our EC42 mistakes, but 
I guess I have forgotten the rest, 
ehrr...
