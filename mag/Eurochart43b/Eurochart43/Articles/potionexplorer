»CL1:
                 (Feel the power of the new sceners generation)

The  »CL2:Potion»CL1:  group  is a unique one on
the   Polish   computer  scene.   Why?
Well,  it is so because it is the only
group  which proved to be succesful at
the  »CL0:Western»CL1: parties.  This succes is,
of  course,  »CL6:"Gift" »CL1: - the intro compo
winner  at  »CL6:Mekka/Symposium'2000»CL1:.   It
seems   improbable   especially   when
taking  into consideration that »CL2:Potion»CL1:
was  formed  recently  (the  group has
only  existed  for  a little more than
two  years!).  So far, it has released
many   classic   productions,   gained







several  top  rankings  and  is  often
placed  at the top of the »CL0:charts»CL1:.  How
is it that»CL2: Potion »CL1:arrived on the scene
and  how  did  it  achieve its current
»CL0:position»CL1:?   The  person  to tell about
this  is »CL2:Mavey»CL1: - an unquestioned group
leader,   »CL2:Potions  »CL1:organizer  and  the
creator     of    »CL2: Potions»CL1:    greatest
productions!

[...]  The  »CL2:Potion »CL1:group was formed at
the »CL6:'Quast'»CL1: party, (7-9.  August 1998)
It  is  a  result  of  the  fusion  of
»CL2:Victims»CL1:  (set  up  by  a  few guy from
»CL0:Bydgoszcz»CL1::   »CL2:Sator»CL1:, »CL2:Mavey»CL1:, »CL2:Pretorian»CL1:),
and   »CL2:RedBullz»CL1:  (the  »CL0:Inowroclaw»CL1:  team
mainly:  »CL2:Idaho»CL1:, »CL2:Lothar»CL1:,»CL2: Hris»CL1:).  [...]

»CL2:Mavey »CL1: himself  was once nicknamed »CL2:Tim»CL1:
and   coded  two  intros  for »CL2: Victim»CL1::
»CL6:"Dysentery  1  and 2"»CL1:.  However, these
productions    never    received   any
particular  »CL0:recognition»CL1:.   At the very
same  »CL6:'Quast'»CL1:  party one could already
feel  what was going to happen and see
the  prospects of a »CL2:Mavey »CL1:+ »CL2:Skip»CL1: team!
The  first  production  (not using the
»CL2:Potion »CL1: name, though) was »CL6:"Spleen"»CL1:, an
intro with several interesting effects
(nice  »CL3:'bump  mapping'»CL1:!)  and with goa
music  by  Skip.  The first production
under  the  name  of  »CL2:Potion »CL1: was  the
»CL6:"Outgroving" »CL1:   intro,   released   at
»CL6:Gravity'98 »CL1: and  this  intro  won  the
first   prize.    However,   the  real
»CL3:"invasion" »CL1:  took  place  as  late  as
during »CL6:Astrosyn'99»CL1: where 2 demos and 2
intros   really   showed   the   great
potential  within  »CL2:Potion»CL1:!   The  demo
»CL6:"Mansion  of  Illusion" »CL1: coded by Math
won  the  fourth place and »CL6:"Vertus"»CL1: (a
leading  demo  done by »CL2:Mavey»CL1: with fine
3D   Scenes   (»CL2:Konus»CL1:,  »CL2: Mavey»CL1:),   nice
graphics  (»CL2:Nelson»CL1:, »CL2:Caro»CL1:), and hypnotic
music  by »CL2: Tzx»CL1:)  finished in the first
place.   In  the  intro  compo, »CL6:"Gush"»CL1:
(with  its excellent code by»CL2: Mavey »CL1:and
impressive  music  by »CL2:Skip»CL1:) was beyond
any  competition and »CL6:"Myth"»CL1: was placed
second  in the 4k intro-compo.  It was
a  first class debut!  And how was the
first   success  »CL0:received»CL1:?   Did  they
exspect it?

[...] »CL2:Mavey»CL1::  I knew it would be quite
something.   People  might not believe
this,  but »CL6:"Vertus"»CL1: was my first demo!
Before, there was "»CL6:Greamleaven"»CL1: but it
had  been  made  to  be presented at a
party  so  it  is  not quite the same.
[...]

The above mentioned »CL6:"Vertus"»CL1: has for a
long  time  been  considered  the best
Polish  demo and this could be seen in
the  »CL0:charts »CL1: - both Polish and Western
charts.   And I think that the fact it
was  still present in the recent issue
of  »CL6:"Eurochart"  (#41)»CL1:  proves that it
isn't losing»CL0: popularity»CL1:.  And how does
the  main  part  author look upon this
demo now?

[...]  »CL2:Mavey»CL1:: »CL6: "Vertus"»CL1: is old...  and
everybody  knows there has been better
productions   recently,  for  example,
»CL6:"Datablade" »CL1: by  »CL2:Floppy»CL1: (»CL2:Zig»CL1: is really
good  with 15 bits AGA!).  I also like
»CL2:Kierownik's»CL1:    demos   from   »CL6:Assembly»CL1:
(»CL6:"Metatag"»CL1:)  and »CL6:Satellite»CL1: ("»CL6:I want to
be   machine»CL1:").   There   may  be some
names  which  slipped  my  mind, but I
must  admit  there  has  been  several
interesting products.  [...]

After »CL6: Astrosyn»CL1: came the time for»CL6: Rush
Hours'99»CL1: and the productions of »CL2:Potion»CL1:
were  not  actually »CL0:smash hits»CL1: at that
party,  although »CL2: Potion»CL1: shoved itself
as    a    very    productive    team.
»CL6:"Neogenetic"»CL1:  -  »CL2:Math's»CL1: last job under
the  name  of  »CL2:Potion»CL1: was placed third
and  »CL6:"Exodus"»CL1:  - with perfect code and
exact  3D  Scenes,  graphics by »CL2:Nelson»CL1:
and  music by»CL2: Skip»CL2: - only »CL0:second»CL1:.  For
the  very  active »CL2: Potion»CL1:, the year of
1999   brought  yet  another  party  -
»CL6:Xenium'99»CL1:  and a second place with the
intro  »CL6:"Raos"»CL1:.   Then  came  the  huge
success at »CL6:Mekka/Symposium!»CL1:  The duo -
»CL2:Mavey»CL1:  + »CL2: Skip»CL1:  - blew all competitors
away  with  their amazing »CL6:"Gift"»CL1: which
had no equal in »CL0:Fallingbostel»CL1:!

[...]  »CL2:Mavey:»CL1:   As  for »CL6: "Gift"»CL1: that's
another story...  Well, as you know it
was  made by »CL2:Skip»CL1: and me...  it took a
lot   of  time  but  I  think  it  was
worthwhile  :)  The fact that we could
meet often and work on details to make
the  final effects as good as possible
was  also  a great advantage.  Besides
Skip  and I understand each other very
well  and it is thanks to this that we
were  able to make not only »CL6:"Gift"»CL1: but
also  »CL6:"Spleen" »CL1: and »CL6: "Gush"»CL1: :) You can
say we are (I mean »CL2:Skip»CL1: and I) sort of
»CL3:'duo'»CL1: ;) [...]

Well,  this  raises  another question:
Somehow  it  is  »CL2:Potions »CL1:intros rather
than  the  demos  which  seem  to have
received   more   »CL0:appraisal»CL1:  from  the
public.   At various parties, four out
of  six  released intros (so far) were
placed  »CL0:firs»CL1:t  and the remaining two -
»CL0:second.»CL1:   How can one explain this and
what is the cause?

[...] »CL2: Mavey:»CL1:   Hmmm...   it's hard to
say,  but  it  is  really so.  Perhaps
it's  just  because  I've always had a
small  hard  disc  ;) But seriously, I
very  much like making intros and find
it  exciting  to  »CL0:squeeze »CL1: in  as many
effects  as  possible and as you know,
as  far as it comes to demos, there is
always  enough space...  Besides, »CL2:Skip»CL1:
was  inspired by »CL6:"Stash"»CL1: & »CL6:"Jizz"»CL1: (»CL2:TBL
PC»CL1:),  and  wanted  very  much  to make
something  like that by using an »CL0:Amiga»CL1:
- and I think we made it.  Somehow, we
just  can't get down to making demos -
but  I think it's gonna change soon ;)
Surely  it doesn't mean we're going to
give  up  making»CL0: intros»CL1:.  I just wanna
show  what »CL0: Amiga»CL1:,  or  rather»CL0: we»CL1:, are
capable  when  it comes to making good
demos...   We  will see if we can make
it?  [...]

Let's   hope  we  can!   OK,  back  to
»CL6:Mekka/Symposium '2000»CL1:.  Apart from the
excellent»CL6: "Gift"»CL1:, »CL2:Potion»CL1: also released
»CL6:"Estadiol"»CL1:  -  a  demo coded by »CL2:Mavey»CL1:,
with graphics by »CL2:Nelson»CL1: and Soundtrack
by »CL2: Tzx»CL1:.  Interestingly enough, it was
placed  only »CL0:tenth»CL1: in demo-compo which
seems  strange  especially considering
the great skill of the members?!  What
was  wrong?   Why  was »CL6:"Estadiol"»CL1: only
placed tenth?

[...]  »CL2:Mavey: »CL1:  Actually  I don't know
myself!   People  at  the party simply
didn't   like   it   and  that's  all.
Besides  I'm  not the one to »CL0:judge»CL1:.  I
can  only  say  that the 3D Engine was
very   advanced  as  for  »CL0:68k »CL1: (though
hardly  anyone  knows  it!) because it
had   full   3D   »CL0:clipping»CL1:,  »CL0:z-buffer»CL1:,
»CL0:perspective-correction»CL1:  and  all  this
included  in  15  bits!   And still we
were  placed »CL0:tenth»CL1:...  I'm only hoping
that  the  next demo by »CL2:Potion»CL1: will do
better ;) [...]

Well,  soon  we  will have a chance to
find  out  as  there  is  going  to be
another  edition of the party in about
two  months  time.  In the meantime, I
asked  »CL2:Mavey»CL1:,  if  there  was anything
they  were  going  to  release  at the
upcoming party and...

[...] Yeees...  but I'm not sure if we
can make it as time is short.  After I
luckily   came  into  possesion  of  a
BVision,   the   plans  have  changed.
First  of  all,  I'd like very much to
show  the  advantages  of  Amiga  when
equipped  with  a  »CL0:PPC»CL1:  and »CL0:BVision»CL1: so
that  people, who are going to buy it,
don't regret their purchase.  Besides,
I'd  like  to code such demo as »CL6:"Gift"»CL1:
so people remember it for a long time.
Of  course,  I'm going to do this with
help  from the rest of the »CL2:Potion»CL1: team
;) [...]

Overall  »CL2:Potion »CL1: seems  to  be a group
which  is  rather  keen  on presenting
their  works on Western parties is not
afraid  to  do  so.  Do the Westerners
give   them  an  »CL0:inferiority  complex»CL1:?
Aren't  they afraid of being unable to
keep  up  with  them?   It is the West
which  has  for  many  years ruled the
scene after all?!

[...]  Mavey:   »CL2:What? »CL1: I see no reason
why  we  should  have  any inferiority
complex...   Not  at all...  It's more
and more easy to notice that it is the
West which should catch up with us and
not  the  other  way around.  You just
had  to  make  them  »CL0:realize »CL1: it and I
think   that   it   was  »CL6:"Gift" »CL1: which
contributed  to  this.  As a matter of
fact    ,   there   are   still   some
interesting Western productions but it
is  no  longer  the same.  While there
still  can  be a few interisting demos
found,  good»CL0: intros »CL1:are rather hard to
come  by...  Well, sometimes there are
some  but  when you compare the intros
presented   at   »CL0:Polish»CL1:   and  »CL0:Western»CL1:
parties...   no comment!  I think that
we  are  not  at  all  behind.  On the
contrary,  we  Poles  are  really some
capable  people  and  I  think  we are
going    to    keep   presenting   our
productions  in  the  West.  What will
this  result  in?   Well, we will see!
[...]

Back  to  the  story  of the »CL0:Bydgoszcz»CL1:
team.   We finally got to their latest
production  in  the  year  2000.   The
»CL6:"Suicidial"»CL1:  intro was released at the
»CL6:Sattelite»CL1:  party and it won!  I myself
have  seen it only twice and...  I got
shocked!   Bitching  code by»CL2: Mavey »CL1:and
»CL2:Diamond»CL1:,   graphics   by »CL2:  Nelson»CL1:  and
bitching  music by»CL2: Tzx»CL1:.  It's »CL0:amazing»CL1:!
If  they  are  going  to keep it up in
their  future productions, soon »CL2:Potion»CL1:
will be on top of the European charts!
Ups,   there   is   something  I  have
forgotten   to  mention,  namely  that
»CL6:"Suicidial" »CL1:   is    the   first  »CL0: PPC»CL1:
production of »CL2:PTN»CL1:!

[...] »CL2:Mavey:»CL1:  As for 68k I'm gonna say
only   one  thing:   Why  to  go  into
reverse?   I can understand the people
who  don't  own  a »CL0:PPC »CL1:but at the same
time  I  think it should be a»CL0: standard»CL1:
thing  (unfortunately it is not).  The
only  things which the »CL0:68k»CL1: can be used
for    in    the   future   are   some
»CL0:music-disks»CL1:,  »CL0:slide-shows»CL1:, or a decent
player  for »CL0:MP3»CL1:, among others, working
well  already in MC »CL0:68040/33»CL1:.  We will
see  what  is going to come of this...
[...]

Well,  this  is an»CL0: interesting»CL1: opinion
especially     when     taking    into
consideration  that  many  people,  in
particular  Westerners  (e.g.   »CL2:Wade»CL1:),
think  that  it is to no use investing
in  Amiga  and  thus buying a»CL0: PPC»CL1:.  At
the  same  time, however, we know that
there  are  several good Polish coders
who  recently bought a »CL0:PPC»CL1:.  What does
Western  sceners think about this what
is Maveys opinion on this?

[...]  Hmmm...  It's not enough to »CL0:buy»CL1:
a  PPC.  Firstly, it doesn't have that
much software and coding this yourself
is  not that easy...  But I don't give
a  shit  and  if  there  is  something
better than »CL0:68k»CL1: and »CL0:AGA»CL1:, I simply must
have  it  ;)  Some people say they are
short   of  cash...   Sorry,  but  I'm
surely  not  a  rich  guy and I had to
work really hard to afford my Amiga...
A  »CL0:year»CL1: passed before I could afford a
PPC  and  a BVision but I don't regret
it.   I'm  really  happy  that  people
still  buy  »CL0:PPC»CL1: especially if they are
coders  because  it  is thanks to them
that  we  can  still make something by
using  this  kind  of equipment...  As
for  the West I simply don't get their
»CL3:'policy'»CL1: and I hope they will see what
you can make by using a PPC and change
their minds...  Let's hope it won't be
too  late  or the Polish scene will be
far ahead :) [...]

This is the situation as far as »CL2:Potion»CL1:
is  concerned.   They  work  a lot and
make   really   »CL0:good»CL1:   things!   Their
»CL0:cooperation»CL1: is possible, because...

[...]»CL2: Mavey»CL1::  Most of us live close to
each  other so we can be »CL0:together»CL1: when
making new productions...  most of the
time  in  my place, which is sort of a
»CL0:base»CL1: [...]

Lately,  another coder joined »CL2:Potion»CL1: -
»CL2:Diamond»CL1:.  His first contribution could
be  seen  in  »CL6:"Suicidial"»CL1:  - the great
debut from Szczecin (»CL6:Sattelite»CL1:).

[...]  ...»CL2:Diamond»CL1:  is very good from a
technical   point   of   view...   and
sometimes  helps  me  a  lot.  When it
comes to »CL0:putting productions together»CL1:,
I do it myself as I can do it a little
better...   For example, »CL2:Diamond»CL1: wrote
a  raytraced  skeleton  in 256 colours
which  I  then converted into 15 bits,
added  many  new »CL0:objects»CL1:,»CL0: mist»CL1: as well
as»CL0: light »CL1:and »CL0:camera movements»CL1: and made
it  »CL0:faster»CL1:.   The result was the intro
which  was then presented at »CL6:Sattelite»CL1:
[...]

You  can  say  that the group is still
developing.  It is a stable team based
on  the  people from Bydgoszcz and the
surrounding   areas   that   has  many
interesting  »CL0:ideas »CL1: and  is  eager  to
work.    Worth   mentioning   are  two
music-disks   by   »CL2:Tzx»CL1:,   the  amazing
»CL6:"Schizofrenic"»CL1:  with excellent »CL0:design»CL1:,
or the latest »CL6:"Despair"»CL1: - the last two
was  put  together  by  a hard-working
»CL2:Mavey»CL1:,  with graphics by »CL2:Nelson»CL1: & »CL2:Caro»CL1:
and,  as  already  mentioned, music by
»CL2:Tzx»CL1:.     The    future   seems   quite
promising.  Of course, there have been
many  such  »CL3:'acclaimed'»CL1:  groups on the
scene  who,  with  no apparent reason,
either  fell  apart  or  shifted their
activities  to the »CL0:PC platform»CL1:.  It is
rather   hard  to  say  how  long  the
members  of the Potion group are going
to stick together.  The possibility of
moving  from  Amiga  to »CL0:PC»CL1: is from the
very start denied by »CL2:Mavey»CL1: himself:

[...] Honestly, if »CL2:Potion»CL1: were ever to
shift  to  »CL0:PC »CL1: we would have done it a
long  time  ago...  In Bydgoszcz there
is  even  a friendly group »CL2:Procreation»CL1:
(which   »CL2:Rem»CL1:   belongs  to  as  well).
Besides,  I  myself  have a »CL0:PC»CL1: at home
and »CL2:Nelson»CL1: recently bought a P2 500MHZ
but   somehow   we   just  don't  feel
attracted by the»CL0: PC scene»CL1:.  I only use
my  PC for writing programs in »CL0:C»CL1: and I
do it exclusively for »CL0:money»CL1:...  thanks
to  this  I was able to buy my »CL0:BVision»CL1:
:) I could have bought »CL0:Geforce»CL1: for the
»CL0:PC »CL1: but  I  didn't  ;)  As for writing
something  for PC, perhaps sometime in
the future...  but only as a part time
activity...   We are planning to write
some  game  in  3D  but as you know we
can't  do  it  on  Amiga  so the whole
thing  will  have to be made using »CL0:PPC»CL1:
and    »CL0:BVision»CL1:-equipped    Amigas   in
assembler and later on rewrite it in C
on a PC...  but it's in the future and
a   lot  may  still  change.   In  the
meantime,  the  »CL2:Potion»CL1: group still is,
and still will be, on the Amiga scene.
[...]

With  these  words I would like to bid
farewell  to  both  the readers of the
»CL6:"EuroChart"»CL1:  and  to the »CL2:Potion»CL1: group.
Let   »CL2:Potion »CL1:  further  »CL3:'explore' »CL1: the
possibilities  of  PPC-equipped Amigas
and  let  them  do it to entertain all
the demo and scene-fanatics!
