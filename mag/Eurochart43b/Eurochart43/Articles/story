                             ( A Coder's Hard Life )

Here  I'll tell you the whole story of
this  »CL6:Eurochart»CL1:  intro.  »CL0:Borin'»CL1:?  Hum,
there  are  a lot of things»CL0: behind»CL1: it!
Here we go..

All started by »CL2:Magic/Nah-Kolor's»CL1: mail,
which  contained something like "are u
interested   in  coding  the  next  »CL6:EC»CL1:
intro?".  At this time, I had produced
only  one »CL2:Nah»CL1: demo, »CL6:"Magic"»CL1: (presented
at   the   »CL6:mekka  2k1»CL1:),  which  I  had
finished  in  a  big hurry, but that's
another  story..   Of  coz I said yes,







but I didn't know all the problems I'd
encounter!

I  had  a  lot  of  time to code it (1
month?),   and  since  it's  a  »CL0:~132kb
intro»CL1:,  not too hard..  First problem:
I  had  to build a »CL0:site»CL1: for my school.
Humm..   How  can  I  merge school and
intro?    Hehe,  easy  I  thought:   I
decided to code a small java applet to
make  the  site  a  bit more beautiful
(*sik)..       What     about     true
»CL0:color-blurred »CL1:  particles?    Of   coz
besides  this applet, I was workin' on
an  easy  (keep  in  mind  I'm still a
beginner)  effect  for  the  »CL6:EC»CL1: intro.
All  worked fine, I made my »CL0:applet»CL1: and
coded the same effect in »CL0:100% 68k»CL1: asm.
"Hey  it  looks  great  guy!"  alot of
friends  told  me!   "Kehwl,  I'll add
some  text on it, and it'll make a new
effect for the intro!!"..

Well,  once  finished,  I heard:  "The
intro  must run »CL0:25fps»CL1: on a »CL0:030 non-fpu
4/8  mb»CL1:"..   Aaaargh..   Well, I don't
think  true  color  effects  fit 030..
Okee, »CL0:restart»CL1:!

Hum,  exams  are comin' very very very
fast..   And  this  time  I can't miss
them,  otherwise I can't study anymore
in    my    school   (greaaat   french
schools..).    "Keep  in  mind,  exams
first!   Otherwise  I'll  kick u!  :D"
hehe, not much pressure..

So  I  worked  a whole night during my
exams,  tryin' to make some stuff work
»CL0:together»CL1:..   Then I sent a -very- »CL0:lame»CL1:
intro  to »CL2: Darkhawk»CL1:,  no  time  to  do
something  else..   Damn,  I  forgot I
used  a  routine,  which  needs  »CL0:fpu»CL1:..
what sh*..

After  the  exams, I decided to recode
the  intro..   But  at  that  time  my
»CL0:grandmother»CL1:  died  and  I spent 1 week
far  away  from  my  Amiga, and then 1
week for a »CL0:java project»CL1: for school...

Just  after  that,  a beautiful girl I
know, »CL2:Marie»CL1:, told me she'll go back to
her   parents  for  holidays..   Damn,
she's..  well...  I don't think I must
explain..   So I tried to spend all my
days  with  her, and the intro huhuhu,
»CL0:5mins»CL1: per day?!

But  she  left, and I did »CL0:nothing»CL1:.  (2
meanings?..)

I  finally  recoded  the intro, it now
works without »CL0:fpu»CL1: (I hope!!), and only
one   effect  is  missing:   Truecolor
particles!  I hope it's not a too »CL0:lame»CL1:
intro..  :))

It's a hard life to be a »CL0:curder»CL1:, but I
love it!
