Alright,  »CL0:credits»CL1: coming up now.  Last
time,  in  the  general  »CL0:confusion»CL1: and
hurry,  I  seem to have forgotten some
people.    Well,  I  have  written  an
article  to  »CL0:excuse »CL1: that,  and »CL0:credit»CL1:
them.   But  enough  about that, let's
hope I am more»CL0: precise»CL1: this time, heh.

The code is the traditional one, fully
»CL0:multitasking »CL1:and »CL0:system-friendly»CL1:, even
works on »CL0:UAE»CL1:.  »CL2:Quedax»CL1: of Depth did the
original   code,  and  »CL2:Dr.   Doom»CL1:  has
»CL0:updated»CL1: it slightly for this issue.

The  two  »CL0:intropictures»CL1: have been done
by   »CL2:Wade»CL1:   of  »CL2: Haujobb»CL1:  and »CL2: Pix»CL1:  of
»CL2:DKG/Nah/SCN»CL1:  The  panels for this time
were   done   by »CL2: Java»CL1:  from  the  new
graphician  only group »CL2:Scenic»CL1:.  Thanks
to  you  3  great graphicians for your
»CL0:support»CL1:!

The  »CL0:musical »CL1: scores were done by »CL2:Curt
Cool»CL1:  of »CL2:Depth»CL1:, who did the 1st module
entitled   »CL6:Holiday  Way»CL1:.   The  second
module,  done  by »CL2: Genetix»CL1:,  is called
»CL6:Digital Solutions»CL1:.  Nods of »CL0:respect»CL1: to
both of you.

As  for  the »CL0:intro»CL1:, it was done mostly
by  the  »CL2:Nah-Kolor»CL1:  team.  »CL2:Tolkien»CL1: did
the  code,  »CL2:Dascon»CL1:  from  »CL2:IRIS»CL1: did the
music  and  »CL2:Imaks»CL1:  did some additional
design.   Thanks  to  »CL2:Tolkien»CL1:  for the
intro  and  being able to »CL0:bugfix»CL1: quite
fast.

As  for the mag »CL0:technical»CL1: things, also
called  »CL1:slavelabour»CL0:, the picture looks
like this:

Most       vote       and      support
collecting/begging  was  as usual done
by   »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:  while  the  votes  were
counted by »CL2:Adonis»CL1:, »CL2:Dr.  Doom»CL1:, »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:
and »CL2:Ransom»CL1:.  »CL0:Spellchecking»CL1: was done by
»CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:  and  »CL2:Nutman»CL1:,  while »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:
and  »CL2:Ransom»CL1:  put together the »CL0:gallery»CL1:.
»CL2:Adonis»CL1:, »CL2:  Darkhawk»CL1:   and   »CL2:Dr.    Doom»CL1:
coloured  the  articles, and »CL2:Dr.  Doom»CL1:
made  it  all »CL0: run»CL1:  and  »CL0:formatted»CL1: the
articles.

»CL2:Adonis»CL1:  completely  did  the  »CL0:News»CL1: and
»CL0:Adverts»CL1: sections of this mag.

And  now  for  the credits for writing
»CL0:articles»CL1:.   Last  time  we got quite a
lot of diverse articles from many nice
people.   This  time the content isn't
that »CL0: broad»CL1:, in regards to supporters,
but  we  still managed to put together
an   »CL0:ok»CL1:   amount  of  bytes  for  your
pleasure.   The  credits  here go like
this:
