                                 »CL5:by Darkhawk/IRIS
»CL1:
So,  what  diskmags appeared since the
last  »CL6:Eurochart»CL1:?  2 mags did, which is
not  too  shabby  at  all,  especially
seeing  that  »CL0:one»CL1: of those seemed »CL0:dead»CL1:
and »CL0: gone»CL1:.   For this issue, I will be
reviewing »CL6: Showtime  #16»CL1:  and »CL6:Devotion
#2»CL1:,  and  the  most interesting mag of
those is »CL6:DVN 2»CL1: I think, due to various
reasons  I  will  get  right  back to.
But, let's start with »CL6:Showtime»CL1: first.










»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:             SHOWTIME #16
»CL1:--------------------------------------

It's  nice with mags that get released
»CL0:regularely»CL1:  and get up above the magic
»CL3:'10'»CL1:  number,  and  with  this  issue,
»CL2:Darkage»CL1: show that they can bring out a
mag with new people at the lead.  »CL2:Zito»CL1:
is  the new »CL0:maineditor»CL1:, and after some
complications and a rather huge »CL0:delay,»CL1:
»CL6:ST16 »CL1: was released some days after the
»CL6:Mekka  Symposium »CL1: party.  The code has
been  shined up a bit by »CL2:Stingray»CL1:, but
it   is   still  basically  the  »CL0:same»CL1:.
»CL2:Stingray»CL1:  promises  a  completely  new
code for the next issue.  Whether that
will  delay  the release of that issue
remains   to   be  seen.   As  it  is,
»CL2:Stingray»CL1: has left his mark on the code
too,  including  3  »CL0:hidden parts»CL1:, 1 in
the  main  mag  and  2  in the gallery
part.   well,  »CL3:'secret'»CL1:  is  maybe the
wrong term for these, as he even gives
hints as to»CL0: how»CL1: to view them, heh.  As
he  says,  what  good is a secret part
you   don't  »CL0:see»CL1:?   In  any  case,  by
reading  his  .txt  and  by hexreading
through  the  gallery,  you can easily
spot what to do to get to those parts.
And I love the secret part in the main
mag, very »CL0:well done»CL1:!

Since the»CL0: magcode »CL1:is what you are used
to,  apart  from  the  »CL0:gallery»CL1:,  which
Stingray  »CL0:recoded  »CL1:completely,  I will
not  write  more  about  that  aspect,
except   to   say  that  while  I  can
somewhat easily survive that it is not
»CL0:multitasking»CL1:,  it  is a bit irritating
that  I  have  to  run it from a »CL0:clean
boot»CL1:,  to make it work on my »CL0:4060»CL1:, but
oh well..

There  is also an »CL0:intro»CL1: in ST 16, done
by  »CL2:Ephidrena»CL1:.  I would like to praise
it,  but  instead  I am going to »CL0:curse
it»CL1:,  for  consequently  »CL0:failing»CL1: to run
properly  on  my machine.  From »CL0:WB»CL1:, it
»CL0:crashes »CL1: the  machine,  from  a  »CL0:clean»CL1:
start  up,  the  whole intro is »CL0:slowed»CL1:
down  to  11  frames  a  minute or so.
Really  »CL2:Loaderror»CL1:,  how hard can it be
to  have  a  working  system  startup?
Nooo,  don't say my computer is weird,
heh...

Ok,  code  and intro aside, let's look
at  the  »CL0:graphics»CL1:  for this issue, and
the  quality  of  the  pictures in the
»CL0:gallery»CL1:.   The gallery itself features
a    different   code   and   a   nice
»CL0:blitterscroller»CL1:.   The scannings in it
are  of  an  ok  quality, but most are
quite..   Well, »CL0:boring»CL1:.  You know, why
not  focus  on  sceners running around
naked,  or  doing  other,  »CL0:embarrasing»CL1:
stuff?  Ahh well, might be hard to get
those  pictures, I know..  The picture
for  this part was done by »CL2:Asarhead»CL1: of
»CL2:Reason»CL1:,  and  is  an  ok  picture of a
girlish  head.   »CL2:Slayer/Appendix»CL1:  made
the  intropicture  for the mag, and it
is  a  refreshingly  »CL0:original»CL1: and nice
»CL0:pixel»CL1:  drawing  in  the »CL2: Slayer»CL1: style.
Cute!    »CL2:Cheetah/Ephidrena»CL1:   did   the
panels  for  this  issue, and they are
workable  and  fit  in  well, although
they're not overly»CL0: breathtaking»CL1:.

As  for  the  music.  The music in the
»CL0:gallery »CL1: was  done  by »CL2:Factor6/Reason»CL1:,
and  is  lively  and  fits the gallery
fine.   A  lot  of musicians have made
tunes for the »CL0:mag»CL1: itself.  Too many in
my  opinion.  There are 4 tunes.  »CL2:Curt
Cool/Depth's»CL1:    tune   is   good   and
relaxing,  well,  he  has  no  trouble
composing  mag  music, as you can also
hear  right  now,  in  this  mag.  The
second tune is made by »CL2:Dascon/IRIS»CL1: and
it  is  also  good, if a bit different
from  normal  magtunes  these days.  2
tunes  should be enough for most mags,
but  there're  2 more tunes, played as
the  3rd and 4th.  Don't know how many
people   actually  listened  past  the
first   2   tunes,  apart  from  other
»CL0:musicians»CL1:,  but  the  other tunes were
made  by  »CL2:Isaac/Contraz»CL1:  and  »CL2:THG/DCS.»CL1:
Both tunes are »CL0:cozy»CL1: and »CL0:relaxing»CL1:, with
guitary samples in the lead.

So, and now on to the 2 most »CL0:important»CL1:
parts.»CL0:   Chart»CL1:  and  »CL0:mag»CL1:.  The »CL6:ST»CL1: code
has  that  nice way of showing you the
ranked  people »CL0:slowly»CL1:, and their chart
part is stylish, but as for the amount
of »CL0: voters»CL1:,  that has sadly diminished
over  time,  if  this  downward spiral
continues,   I  guess  they  could  be
tempted   to   cut   out   the   chart
completely.  That would be sad, seeing
as  how »CL6:The Charts/Showtime »CL1:has always
had the chart, and been in competition
with »CL0: us»CL1:  in  being  the best»CL0: chartmag»CL1:
around.   Atleast  as long as we're on
top  in that competition, we'd hate to
see  the  »CL6:ST »CL1: charts  go.   The  scene
should  still  be  big  enough for two
chartmags.   The  amount of votes they
got  for issue 16 is »CL0:53»CL1:, and around »CL0:20»CL1:
of  those  they can thank »CL2:Punisher»CL1: for
collecting,  so  it  looks a bit bleak
for  them.   53  votes is also much to
»CL0:little»CL1:  for an international chartmag,
in  my  opinion.  And yes, easy for me
to  say,  I  know  I'm cruel..  On the
other  hand,  the actual »CL0:top-3»CL1: results
look a lot like the results in the »CL6:EC»CL1:,
also  with  under  half  the amount of
voters,  so  maybe  the  amount is not
THAT »CL0:important»CL1: for the results.

The mag itself is actually bigger than
is usual, which in itself is »CL0:positive»CL1:,
unless    the    articles   are   only
un-interesting fillers of course.  And
I must say, this issue of »CL6:ST »CL1:was a bit
»CL0:uninspiring»CL1:  to  read.   Grammatically
speaking,   the  mag  is  cleaner  and
easier  to  read  than in »CL2:Kaosmaster's»CL1:
days,  but it is still not good enough
in  my  opinion, although there aren't
many  spelling mistakes anymore, there
are    a   lot   of   convoluted   and
grammatically   incorrect   sentences,
which hinders my reading »CL0:enjoyment»CL1: and
»CL0:participation»CL1:  in  the articles, so to
speak.   It  is  not  enough  to spell
check,   you   also  have  to  correct
»CL0:grammar  »CL1:mistakes,  or you will end up
with a mag that is worse than it could
have  been, where readers are »CL0:skipping»CL1:
the  articles that are too hard to get
any  meaning  out  of, and that's sad,
since the writer of the articles might
have something »CL0:interesting»CL1: to say.

Anyway,  there  are  24 guest editors,
while »CL2: Zito»CL1: is the mained, followed by
»CL2:Ghandy»CL1: and»CL2: Dire»CL1: as co-eds.  So, as you
can  see, a lot of varied support from
outside  of the mainteam.  One special
thing  worth  noting is that»CL2: Gone/Void»CL1:
contributed with »CL0:13»CL1: articles, and also
has  his  own  »CL0:corner»CL1:.  That corner is
mostly  about  the past, »CL0:nostalgia»CL1: and
»CL0:swappers»CL1:,  which  some will positively
hate I am sure, but which I personally
found rather »CL0:endearing»CL1:.  It seems that
»CL2:Gone»CL1:  is a new editor we haven't heard
the  last  from.   I hear he will be a
permanent  part of the »CL6:ST»CL1: staff in the
future.   As  for the overall picture,
as  I  said,  it was not too »CL0:inspiring»CL1:
reading  the mag, not that many really
interesting   »CL0: topics »CL1:  or  »CL0: articles»CL1:,
although   the   »CL2:Repoman»CL1:  article  was
»CL0:hilarious»CL1:.   It took some time reading
through  the  articles,  eventhough  I
skipped  the  »CL0:5»CL1: or so »CL0:PC articles»CL1: that
are  still there, I respect»CL2: Ghandy»CL1: and
»CL2:Zito»CL1:  for  wanting  to  include  them,
although  I  think it is »CL0:nonsense»CL1:, one
can  see  that this time, they are not
included  simply  to get more support,
as  »CL6:ST16»CL1:  has  got  a  nice  amount of
article  support  atleast.  And I am a
firm  believer in all people to have a
right  to »CL0:express»CL1: themselves, contrary
to  some »CL0:elitist»CL1: mags, one of which we
will  review  shortly,  the  EC itself
usually  has  a lot of different »CL0:guest»CL1:
editors.   But  I feel that my verdict
on  the  »CL0:quality»CL1: of the articles would
have  been  much  lighter, had many of
them  not been so hard to »CL0:read»CL1:, due to
their   »CL0:grammars»CL1:.   This  is  not  any
attack  against  those  writers,  I am
sure  they do what they can to express
themselves,  and  that  is all that is
required   from   them,   but..   More
grammar correction please, »CL6:ST»CL1: editors,
and »CL6:ST»CL1: will be much better.

Lastly,  I find it quite low how »CL2:Modem»CL1:
is  attacked in the mag, explicitly by
»CL2:Stingray»CL1:,  who  might  be  excused  if
»CL2:Modems»CL1: code is really that bad, and he
had  to spend hours after hours on it,
but  to  be  this  rude  to»CL2:  Modem»CL1:  is
»CL0:uncalled»CL1: for.  And implicitly by»CL2: Zito»CL1:,
who  somehow manages to leave one with
the  impression  that  »CL2:Modem»CL1: sucks, by
only  mentioning  »CL2:Modem's »CL1: name  in  a
negative  context when he does mention
it,  and  probably knowingly intending
to  show»CL2:  Modem»CL1:  in a bad light.  It's
quite   »CL0:uncalled   for»CL1:  to  leash  out
against an ex-scener isn't it?  I know
there   are  some  »CL0:issues»CL1:  here,  some
interesting issues about the »CL0:animosity»CL1:
of    »CL2:Modem»CL1:   and»CL2:   Zito »CL1:  plus   some
complaining    on    »CL2:Modem»CL1:   being   a
»CL0:code-ripper»CL1: and whatnot, and if the »CL6:EC»CL1:
was   more  of  a  »CL3:'scandal'»CL1:  mag  I'd
probably  do  an »CL0:article»CL1: about it, but
frankly  I  rather  hope  this settles
down,    or    already  »CL0: is»CL1:   settled,
internally in »CL2:Darkage»CL1:.

And  now,  leaving  »CL6:ST»CL1: behind, we will
focus  our  attention on »CL6:Devotion 2»CL1:, a
mag  that  died, was reæeased as a »CL0:txt»CL1:
archive, was »CL0:reborn»CL1:, and which has now
been  properly  released 2 days before
the writing on this article began.

»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL0:             DEVOTION #2
»CL1:--------------------------------------

Now  this  mag  is REALLY interesting,
and  I suspect I will write a somewhat
lenghty   review,  so  bear  with  me.
First  off,  the  reason  why »CL6:Devotion»CL1:
isn't dead, is a tale in itself.  When
»CL2:Magic  »CL1:  released   his   »CL0:dvn2dead.lha»CL1:
archive, »CL2: Darkus»CL1: was looking for a way
to get rid of him, and still bring out
»CL6:Devotion   2»CL1:.    He   found   »CL2:Wade»CL1:  as
co-editor,  and  some others, and work
started  on issue 2.  Things didn't go
as smoothly as that however, as »CL2:Darkus»CL1:
apparently  abandoned »CL2: Wade»CL1:  at a time
when »CL6:Devotion»CL1: was finally ready to get
released.   No  emails  for weeks, and
the  mag  was practically ready.  Then
»CL2:Darkus»CL1:  answered,  saying he had had a
HD  crash, and that »CL6:Devotion»CL1: went with
it,  but  that  he  would  get back to
»CL0:recovering »CL1: the  data eventually.  No,
that  didn't  sound  very  »CL0:devoted»CL1:, so
»CL2:Wade»CL1:  decided to take matters into his
own  hands, ousting »CL2:Darkus»CL1: and most of
the   other  editors,  getting  a  bit
support  from  oldtime editor »CL2:Fishwave»CL1:
and  release »CL6:Devotion #2»CL1: with articles
mainly  from  him  and  »CL2:Sane»CL1:,  another
editor  who  had  quit  the scene some
years   ago,   when   »CL6:Seenpoint»CL1:  died.
»CL2:Ghandy  »CL1:has also written some articles
for this issue, so »CL6:DVN 2»CL1: seems to have
an    old    and   quite   experienced
»CL0:editorteam»CL1:.    This   makes   it  very
interesting, even before one reads the
articles  and  determines  the overall
style  of  the  diskmag.   But, I will
wait  with  the  articles, and look at
the other aspects first.

»CL0:Code»CL1:  wise, I will just copy and paste
most  of what I wrote for »CL6:Devotion #1»CL1:.
Not  that  I will write about the code
each  time,  when  it  does not change
significantly, but since this is a new
mag,  I  thought  that  summing up the
code once more was in its place.

Code  wise, the mag runs very well for
a »CL0: modern »CL1: mag, it is coded using »CL0:RTG»CL1:,
which  means  it  runs both on »CL0:AGA»CL1: and
»CL0:graphicscards»CL1:,  which again means that
e.g.   A2000  owners can view the mag.
I  tested  it  with both AGA and on my
EGS  gfxcard with CGX), and there were
no  problems  at all, it worked like a
»CL0:charm»CL1:.   The  mag  is multitasking and
quite   systemfriendly,   I  have  not
succeeded  in »CL0:crashing»CL1: it yet.  As for
the in-mag features, it has everything
you'd  come to expect, that is, fading
text,  multicolour fonts with gfxcard,
and  generally the mag looks and feels
like  »CL6:ROM »CL1: and derivatives, that is, a
»CL0:slider»CL1: in the bottom panel showing you
how long the article is, and moving as
you  change  page,  there are animated
»CL0:buttons»CL1:  and »CL0:musicindex»CL1:, but you can't
switch pages by moving the mouse close
to  the  end  of the screen, a feature
which  mags  in  the »CL6: ROM»CL1: design often
have (but I don't mind the lack of it,
it   gets  »CL0: annoying »CL1:  when  the  page
suddenly    switches    because    you
unintentionally   moved   your  mouse,
etc.).   Overall,  the code works well
and  feels»CL0: slick»CL1:, but there's not many
»CL0:visible»CL1:  features  in  the code, apart
from the normal ones in mags.  »CL2:Makke's»CL1:
article  in the mag about diskmags all
looking »CL0: alike»CL1:  springs  to mind (yep,
the »CL6: EC»CL1:  is  no exception, but I'm not
reviewing  our  own  mag  here, hehe).
»CL2:Mr.   Tickle»CL1: is responsible for coding
the »CL6:Devotion»CL1: engine.

Graphically,  the mag retains the nice
panels  from  »CL2:Adam/DCS»CL1:, which is fine,
since they are really good and fit the
mag   well.    »CL2:Zaac»CL1:   made  the  title
picture,  which  is  wonderful to look
at, I love his cute »CL0:pixel»CL1: style.  That
picture  you see when you use »CL0:RTG»CL1:, but
if  you  run  the  mag  on  a »CL0: non-rtg»CL1:
equipped    system,    you    get   an
»CL0:alternative»CL1: picture, done by»CL2: Wade»CL1:, and
also  looking  absolutely stunning.  I
really   hope  he  continues  »CL0:drawing»CL1:,
since  it  would  be  a  shame for the
scene,  if  such  a  talented guy »CL0:quit»CL1:
drawing.    »CL2:Optic»CL1:  made  the  »CL0:clipart»CL1:,
which   he  also  did  last  time,  so
actually  I  think  most,  if  not all
clipart,  are the same as for the last
issue.   The  cliparts  are  of a good
quality though, although there are not
that»CL0: many»CL1:.

»CL0:Musically»CL1:,  I  was  quite surprised at
hearing  the  title  tune  by »CL2:Chromag»CL1:,
since  I have heard that tune in a mag
before.   It  really nags me that I am
not  able  to pinpoint the mag without
browsing  through my mag »CL0:archives»CL1:, but
I   would   suspect   I  heard  it  in
»CL6:Generation»CL1:.   In  any  case, I'm quite
sure  it  has been used before.  Well,
the  module,  entitled  »CL6:'Zapping'»CL1:,  is
good,  no  doubt about that, afterall,
it's  »CL2:Chromag»CL1:.   »CL2:Curt  Cool»CL1:  made  the
second  tune,  which  is  called »CL6: 'The
Catch'»CL1:.   Yes, »CL2:Curt Cool»CL1: wants to make
music for »CL0:all»CL1: mags it seems.  The tune
is  ok,  but  nothing  »CL0:special»CL1:  in  my
opinion. »CL2: Reed/Damage »CL1:and »CL2:Jazz/Haujobb»CL1:
made  the  third  module, called »CL6:'Real»CL1:
»CL6:Jatsi'»CL1:.   It's  not  a style I usually
like,  so we skip right past it to the
»CL0:fourth»CL1:  module,  done  by  »CL2:Reed/Damage»CL1:
again,  called  »CL6:'Enseignment Funquis'»CL1:.
It's  funky  and  again,  I don't like
this style.  But yes, »CL0:4 modules»CL1:.  That
really  seems way too »CL0:excessive»CL1:, since
there're  not  that many articles, and
you  have to use your mouse to go into
a  music  menu to switch, meaning that
most  people will never listen to more
than the first tune, which is a »CL0:shame»CL1:.

But  now  then,  let's  have a lenghty
look  at  the  »CL0:articles»CL1: and the layout
and theme of those.

There  are  39  articles, not counting
the  »CL0:editorial»CL1:  coloumns.   It's a bit
fewer  articles  than  the  last  time
around, but they are written by a much
smaller  number  of  people this time,
infact  »CL2:Wade»CL1: and »CL2:Sane»CL1: wrote most, with
»CL2:Ghandy»CL1: and »CL2:Fishwave»CL1: contributing 10 or
so articles all in all.  So, the style
is  pretty consistent, with mainly two
writers   handling   all   the  »CL3:'real'»CL1:
articles    (»CL2:Ghandy »CL1:   mostly   writes
»CL0:interviews»CL1: and »CL0:partyreviews»CL1:).  Indeed,
there  is a theme throughout the whole
mag,  a theme that is most apparent in
»CL2:Sane's»CL1:  writing, but which »CL2:Wade's»CL1: also
shares  to  some extent.  More on that
later.

Wade  has chosen to make »CL6:Devotion #2»CL1: a
bit  of a »CL3:'scandal/rumour'»CL1: mag, in the
style  of  »CL6:RAW »CL1:and »CL6:Seenpoint»CL1:, although
this  mostly  shines  through  in  his
»CL0:Rumour   Mill»CL1:   and  »CL0: Mis  Quotations»CL1:.
Overall,  the  articles  are certainly
set to provoke a wide range of sceners
into    reacting,   with   provokative
articles  ranging  from (and this must
be  the  most unoriginal article topic
after  all  these years) »CL0:'The scene is
dead!'»CL1:  through  »CL0:'Magic - The Outcast'»CL1:
to »CL0: 'Busy  Doing  Nothing'»CL1:.   On  some
level,    the   mag   is   almost   so
provocative,  that  it  might  fail to
provoke     sceners     from     sheer
»CL0:overexposure»CL1:.  On the other hand, most
attacks  aren't  personal but »CL0:general»CL1:.
There're  3  people  getting slandered
directly  in  the  mag,  and  that  is
»CL2:Darkus»CL1:,  who  gets  accused  of  being
non-devoted, »CL2: Shane»CL1:,  who  is  an easy
target  for  dislike,  and  especially
»CL2:Magic»CL1:,  who  is the easiest target for
this  in  the  scene, heh.  Well, that
sort  of  style is totally ok with me,
see my article on»CL0: motivation »CL1:elsewhere
for an explanation on why aggressivity
is  good.   However, »CL0: overdoing»CL1:  it is
primitive,   and   the  »CL0:'The  Funeral'»CL1:
article  by »CL2: Shane»CL1:  struck me as quite
»CL0:pointless»CL1:   and  »CL0:boring»CL1:.   Apart  from
that,  I  welcome  the  style, we need
atleast one mag that is a bit »CL0:hard»CL1: and
might  seem  »CL0:arrogant»CL1: too.  It is good
for    inspiration,    really.     The
Misquotation  article  was maybe a bit
too  much.  I liked it, but if the mag
scene   had  been  bigger,  a  lot  of
editors  would have been angry with it
I  guess.   As it is, those of us left
are a peaceful lot, who are happy even
if  we  are  quoted  for  something we
never  said,  to someone we never said
it to, hehe.

As  for the »CL0:spelling»CL1: and »CL0:grammar»CL1:, it's
close  to  »CL0:perfect»CL1:,  certainly  better
than   can  be  demanded.   Especially
»CL2:Wade»CL1:,  as  grammar  checker and native
»CL0:englishman»CL1:  makes  the mag shine here.
It is always nice seeing »CL2:Wade's»CL1: fluent
and »CL0:diverse»CL1: use of words which are not
used  that  much  by  those who do not
have english as their mother language.
In addition, »CL2:Wade»CL1: is a natural writing
talent, so in short, it is a pleasure.
»CL2:Sane»CL1:    is    also   able   to   write
evocatively,  that  hasn't  changed by
his   2  year  absence.   As  for  the
articles  of  »CL2:Fishwave»CL1:,  they are well
done,  but  you don't get the feel and
appreciation for his writing, like you
did  in »CL6: Seenpoint»CL1:.   I  guess this is
because  he  didn't  write  that  many
articles,   and   wasn't  involved  in
actually  making  the  mag.   »CL2:Ghandy's»CL1:
interviews and reports are informative
and   worth  reading  too.   The  main
»CL0:emphasis»CL1: of the mag is on the articles
of »CL2:Wade»CL1: and »CL2:Sane»CL1: though, so let's look
more closely on those now.

Good  writing  style  aside, I suspect
that  many  sceners will be »CL0:put off»CL1: by
the   style  and  theme  in  »CL6:Devotion»CL1:.
»CL6:Devotion»CL1:   isn't  »CL6: Buzz»CL1:,  a  mag  some
semi-old   sceners   might   remember,
meaning,  it;s not a wide »CL0:conglomerate»CL1:
of  very  »CL0:badly written»CL1: articles, done
by  all sorts of sceners.  »CL6:Devotion»CL1: is
not  diverse,  doesn't cover all sorts
of  scenish happenings, people outside
of  the,  by  now,  quite small »CL0:editor
circle»CL1:,   might  not  appreciate  this
style  anymore.   Also, the relatively
advanced writingstyle might »CL0:discourage»CL1:
people  who  are not so well-versed in
english (after all, it's no fun if you
have  to  use  a »CL0: dictionary»CL1: to read a
»CL0:diskmag»CL1:).   Maybe  these  points  mean
that  »CL6:Devotion»CL1:  does not cater to that
wide a scenish audience, but rather to
the  fellow  »CL0:editors»CL1:  out there.  As a
fellow  editor,  I  am  very impressed
with  the  mag, and like it, but maybe
»CL2:Wade»CL1:  and»CL2: Sane»CL1: haven't really realized
that  this is not the, relatively, big
magscene  of  97-98, that the audience
for  this  kind  of  mag might be much
smaller.   I  don't  know this, I hope
not,  as»CL6:  Devotion»CL1:  is  a »CL0:quality»CL1: mag,
from   start  till'  finish.   Anyway,
since  I  usually agree on most points
with  what  Wade  writes,  I found his
articles     worth     reading     and
interesting,  but  what really made me
get  out  of  my comfy chair (well ok,
atleast  I  moved  a  bit) were »CL2:Sane's»CL1:
articles.     Very   provocative   and
inspiring, I think I have written some
articles  in  this  mag  already, as a
direct  result,  and  that  is  a good
sign,  usually  I  don't  get  as much
inspiration  as  I used to, by reading
other  mags,  but  this time there was
much material for my own articles.

When 2 people each have to write a lot
of  articles,  some  points tend to be
the  same  in  those articles, and the
general  theme  in  what  they  write,
tends  to  come to the light.  I mean,
after  15 articles on the scene by one
person,  in  one  mag, one must notice
some  similarities.   That is also the
case  here,  and  the overall theme of
»CL6:Devotion»CL1:,   shining   through,   is  a
problematic  one,  I think.  Now, »CL2:Wade»CL1:
and»CL2: Sane»CL1: are old sceners, and I really
mean  old  sceners,  who have followed
the  scene since the »CL0:A500 demos»CL1:.  This
tends  to  make  you  somewhat  biased
towards   »CL0:newer»CL1:   things,  you  get  a
certain »CL0: conservative»CL1:  outlook.  And I
know  this,  since I thought I was the
most conservative scener active today,
heh   (you  should  just  look  at  my
votingsheet..     Or..     Maybe   you
shouldn't...).  After reading »CL6:Devotion
#2»CL1:, I'm not so sure anymore.  Clearly,
the  interests  of both, but it shines
most   clearly   through   in  »CL2: Sane's»CL1:
article,  is  the  old  scene, the old
legends,  how it was once upon a time,
how  the  grass was »CL3:greener»CL1:, the birds
sang,  and  how  the grass is ash now,
how  the  birds are carcasses lying on
the ashes of the grass.  Ehrr, or not,
but   the  impression  one  gets  when
reading »CL6:Devotion»CL1:, is a focusing on the
»CL0:old»CL1:  scene,  on  the  »CL0:old»CL1:  values,  on
everything   being   better  and  more
important  back then.  Old groups like
»CL2:Anarchy»CL1:,  »CL2: Sanity»CL1:,   etc.,  are  being
mentioned as rolemodels often, and the
virtue  of doing demos like the famous
A500  ones  is being touted.  I mostly
agree on all those things the articles
go  on  about,  like  how much bigger,
better,  cooler,  more  skilled, etc.,
the  scene  was  in  the  past, BUT!..
This  is  not  something  to have as a
recurring  theme in an entire diskmag!
Not  »CL0:explicitly»CL1:  or »CL0:implicitly»CL1: stated.
It likely annoys the hell out of newer
sceners  (who  haven't been around for
10   years)   to   get  to  know  that
everything  was  much better then, and
sceners  more  skilled,  etc.   It  is
quite irrelevant going on and on about
the  merits  of  the  past  time,  and
writing articles about how the present
sucks,  when  it  is  the present that
counts  right now.  It is »CL0:demotivating»CL1:
and  it  »CL0:destroys»CL1: rather than»CL0: creates.»CL1:
We must make do with what we have now,
look  to  the  past with nostalgia and
try  to  learn  a  few  things, but we
should  not  wish back the past, or be
too  unhappy  with  what  we have now.
What  we have now is also good, albeit
different  from what once was.  In any
case, it has no place »CL0:alienating»CL1: newer
sceners   with   this,   it   is   not
constructive,  and  again,  I guess it
means  it  is mostly older sceners who
will really appreciate the articles as
a  whole, those who know what is being
hinted  at.   As  said  earlier, it is
mostly »CL2: Sane »CL1: explicitly writing about
this,  and complaining about the scene
being  »CL0:dead»CL1:,  that  new sceners killed
his old scene, and so on.  Seems to me
»CL2:Sane»CL1:  wants to get over the scene, and
that  is  easier  if  he  can convince
himself  and  others  that it is over,
that  it  is a shadow of itself, etc.,
thus  it  feels  easier for him to let
go.  But I don't think the »CL0:rest »CL1:of the
scene  is willing to let go for»CL2: Sane's»CL1:
sake, thankfully!

Ahh,  this  was  a  bit off the beaten
path  of  this diskmag review, but let
me  sum  it up then.  »CL6:Devotion #2»CL1: is a
»CL0:top-professional»CL1:    mag,   emphazising
»CL0:quality»CL1:  over  quantity  and  it has a
certain  flair.   It  has its share of
problems,  but I am mostly guessing at
those  problems,  since, in many ways,
this  mag  is written for persons such
as  me,  that is, old scenish »CL0:editors»CL1:.
Therefore   I   am   quite  favourably
inclined   towards   this   mag,   and
impressed  with  the  writing quality,
which  frankly,  I  haven't seen since
»CL6:Seenpoint »CL1: and »CL6: Generation »CL1: died  off.
Issue  2  is even better than issue 1,
and  I really hope we will live to see
an   issue   3   too,  with  the  same
maineditors.   I  just  hope they will
take  my critique to heart, and try to
get  more in touch with, and more of a
feel for, the present scene, otherwise
they   might  »CL0:alienate»CL1:  many  readers.
Still,  although not agreeing with all
points  in the mag, I haven't had this
enjoyable  and  consistent  a read for
some years.

One  last thing, I just heard that the
first  released  archive  of »CL6: Devotion»CL1:
contained the Ebola virus, so for your
own  sake, you should test this with a
viruschecker.   I hadn't had any virus
myself  for  7 years, when suddenly my
WB  wouldn't  start  up,  and 19 files
were »CL0: infected»CL1:.   I  didn't learn that
this  came  from »CL6: Devotion »CL1: until now,
so..  Take »CL0:care»CL1: with this.
