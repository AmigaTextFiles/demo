For  the  third  time, we present this
little  »CL0:subchart»CL1:,  for  the purpose of
determining who is the mest stable and
cool  swapper  around  right  now,  as
opposed to who can get the most »CL0:votes»CL1:,
or   opposed  to  those  swappers  who
havent  answered a mail for 3 years or
more.   Here you get the »CL0:results»CL1:, some
»CL0:remarks»CL1:  about  each swapper and their
addresses  too,  so  you can get right
down  to  writing  them  a  »CL0:letter»CL1: you
should  feel  sure  will  be answered.
So,  without  furthe  ado,  here's the
results for this time:






1.»CL2: Lahve»CL1:     »CL1: (1)
  »CL2: Punisher»CL1:  »CL1: (New) 
  »CL2: Makak»CL1:     »CL1: (2)

As  usual, only those swappers who get
atleast  3  recommendations from other
swappers  get  to be on the chart, and
this  time  we  have  3  swappers  who
scored  »CL0:equal»CL1:  here,  that is, who all
managed  to get »CL0:3 recommendations»CL1:.  So
»CL0:applause»CL1:  for them.  The reason why it
is  such  a close tie is probably that
we have too few »CL0:voters»CL1: for this little
subchart,  but  our gratitude goes out
to the few loyal people who voted.

Other  swappers  who  got recommended,
but  didn't  get  enough  votes  were:
»CL2:Angeldust»CL1:,  »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:, »CL2: Gone»CL1:,»CL2:  Jackobe»CL1:,
»CL2:Juen»CL1:, »CL2: Kempy»CL1:,  »CL2:Malmis»CL1:,  »CL2:Powerslave»CL1: and
»CL2:Zerox»CL1:.

As  usual, here's some words about the
swappers on the chart this time:

»CL9:Angeldust about Lahve»CL1:

He's  one  of  the  most  active  guys
around  the mailswap-scene these days!
A   friendly   swapper  with  megalong
letters   and   sum  real  good  scene
»CL0:supporter»CL1:!  His swapper-mag»CL6: "Sabotage"»CL1:
is   the   thing   that's   made   for
mailswappers  and  therefore I like it
so  much.   For this and other REASONs
it's  a  must  to  »CL0:contact »CL1: these guy!
Eventhough  it  leads to more work and
therefore  less  time for him to write
»CL0:megaevil-long-letters»CL1:!

»CL9:Darkhawk about Punisher»CL1:

It's  good  to see that »CL2:Punisher»CL1: is on
this  chart  again.  He was a bit slow
in  responding to mails for some time,
maybe  due  to  some  »CL0:exams»CL1:  he had to
focus  on,  but  that should be in the
past,  and  now  he's  hopefully ready
again.    Jonas   is  the  friendliest
swapper  on  earth,  writes  long  and
»CL0:interesting »CL1:letters, and gives you the
feeling  that  he  really  »CL0:cares»CL1: about
swapping  and  the scene.  It's always
good  to  get  a  letter from him, and
when  he  is active, he deserves to be
the »CL0:no.  1 swapper»CL1:, imo!

»CL9:Kempy about Makak»CL1:

Another   small   star   on   swappin'
nightsky, but this one shines more and
more just day by day.  I suppose he'll
reach   the  top  very  fast,  but  we
shouldn't  be surprised - it will just
be  a  natural way of »CL0:scene-evolution»CL1:.
Okay,  wanna  some details?  »CL2:Maciek»CL1: is
rather  fast,  is a great amee»CL0: maniac»CL1:,
he's young, and what's most important:
the  art  of  letter  writing  isn't a
problem  for him.  I can also add imho
he  was  born  to  do things like that
(»CL0:swapping   »CL1:of  course.   =)  He's  an
»CL0:elastic »CL1: sort of person, good material
for a »CL0:supernova»CL1:.  =) Check him!

»CL1:Well,  that's it for this time, in the
next  issue  of   the »CL6:EC»CL1:, we might add
even  more  content  to this »CL0:subchart»CL1:,
and  maybe  have  a  little  more text
especially  written  for  you »CL0:swappers»CL1:
out there, watch out for that!
