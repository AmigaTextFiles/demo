»CL0:»BIG:                                          One Mekka-Symposium Response
»CL1:»SML:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
»CL5:                                 by Dr. Doom/IRIS
»CL1:
Once   again   I   took  the  trip  to
»CL0:Fallingbostel»CL1:         to        attend
»CL6:Mekka-Symposium»CL1:.  Once again I endured
the  »CL0:inhumanity»CL1:  of  driving  half-way
around  the world in a »CL0:4-seater»CL1: with »CL0:5
people»CL1:  and  more equipment than you'd
normally transport on a large »CL0:truck»CL1:.

Although    the    »CL0:success»CL1:   of   this
particular  party  is still subject to
heated  »CL0:debate»CL1:,  there can't really be
any  doubt  that»CL6: Symposium »CL1:is the last
remaining  major »CL0:scene»CL1: event, now that
»CL6:Assembly»CL1:  and  »CL6:The Party»CL1: are competing
for  the title of »CL3:"least scene-related





party   ever"»CL1:.    One   way  in  which
»CL6:Symposium »CL1: excelled  this year was the
unbelievable  »CL0:number»CL1:  of releases.  No
less  than  »CL0:20»CL1:  Amiga  »CL0:demos»CL1:,  »CL0:5»CL1: Amiga
»CL0:intros»CL1:  and »CL0:4»CL1: Amiga »CL0:4ks»CL1: made their way
to  the  big  screen  along  with some
»CL0:great»CL1:  C64  releases.  Oh, and some PC
shit too.

This  could  represent a giant step in
the  right direction for the scene, at
least   if  it  becomes  a  »CL0:trend»CL1:  and
doesn't  turn  out to be nothing but a
weird »CL0:coincidence»CL1:.

But  while  everyone was totally »CL0:hyped
up»CL1:   after   learning  the »CL0: number»CL1:  of
releases  (and  I  admit I was to some
extent  too), I was »CL0:puzzled»CL1: to see how
much  the  scene  has  come  to  value
»CL0:quantity »CL1:  over   »CL0:quality»CL1:.    If   the
organizers  had  announced  »CL3:"we have 3
demos,   and   they're  REALLY  REALLY
good"»CL1:,   do  you  think  the  »CL0:response»CL1:
would've been the same?

Then  the  demos  were  shown and were
»CL0:applauded»CL1:  as  one  has  to  to  avoid
breaking any »CL0:hearts»CL1:.  But they weren't
really   that  »CL0:good»CL1:.   Personally  I'd
rather  have watched three really »CL0:good»CL1:
demos  than  those  20.   So  what was
»CL0:wrong»CL1:, then?

Aside  from  the  fact that I disliked
the general style of »CL0:music»CL1: (I found it
»CL0:uninspired»CL1: and »CL0:disharmoni»CL1:c, but that's
»CL0:taste»CL1:   I   guess),   and  that  »CL0:pixel»CL1:
graphicians  seem to have more or less
»CL0:died  out»CL1:  in  the  last  few years, I
could say that only a »CL0:few»CL1: demos showed
»CL0:codework»CL1:  worth  noticing.   The  rest
were  »CL0:littered»CL1: with »CL0:recycled»CL1: code, »CL0:bad»CL1:
code,  »CL0:really»CL1:  bad  code and some code
that  was  just so »CL0:bad»CL1: that I wouldn't
have  »CL0:enjoyed»CL1:  myself at all had I not
been  »CL0:drunk»CL1:  (as you have to be during
the important compos, mind you).

Moreover,   many  of  the  demos  were
»CL0:incomplete»CL1:.  Many sceners told me that
their  demos  were  actually»CL0: missing»CL1: a
lot  of things but they »CL0:had»CL1: to release
them  at  the  party  anyway.   I  saw
several groups (including »CL2:IRIS»CL1:, sorry)
»CL0:fighting»CL1:  to  the  very last minute to
get   their   demos   as  »CL0:complete»CL1:  as
possible,  and  some  didn't even code
»CL0:one»CL1:  line  before  showing  up  at the
partyplace.

And  some  of the »CL3:"demos"»CL1: weren't even
»CL0:demos»CL1:.  There was a »CL0:photoslide»CL1:, a (bad
but  funny) »CL0:animation»CL1:, and productions
that   would  normally  be  considered
»CL0:promo intros»CL1:.

To  further  reflect  how  many of the
demos  required  any  »CL0:serious»CL1: work, we
have  the  number  of  »CL0:intros»CL1:  vs  the
number    of   »CL0:demos»CL1:.    It's   common
knowledge  that  an  »CL0:intro»CL1:  is  a  lot
»CL0:harder»CL1: to put together at a »CL0:party»CL1: than
a  »CL0:demo»CL1:,  and  there were only »CL0:five»CL1: of
them, which is »CL0:less»CL1: than last year (if
I recall correctly.  I might not.  :)

Looking  past  the  low »CL0:quality»CL1: of the
releases, some other disturbing things
make   me   »CL0:question»CL1:  the  success  of
»CL6:Mekka-Symposium  2001»CL1:.   This  year we
saw  a »CL0:PPC»CL1: intro win against »CL0:68k»CL1: ones,
what   was  largely  a  collection  of
»CL0:animations»CL1:  won  the  »CL0:demo»CL1:  compo, the
audience  only  »CL0:reluctantly»CL1:  applauded
the  »CL0:real»CL1:  pixel  images  in the »CL0:pixel»CL1:
compo,  and  of  course  there was the
»CL0:abandonment»CL1:  of  the  »CL0:4-channel»CL1:  music
compo  which »CL0:used»CL1: to play an important
role  in  making  Amiga  sceners  feel
»CL0:welcome»CL1: and »CL0:appreciated»CL1: at »CL6:Mekka»CL1:.

I'm not saying »CL6:MS2001»CL0: was a bad party.
Because  it  »CL0:wasn't»CL1:.   In many ways it
was  really  good, in some even better
than  last  year's.  But other writers
will  probably  tell you all about the
»CL0:good»CL1:  things,  so  I won't bother.  It
was  a  great party, yes, but if you'd
come  interested  »CL0:ONLY»CL1:  in  the  »CL0:Amiga»CL1:
scene, you would've been disappointed.
