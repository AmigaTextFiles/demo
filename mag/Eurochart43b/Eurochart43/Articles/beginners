»CL1:
Lately  we  have seen some articles in
»CL6:ST16»CL1: and »CL6:DVN #2»CL1: directly or indirectly
»CL0:attacking»CL1:  so  called »CL0:newbies»CL1: and also
people  who have been in the scene for
»CL0:some  time»CL1:,  but who are not viewed as
»CL0:skilled »CL1: enough.  In »CL6:Showtime»CL1:, »CL2:Zito»CL1: is
pretty »CL0: harsh»CL1:  on this point, using my
article about the new group »CL2:Trinity»CL1: as
starting  point, »CL0:criticizing»CL1: the»CL0: worth»CL1:
of  the  group  in a rather »CL0:aggressive»CL1:
way.   Now,  to  put  it nice, this is
really  »CL0:low»CL1:,  heaping »CL0:judgement»CL1: on top
of  a »CL0:new»CL1: Amiga group, who is actually
trying  to  »CL0:produce»CL1:  something for the
scene.   I  know, »CL0:objective»CL1: critics is





ok, so that people can »CL0:grow»CL1: and »CL0:learn»CL1:,
but this article is  »CL0:not»CL1: objective and
it  only  aims to »CL0:destroy»CL1:.  New groups
need »CL0: encouragement»CL1:  and  »CL0:feedback »CL1: to
grow, instead »CL2:Trinity»CL1: get the opposite
here,  and  might just »CL0:die off»CL1: because
they  do  not  feel »CL0:valued»CL1:.  How is it
that some »CL3:'saved'»CL1: sceners believe they
can  just  »CL0:criticize»CL1:  new  sceners and
feel  cool  about  that?  How will new
groups  ever »CL0: emerge »CL1: and  »CL0:survive»CL1: the
first,  hard  period,  getting better,
when  they are harshly told to »CL0:die off»CL1:
or »CL0:go someplace else»CL1:, the scene is »CL0:not
for  them»CL1:,  etc.   That  is not just a
very  »CL0:intolerant»CL1:  view  to have, it is
also    »CL0:dangerous»CL1:,    because,   quite
frankly,  »CL0:most»CL1:  people started out  at
the  beginner  level.   In  fact,  you
wouldn't  be  »CL0:impressed»CL1:  when watching
the  early  productions  of »CL2:Ephidrena»CL1:,
»CL2:Haujobb»CL1:, »CL2: Loonies»CL1:  and others.  Not to
speak  of  the  old  »CL0:legendary  »CL1:groups
either.   What  would have happened if
some  »CL0:maineditor»CL1:  had told »CL2:Kreator»CL1: and
»CL2:Raistlin»CL1:  of  »CL2:Anarchy»CL1:  that  their new
group   »CL0:sucked  arse»CL1:,  and  that  they
should just »CL0:leave»CL1: the scene, and spare
people their »CL0:crap»CL1:?

Besides,  even though »CL0:newcomers»CL1: do not
develop  to  be »CL0:top»CL1: sceners, which you
can   never   really   »CL0:know»CL1:,   there's
something  called »CL0:common courtesy»CL1:, and
space  for  all.   Now,  I'm the first
person  to think some productions »CL0:lame»CL1:
or  »CL0:primitive»CL1:,  and  say  it aloud too
(read  our  »CL6:MS»CL1: production report), but
that doesn't mean I'd like to tell the
groups»CL0: responsible»CL1: to get the hell out
of the scene.  It's not that we are so
»CL0:small »CL1: and »CL0:desperate»CL1: that we need each
and  every scener we can get.  That is
also true of course, but that makes it
sound like »CL0:quality»CL1: doesn't matter, and
that  we would accept the worst »CL0:lamers»CL1:
imaginable,  just  to  get  »CL0:numbers»CL1: on
our  side  again.   No, it's better to
see  it  like  this:  What is the most
important  »CL0:quality»CL1:  a scener can have?
The   »CL0:spirit»CL1:   and   »CL0:will»CL1:   to »CL0: create»CL1:
something.   If  you have that »CL0:spirit»CL1:,
you  have everything you need to start
out.   Because  that  means  you  will
spend time »CL0:bettering»CL1: yourselves,  hour
after  hour,  trying  to  learn »CL0: code»CL1:,
»CL0:painting»CL1:,  doing »CL0:music»CL1:, or, taking the
easy  route,  writing »CL0: articles»CL1:,  heh.
Some  say  talent  is  »CL0:inherent»CL1:,  that
might  be, but you can at least »CL0:better»CL1:
yourselves  to  a certain »CL0:level»CL1:, where
your  productions are of a good »CL0:enough»CL1:
quality, just by wanting to, by having
the  right  »CL0:drive»CL1:  for  it.   Now,  we
should »CL0: respect»CL1:  and »CL0: help»CL1: new sceners
with  that  spirit,  we should »CL0:nurture»CL1:
them  and  help  them  »CL0:grow»CL1:,  both for
»CL0:their»CL1: sake and for »CL0:ours»CL1:, and no matter
how  »CL0:bad»CL1:  they  are, and no matter how
»CL0:far»CL1:  we  think they will go, we should
not  tell  them  it would be better if
they  just  went away, as long as they
have  that »CL0: drive»CL1: in them.  That would
be  a very »CL0:rude »CL1:and »CL0:unscenish»CL1: thing to
do.
Now,  that  was the first half of that
article,  now  let's  have  a »CL0: look»CL1: at
those  sceners,  who  are  not »CL0:newbies»CL1:
anymore,  who  have  »CL0:been »CL1:in the scene
for  »CL0:some»CL1:  time, and who have produced
»CL0:some»CL1:  stuff  for  it.   It is here the
»CL6:Devotion»CL1:  staff sets in with »CL0:critique»CL1:.
And  this  is more in line with my own
views  on  the  matter.  »CL0:Newcomers»CL1: are
quite simply mostly excused for making
crap  or  boring production, even I (I
know it sounds »CL0:unbelievable»CL1:..) started
out  doing,  at the very least, »CL0:boring»CL1:
CLI  packs,  but  the  situation looks
much  different when you have a group,
who,  after  some  time, still is only
producing  »CL0:crap»CL1:,   and  whose  members
seem  to  be  rather »CL0: unskilled»CL1:.  What
then,  is it ok to say that they are a
»CL0:part»CL1:  of the scene too, and that's it?
Yes  and  no.  Not 'no' as in »CL6:Devotion»CL1:
surely,  that  is really »CL0:narrow minded»CL1:
and  »CL0:bigoted»CL1:, telling unskilled people
to  »CL0:buzz  off.»CL1:  Well, if they have the
»CL0:spirit»CL1:  I  wrote  about, that is.   If
not,  it  is  quite »CL0:justified»CL1:, telling
them   to   either  sod  off  or  pull
themselves    together    and    start
»CL0:bettering»CL1: themselves.  But if you have
the  spirit  and  the  drive, you will
eventually,   end   up   »CL0:producing»CL1:  or
»CL0:participating»CL1: in something acceptable,
I  think,  even if that means you have
to  »CL0:leave»CL1:  your »CL0:undedicated »CL1: group and
find another.  If you yourself want to
»CL0:better»CL1: yourself, and to spend »CL0:hours»CL1: on
it,  then  it's only a matter of »CL0:time»CL1:,
and  then  you  have some »CL0:potential»CL1: in
you,  which  it  would  be  »CL0:sad»CL1: to see
going  to»CL0: waste»CL1:.  However, there might
be  groups around, who don't feel that
this  is  overly  »CL0:important»CL1:,  that is,
how    good    people   »CL0: think  »CL1: their
productions are.  They might »CL0:like»CL1: what
they  do,  and  might  not »CL0: strive »CL1: to
better  themselves.   And other people
might  view them as people spreading a
lot  of  unnecessary  »CL0:garbage»CL1:  in  the
scene.   I think that's how »CL2:Wade»CL1: views
»CL0:some »CL1: groups  out  there.  But I can't
see  the  danger  in  this.  It's  not
like  they  are  »CL0:polluting»CL1:  our scene,
making »CL0:everybody»CL1: strive less hard.  At
least  I  don't think this is the case
now,  but  if there was a »CL0:lot»CL1: of these
groups,  this  might indeed become the
case.   As  it  is now, every group on
the  scene  does  its  own  thing, and
looks  for »CL0:inspiration»CL1: in those groups
that  are  seen  to  be as good as, or
better, than»CL0: itself»CL1:, so there's really
no  »CL0:problem»CL1:, let the groups who have a
different   »CL0: style»CL1:    and    »CL0:mentality»CL1:
regarding  the  scene (e.g.  the scene
is  there  for  the  fun of it, and to
share  with others, not mainly to make
better  and better »CL0:demos»CL1:) have their v
iew,  try  to  »CL0:enjoy»CL1: or »CL0:smile at»CL1: their
prods,  and try not to »CL0:patronize»CL1: them,
looking   »CL0:down »CL1:  on  them.   They  are
certainly   not  »CL0: ruining »CL1: our  scene,
although you might think so, from your
lofty, »CL0:elitist»CL1: abodes.  There's enough
room  for  »CL0:everybody»CL1:,  if one does not
like  a  »CL2:Loonies»CL1: demo, one can like an
»CL2:Ephidrena»CL1:  one  ,  an »CL2:IRIS»CL1: one, a »CL2:Mawi»CL1:
one,  etc., there are enough styles to
go  around,  and  if there's something
that  »CL0:destroys»CL1:  the  demos,  it's  the
»CL0:3D-scene »CL1: style,  not supposedly »CL3:'bad'»CL1:
groups doing »CL3:'crappy'»CL1: productions.

At  a  time,  everybody started out in
»CL0:demomaker»CL1:.   It  was »CL0:ridiculed»CL1:, viewed
with  »CL0: fear»CL1:,   »CL0:despised»CL1:,   etc.,   but
everybody  in  a  certain »CL0: age»CL1:  had at
least one try with his, partly because
they   couldn't   do  anything  better
themselves,   partly  because  it  was
»CL0:easy»CL1:.   But  this  did  not ruin those
sceners  who tried it, those with  the
right  »CL0:drive»CL1:  for  the scene continued
onwards  after  that  and became known
and »CL0:skilled»CL1: people.  Complaining about
people's lack of skill in the scene is
»CL0:unconstructive»CL1:.   Helping  them better
themselves  is  »CL0:constructive»CL1:.  And you
can   even   help   sceners  do  that,
passively,  by  not  »CL0:slagging»CL1: them off
totally,  but  being  »CL0:constructive»CL1:  in
your  critics,  or  just being »CL0:silent»CL1:,
and  see  what  happens.   No  need to
»CL0:scare  off»CL1:  people,  because you think
you  are  better  than  they, and thus
they  should  not  be »CL0:allowed»CL1: to be in
your fine, »CL0:elitistic»CL1: scene.

There're  two  meanings  of  the  word
»CL4:lamer»CL1:.  An »CL0:unskilled»CL1: and/or »CL0:blundering»CL1:
»CL0:newbie»CL1:  as  it  is  commonly used, but
also    a   generally   »CL0:arrogant»CL1:   and
»CL0:unpleasant»CL1:  type  of person.  So watch
out  it  doesn't »CL0:backfire»CL1: when you use
the word..
