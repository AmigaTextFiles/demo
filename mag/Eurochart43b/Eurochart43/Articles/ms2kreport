After     patient     »CL0:money    saving»CL1:,
long-termed   »CL0:travel   organizing»CL1:  and
after  a  remorse  just  like »CL3:"why the
hell  I haven't attend Mekka'2k?"»CL1:, the
day   finally   came,   when  we  (me,
»CL2:Fido/Insanity»CL1:,   »CL2: Factor6/Reason»CL1:   and
»CL2:TDM/Horizontal  Lamerz»CL1:)  hit  the road
from  »CL0:Prague »CL1: center sitting in »CL2:Fido's»CL1:
very   comfortable   car  directly  to
»CL0:Deutschland»CL1:,   concretely   into   the
»CL0:Heidmark  Halle»CL1:  situated  in the very
neat  town  of  »CL0:Fallingbostel»CL1:  between
»CL0:Hannover»CL1:  and »CL0: Hamburg»CL1:  where there is
»CL6:Mekka-Symposium»CL1:   is  organized  on  a
regular  basis.   After »CL0:seven hours»CL1: of





travelling,  being lost in »CL0:Dresden»CL1: due
to   very   bad   weather   and  after
five-minutes   of   looking   for  the
parking,  our  crew finally arrived on
saturday about 17:00 near the big hall
where party was taking place.  Because
the  whole  party  started  already on
Friday, we were welcomed by a huge and
»CL0:full»CL1:  parking  place  and  a  separate
»CL0:sleeping »CL1:  place   (not-so-well-heated
tent  behind the hall).  We paid »CL0:70DM»CL1:,
got     blue    »CL0: ID-badges»CL1:    as    an
identification   and   picked  up  the
voting      sheet...      I     missed
identification  cards  with»CL0: handles»CL1: on
to  easily find our friends.  It looks
like  a  minority, but it can help you
to  find  your  friends inside the big
hall.   In  this  case you had to walk
around and lean on your good »CL0:faces»CL1: and
»CL0:names  »CL1: recognizing.    It   wasn't  a
problem to me, so I finally found many
friends which I knew only from »CL0:IRC»CL1:.

The  first  day  seemed  to  be  a bit
»CL0:chaotic »CL1: and »CL0: stressed»CL1:, especially for
my  Czech  co-travellers  which didn't
know  anyone  at the party so they had
to  limit  themselves to some »CL0:boozing»CL1:,
walking around, finding a place to sit
and  watch  the big screen where there
was  always  something  to  watch  on.
Some  bolder people could find someone
to  talk to, surely in »CL0:english»CL1:.  Well,
there  were a lot of people of various
»CL0:nationalities»CL1:   just   like   Germans,
Norwegians,      Poles,     Frenchmen,
Spaniards,  Italians, Dutchmen...  all
those  people came to Fallingbostel to
have fun there.

Although  the »CL0:hall»CL1: was huge, is wasn't
hard  to find some friends there.  the
groups  had own names on the pieces of
linen  above them sticked on the wall.
The  people  sitting in front of their
»CL0:computer »CL1:  the  entire  party  weren't
sceners,    but    the    very   known
»CL0:porno-watchers»CL1: and »CL0:quake players»CL1:.  The
organizators  made  it  easy for us to
find  our  friends  by  calling  their
names   using   the  microphone.   For
example:  "»CL2:Shakul»CL1: is looking for »CL2:Lahve»CL1:
and  the  rest  of the people from the
»CL0:Czech republic»CL1:.  Please go to the info
desk »CL0:now»CL1:!".  I discovered all messages
were   being  called  out  in  english
language.   I  have  to  concede  that
organizers   kept  all »CL0: deadlines »CL1: and
starts of the »CL0:competitions»CL1:.  They also
planned   something   »CL0:in  between»CL1:  the
compos.   I  cannot  forget the superb
parody  of  the  knowledge  game  "Who
wants to be a millionaire" ("Who wants
to  be a »CL0:scenionaire»CL1:?"), the successor
of   computer  virtual-guide  »CL0:Max»CL1:  who
moved his mouth following the voice of
one of the organizers.  There was also
spontanous »CL0:music»CL1: played on »CL0:didgeridoo»CL1:,
»CL0:drums»CL1:,  »CL0:guitars»CL1:,  »CL0:pipe»CL1:,  etc, were the
musicians  smoked a joint of »CL0:ganja»CL1: for
their inspiration ;).  Sometimes, they
played  some  funny  »CL0:animations»CL1: on the
screen.   I have to say, the party was
great  in  this  sense.  Let's move to
the  different  side talking about the
defects.

I  can  live  with he absence of visit
card   with  »CL0: handles»CL1:,  but  the  main
problem  was  the  organizers recorded
some  demos  and  intros on »CL0:video »CL1:tape
which   caused   very  bad »CL1: sound »CL1: and
»CL0:picture »CL1: quality.   Amazingly,  nobody
noticed  it. »CL5:(we saw it -ed.)»CL1: The next
questionable  thing  was the system of
compo supports.  »CL0:Readme»CL1: files for each
competition  on  disks  I  gave to the
organizers  didn't  seem  to be enough
and  I  had  to  fill  out unnecessary
»CL0:paper»CL1:  sheets with handle, group, real
name,  e-mail address (?) and complete
address   (??).   Without  this  paper
sheet, the entries wouldn't be used in
the compo.  A too »CL0:strict»CL1: and »CL0:strangely»CL1:
organized   composystem   caused   the
absence  of  some pictures and music I
brought  with me, promising my friends
to  use  it for this party.  It wasn't
possible  to discuss anything with the
organizers  because  they  were hiding
above  the  main  entrance  in a »CL0:glass
cabin»CL1: ;).

We  weren't  so  long at the party, we
decided  to leave early monday morning
(rather  than  going  at  night) so we
managed to watch the Amiga »CL0:demo compo»CL1:.
Originally  we  wanted to see PC demos
as  well, but all compos following the
Amiga  demo  compo were delayed due to
the  »CL0:high  number  of  entries»CL1: in that
compo.   The  organizers simply hadn't
recorded  all entries on tape (another
reason  to  run  all demos live from a
computer)  and  the  next  compos were
delayed  about »CL0: 2  hours»CL1:.   This  also
means that I cannot describe the whole
party.   I  hadn't  seen  neither  the
»CL0:opening  ceremony»CL1:, nor the final »CL0:price
giving»CL1:.   But  after  all  I'm  glad I
visited   one   of   the   best   »CL3:"not
only-Amiga" »CL1:   party    these    days.
Although the party was multi-platform,
Amiga  clearly  ruled  there which you
could  tell from the reaction from the
crowd as the Amiga demo compo started.

Despite   too  high  prices  on  »CL0:food»CL1:,
»CL0:drinks»CL1:  and »CL0:entrance»CL1:, very bad»CL0: weather»CL1:
and  some  small »CL0:organizing mistakes»CL1: I
have  to  say  I liked this party very
much.   I  still  don't know if I will
attend  next time.  I don't want to go
by  train  and  I  doubt I could force
»CL2:Fido»CL1: to take us there by car again ;).
So     who     knows...     Definitely
»CL6:Mekka-Symposium»CL1:,  our favourite german
word  we learned (hi »CL2:Fido»CL1:, »CL2:Factor6»CL1: and
»CL2:TDM»CL1:)  and  »CL2:Bolda's»CL1: »CL0:SMS»CL1: messages during
our trip to Germany rulez ;).
