»CL7:»SML:--------------------------------------

»CL1:Aww man, this is an almost
useless article.. I mean, here we tell
you when the »CL4:deadline »CL1:for the next
issue is, aswell as some other
specific things, but hey, that
deadline never holds. Infact most of
you first »CL4:start supporting »CL1:us after
the deadline, ehrr. But anyway:

»BIG:»CLA:            30th October 2001
»SML:»CL1:
.. is the deadline. Or rather, after
this date, we begin forcing »CL4:people »CL1:to
»CL4:support »CL1:us and put together the mag,
but if you send in your support
earlier, it would be rather much
appreciated, then the mag could
actually get out right after. Ahr, in
any case we will be releasing »CL4:3 EC's
in 2001»CL1:, that might be a little less
than in the past, but it's still
respectable, I think. So, without
further ado.. This little notify
article ends.. With the hope that you
have enjoyed this issue of the EC.
All kinds of »CLC:feedback »CL1:and »CLC:suggestions 
»CL1:is »CLC:appreciated»CL1:. See you in another
issue and maybe in real life too!
