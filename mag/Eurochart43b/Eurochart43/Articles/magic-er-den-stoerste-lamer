»CL0:    Hard Bounced Diskmag Critisism
»CL1:--------------------------------------

Ideas have faded into »CL0:oblivion»CL1:.  There
aren't any new and innovative subjects
left  which haven't been written about
in   the   past.   Almost  every  »CL0:Very
Important  Scener»CL1: has been interviewed
already.    Report's   discribing  the
state  of  a  scene country or a group
have  all been done before.  There are








only  a  handfull of interesting scene
»CL0:parties»CL1:  left  to  write  fragile  and
non-quality  party reports about.  The
»CL0:Polish»CL1:   connection   is  one  hundred
percent debated; That's for sure!  The
»CL6:Eurochart»CL4:s»CL1: and »CL6:Showtime»CL1: survive trough
headhunting  for votes.  (It's a laugh
to   see   »CL2:Darkhawk»CL1:  asking  virtually
everybody  at  »CL0:#amigascne»CL1:  to vote the
last few weeks before the release of a
new »CL6:Eurochart»CL4:s»CL1: issue.) »CL2:RokDaZoNe»CL1:, »CL2:Mop»CL1:,
»CL2:Astro  Wolfman»CL1:  & »CL2: Mount»CL1:, »CL2:Lord Helmet»CL1:,
»CL2:Macno»CL1:, »CL2:Cybersonik»CL1:,»CL2: Colorbird»CL1:,»CL2: Diesel 8»CL1:
and alot more editors quit writing and
are  living their own lives.  And what
about  those  diskmags  we  can't read
because  they  are  »CL0:Polish»CL1: only ?  All
writing  styles  have  been  explored,
nothing  new  to  gain  there  either.
»CL0:Comebacks»CL1:  or a small»CL0: re-appearence»CL1: by
old writers have already been made and
done.   These  day's most articles are
based  on  the personal »CL0:opinion»CL1: of the
writer,  how  »CL0:egoistic»CL1:,  how »CL0: selfish»CL1:.
Where   is   the  balanced  stream  of
»CL0:quality»CL1:  and  »CL0:interesting»CL1:  articles we
knew in earlier times when for example
»CL6:Upstream»CL1:,»CL6:  Rom»CL1:, »CL6: Raw»CL1: and »CL6:Seenpoint»CL1: got
released  ?  There is nothing new left
to  explore  with  writing.   There is
nothing      left     than     selfish
»CL0:ego-stimulation»CL1:,   »CL0: mud-trowing»CL1:    and
provocative  »CL0: spandimerda»CL1:!   We  don't
need such articles with a goal to lift
some »CL0: reaction»CL1:.   And  then  those »CL0:old»CL1:
writer's  who  haven't  been following
the  scene  the last few »CL0:years»CL1: but are
still  trying to write articles.  They
can't  do anything else than cover old
topic's,  write  about things from the
»CL0:past»CL1:   or   write  those »CL0: mud-trowing»CL1:,
selfish »CL0:   spandimerda»CL1:!    You   know,
nothing  lasts forever, some things we
will never understand, we just need to
»CL0:accept»CL1:  the  situation  of  the  Amiga
scene journalism anno domini 2001 !!!

»CL0:          MPEG Amiga Demos..
»CL1:--------------------------------------

Not  so  long ago, about a month after
»CL6:Mekka-Symposium  2001 »CL1: some sceners at
»CL0:#amigascne»CL1:  including  me  started  to
discuss a nice »CL0:www »CL1:site which has alot
of  Amiga Demo's online..  Nothing»CL0: new»CL1:
so  far,  unless you are a PC user now
and  still  want  to  see  some  Amiga
demo's..   No,  don't  use »CL0:WINUAE»CL1:, THE
amiga »CL0: emulator»CL1:  on  PC,  but download
some   nice  amiga  demo's  from  this
fabulous                      website:
»CL0:http://omr.planet-d.net/amidemos»CL1:.  All
the  demos  featured online are »CL0:mpeg's»CL1:
(in»CL0: divX»CL1: format) , a very nice service
to  see  some  older  and new demo's..
Some   demos   from  »CL6: ms2k1  »CL1:are  even
online..   Ofcourse you need to have a
»CL0:fast»CL1:  connection because a simple demo
is  already  around »CL0:20mb»CL1: to download..
Yes,  the  PC  scene  should be really
»CL0:scared»CL1:   now!!   A  sudden  change  of
cultures is at hand!!

»CL0:  Devotion continued with new Staff..
»CL1:--------------------------------------

Thank  you  »CL2:Wade»CL1:, »CL2:Ghandy,»CL1: »CL2:Fishwave»CL1: and
»CL2:Sane»CL1: for releasing »CL6:Devotion issue 2»CL1: !!
To  continue the magazine »CL2:Darkus»CL1: and I
put  a  lot of effort in, in the past.
I  know you are very »CL0:proud»CL1: to continue
the diskmag of your two most favourite
writers.   You certainly feel the same
now as »CL2:Astro»CL1: did when he took over»CL6: RAW»CL1:
from»CL2: Lord helmet»CL1:!!  I know it has cost
you guys alot of time and hard work to
write   the   articles   and   getting
»CL6:Devotion  2»CL1:  finally released.  Not to
mention  how  irritated you all became
when »CL2: Darkus»CL1:  left you all silent like
he  did  with  me  (did he ?:) when we
were  working  on »CL6: Devotion issue 2»CL1: in
the beginning of »CL0:2001»CL1:!!  Ofcourse »CL2:Sane»CL1:
could  also not leave this opportunity
to  write  other »CL0:spandimerda»CL1: sentences
about  me,  how  trustworthy  he looks
now!!!  I am eagerly waiting for a new
issue  in  the  future.  Ofcourse even
better trough more hard work sweat and
tears  by  the former »CL6:Seenpoint»CL1: staff.
Ofcourse   with   even  more  shocking
contents for the scene to read and get
»CL0:irritated»CL1:  by.   We  all know now that
you  guys  are  the best diskmag staff
ever!!   By  the  way, there is a very
good  chance  that  the »CL6:devotion»CL1: staff
will  also  be  trown out for issue 3.
»CL2:Zerox»CL1:  and »CL2: Lord  Helmet»CL1:  are  already
plotting  a  hostile takeover together
with »CL2:Mr Tickle»CL1: for this..  In the mean
time  »CL2:Darkus»CL1:  and »CL2:Magic»CL1: have their own
fun!   Our  plan worked!!  »CL6:Devotion»CL1: is
still  alive, and we didn't have to do
a  single  thing for it.  We irritated
the  former »CL6:Seenpoint»CL1: staff, and above
all  even  »CL6:Devotion issue 3»CL1: might come
some  day  soon!!!   Thank  you guys!!
Darkus  can  now be a fulltime father,
while  I can concentrate on other more
»CL0:important»CL1: diskmag projects!!
