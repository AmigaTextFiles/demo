Yet  another  »CL6:Eurochart»CL1:,  yet  another
»CL0:misunderstanding»CL1:  between  some »CL0:polish»CL1:
sceners  and  western »CL0:top-of-the-pops»CL1:.
I  read some articles about »CL3:"wars"»CL1: and
think   it   becomes   more  and  more
»CL0:ridiculous »CL1: every  day.   You see, the
»CL3:"boycot"»CL1:  is over (I hope) and support
from  all  over  the  world  comes  to
»CL6:Eurochart»CL1:  editors  as always.  I just
want  to  add  some words with a small
»CL0:comment»CL1:  on  it all.  And please don't
respond to this, ok?  It`s over.

At  first  I was shocked while reading
»CL2:Punisher`s »CL1:   article    where    this





»CL0:Norwegian»CL1:  swapper  treats me like the
most  popular  polish  »CL0:provocator»CL1:.   I
want  to  ask  you,  »CL0:Jonas»CL1:, why do you
think  of me like this?  Did I ever do
anything  that  »CL0:hurt»CL1: you or something?
»CL2:Mcr»CL1:,  in  the name of »CL3:"commitee"»CL1: wrote
an article about the »CL0:leadership»CL1: of the
»CL0:boycott»CL1: (there's no »CL0:leadership»CL1: at all,
for being honest) and I`m not the »CL0:head»CL1:
of it.  I wonder why people could have
so »CL0:stupid»CL1: thoughts like you and I have
no  answer  to  that question.  Sorry,
I`m   out   of  »CL0:ideas»CL1:.   The  socalled
»CL0:boycott»CL1:  of  the »CL6:Eurochart»CL1: was a total
spontaneous  initiative of some »CL0:boozed»CL1:
sceners  on  a small »CL0:meeting»CL1:.  For the
first  the  boycott  was a deep»CL0: secret»CL1:
and  we  do  not  want  to  spread any
»CL0:official»CL1: news in order to avoid panic,
misunderstandings  or  anything  else.
This  was a»CL0: private»CL1: initiative, deeply
underground   just  for  proving  some
»CL0:theories»CL1:,  but  as you know very well,
some  other  guys  spread  the  »CL3:"news"»CL1:
around.    »CL0:Official »CL1:  statements  were
»CL0:squashed»CL1: and »CL0:distorted»CL1: into a bunch of
»CL0:gossip»CL1:.   This  gossip  was translated
into »CL0: english»CL1:  and  spread around »CL0:irc»CL1:,
etc.   This way a few guys became »CL3:"bad
wolves"»CL1: and the »CL6:Eurochart»CL1: editors were
treated  as  the »CL0:innocent»CL1: and »CL0:attacked»CL1:
"little  red  riding-hood".   Brrr, it
was  »CL0:terrible»CL1:.  A lot of articles, bad
words  about  it,  mainly generated by
the  sick  »CL2:Punisher»CL1: who wants to be on
everyone's  lips  no matter the costs.
I  was  »CL0:surprised»CL1: reading that I`m the
»CL0:bloody»CL1:  leader  of  it, like I want to
»CL0:destroy»CL1:  the scene, make »CL0:conflicts»CL1: and
many  more bad things.  I just want to
ask   you   guys   (and   mainly  you,
»CL2:Punisher»CL1:) a question:

»CL0:Are you out of your fucking mind?»CL1:

Noone  asked  me  »CL0:personally »CL1:about it.
Noone wants to know the »CL0:truth»CL1: and none
of  the »CL6: Eurochart »CL1:editors asked about
the  truth.   No  official»CL0:  statement»CL1:,
just  a bunch of»CL0: gossips»CL1: from mouth to
mouth.    Isn`t  it  »CL0:unfair »CL1: to  judge
someone  without  any proofs?  I think
it`s  »CL0:stupid»CL1:  but  as  long as I don`t
care  about  this  i`m taking »CL0:happy»CL1: in
the  scene.   Accusing  me  of being a
p»CL0:rovocator»CL1:  -  how  and »CL0:why»CL1:?  Did I do
something  »CL0:wrong»CL1:?   Whenever I support
»CL0:foreign»CL1:  magazines,  I  always want to
show  you  a  different point of view,
not the same like guys from »CL0:#amigascne»CL1:
and other so called "western sceners".
I`m   a  »CL0:Pole»CL1:,  i`m  from  »CL0:Poland»CL1:  and
(surprisingly)  think  like  a »CL0: polish»CL1:
scener.   I`m  a  dinosaur  who  still
enjoys »CL0: swapping »CL1: in  2001 (five years
after it was officially announced»CL0: dead»CL1:
in  other  countries).   I still go to
parties  and  not just »CL0:polish»CL1: ones.  I
want  to  organise  a  small  lobby of
polish alike sceneing.  Those guys who
attend  polish parties or meetings are
»CL0:surprised»CL1:   -  no  net,  not  so  many
computers  -  just  guys  who...  have
»CL0:fun»CL1:.   And  as  I  read  more and more
articles    in    international   disk
magazines  I  think that other sceners
are   getting   »CL0:jealeous»CL1:.    A  little
jealeous because we (Poles) still have
the  »CL0:enthusiasm»CL1:,  still having as much
»CL0:fun»CL1:  as  we  can  as »CL0:demosceners»CL1:.  The
enthusiasm  on  the  western  scene is
getting »CL0: smaller»CL1:  year  by year - less
and  less  »CL0:productions»CL1:, so few»CL0: quality»CL1:
sceners  and  very  limited  »CL0:knowledge»CL1:
about   nowadays  scene  in  magazines
(please   take  a  look  at  my  other
article  included  in  this  issue  of
»CL6:Eurochart»CL1:,  too).  The »CL0:truth»CL1: is hard -
there  are  some  guys  like  Wade who
simply  hate everything that is polish
-   sceners,   productions  and  other
aspects.   The only words I can say to
Wade  is  "fuck you idiot" but I don`t
want   to   do  it.   It`s  better  to
organise  a  small lobby that presents
to   you   guys  that  poles  are  not
junglers.   We are just like »CL0:you»CL1:, only
five-six years ago...

»CL1:--------------------------------------
    »CL0:     A miracle happened?
»CL1:--------------------------------------

Yes,  a miracle happened, because time
»CL0:stopped»CL1:   here  in  Poland  and  other
Mid-European  countries.  When we read
about  your bigger and bigger parties,
network  and thousands of attenders we
felt »CL0:sick»CL1: because the biggest party in
Poland   contains  about  thousand  of
attenders  and has no net and hundreds
of   computers.   And  then  something
became true.  We saw the other side of
the  medal  -  the  »CL0:dark side»CL1:.  »CL0:95%»CL1: of
party  attenders  are  totally »CL0: lamers»CL1:
and/or »CL0:porn traders»CL1:.  There is no such
fun  like on polish parties.  The only
excepection   is  »CL6: Boozembly»CL1:  which  I
respect  deeply  and I want to be »CL0:rich»CL1:
enough  to  attend  it  sometime.  The
poles  spotted  a cancer that »CL0:eats»CL1: the
western  scene  and  started  to »CL0:think»CL1:
about  it.   And noone wants to »CL0:import»CL1:
this cancer to our country.  So like a
»CL0:miracle»CL1:,  time  »CL0:stopped »CL1: and  we don`t
want  to  have a big parties where you
are  number  who  only  »CL0:pay  money»CL1: and
transfer »CL0:  adult   materials»CL1:.   Polish
parties    are    »CL0:personal»CL1:,   like   a
»CL0:family-reunion»CL1:.   Beside parties there
are  a lot of »CL0:meetings»CL1: that attracts a
few  good,  old  and  well-known scene
»CL0:friends»CL1:.   Last  year I attended seven
parties  and almost fifteen meetings -
how many did you attend?  Much less, I
»CL1:think......

We  all  know  that  parties  are very
»CL0:important »CL1: for  sceners and 90% of the
poles  are  having »CL0:fun»CL1: at parties.  We
live  from  one  c-party  to  another,
working on new productions and want to
be  »CL0:recognised »CL1:and»CL0: remembered»CL1: by other
sceners.  The foreign scene was deeply
respected  in  Poland until 1995-1996.
Then  poles  saw  the  cancer and said
"hey,  we  have  »CL0:skills»CL1: like them" and
respect  became  a »CL0:competition»CL1:..  It`s
not a secret that guys like »CL2:Wade»CL1: don`t
accept  it,  but I don`t have any idea
of what to do about this.  We can only
keep  ignoring  these »CL2:Wade»CL1:-»CL3:"types"»CL1: and
keep  working  on  »CL3:"cursing"»CL1:  you guys
with  our »CL0:enthusiasm»CL1: and»CL0: fun»CL1:.  Now you
can  learn  from us like poles used to
learn from you until 1996...

That`s  all,  folks.  I deeply respect
those   who  still  wants  to  »CL0:release»CL1:
something but please don`t force me to
accept the quality of foreign releases
nowadays.   I think Poles can beat you
in  every  single  way  except for the
Ephidrena  guys  (»CL0:respects»CL1:)  but  they
start  to  remix  their older releases
more  and  more  (like »CL6:"j"»CL1: which still
deserves  the first place on »CL6:The Party»CL1:
because   there  was  no  »CL0:competition»CL1:,
really).    When  I  take  a  look  at
releases   like  »CL2: Haujobb`s»CL1:  »CL6:"Megademo
2000" »CL1: I  want to kill myself.  It`s a
shame to show this Amiga production to
anybody  and I`m not the only one with
this  »CL0:opinion»CL1:.   From  the  other side
noone consider »CL6:"Metatag lock k-231277"»CL1:
as  a good production and vote for it.
This  is  crazy because our production
beats »CL2:Haujobb»CL1: »CL6:"Megademo 2000"»CL1: in every
single  detail  (except  »CL0:longness»CL1:  and
»CL0:boringness»CL1:).   It`s  only  one »CL0:example»CL1:
but if you dig some more, you can find
more  "pearls" like this.  And this is
why  we  are  »CL0:different»CL1: and not always
have one view..

And if we`re still in the »CL0:jungle»CL1:, then
where are you?  I`m »CL0:disgusted»CL1:..
