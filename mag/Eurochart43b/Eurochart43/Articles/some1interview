»CL0:              "I really can't compose music myself, I'm officially
»CL0:                           crap in composing!" - »CL2:Some1»CL1:

»CL2:Darkus:»CL0:   Firstly,  tell »CL6:The Eurochart »CL1:readers something about the person behind
the »CL0:handle»CL1: »CL2:Some1»CL1:.

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   Well,  actually  I  don't use the handle »CL2:Some1»CL1: anylonger.  Nowadays I'm
just  »CL0:"Mikael  Fyrek"»CL1:  I'm »CL0:24»CL1: years old, living in »CL0:Stockholm»CL1: (capital of»CL0: Sweden»CL1:)
with  my  »CL0:girlfriend»CL1: (whom I'm also »CL0:engaged»CL1: with).  I've been involved in the »CL0:IT»CL1:
business  quite  a  while now, although I've just »CL0:resigned»CL1:, hence I'm »CL0:unemployed»CL1:
(never underestimate the »CL0:power »CL1:of »CL0:unemployment»CL1: :-D)

»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:   For  those  who  don`t »CL0: remember»CL1: you, can you tell us about your »CL0:past»CL1:?
What »CL0:year»CL1: was it you started the Amiga scene?





















»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   Oh,  that's a »CL0:tricky»CL1: one.  Can't remember the »CL0:exact»CL1: year, but I suppose
it  was  sometime  around  »CL0:1990»CL1:.   I started out with a couple of»CL0: friends»CL1: and we
actually  released  some  sort  of  a »CL0: demo»CL1:  with me composing the »CL0:music»CL1: for it.
(luckily  with another »CL0:handle»CL1: :-D).  From here, it took a really long »CL0:time»CL1: until
I got »CL0:infamous»CL1:.

»CL2:Darkus: »CL1:  It`s  true you have been a member of some »CL0:legendary»CL1: groups through the
years, can you run us through them?

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:  Well, »CL2:Mangoo »CL1:should be the »CL0:most»CL1: famous group that I've been in (check it
out  :   »CL0:www.mangoo.com»CL1:  )  furthermore,  we've  got  groups like »CL2:Poise»CL1:, »CL2:Rebels»CL1:,
»CL2:Razor1911»CL1:  (where  my  function was:  »CL0:swapper»CL1:) and so on, and so forth.  And oh,
just to take the piss out of some Danes, »CL2:Scoopex»CL1: as well :-D

»CL2:Darkus: »CL1:  Yeah»CL2: Mangoo»CL1: is one to remember, so around what year was it you finally
decided to »CL0:drop»CL1: the Amiga scene?

»CL2:Some1: »CL1:  As  I've  stated before my »CL0:opinion»CL1: is that the Amigascene died when »CL0:AGA»CL1:
came,  but  honestly I dropped out around »CL0:95-96»CL1:, I think.  But then again, there
still  came some productions with our (me and»CL2: Morrow»CL1:) music in it.  But that was




















just »CL0:old»CL1: music that we had composed.

»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:  Throughout your time in the scene, it`s noticable you produced music as
a  »CL0:duo»CL1:  with  a number of people.  »CL2:Prime»CL1:, »CL2:Lizardking»CL1: and »CL2:Morrow»CL1:.  Why was it you
made so many modules as a duo with someone else?

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   That's an easy question to answer, because I really can't compose music
myself.   I'm  officially »CL0:crap»CL1: in composing.  So, to make a »CL0:name»CL1: on the scene, I
had  only one option:  to let a »CL0:friend»CL1: compose a lot of tunes, and state that we
were  a  »CL0:duo»CL1:  (I  had to pay a lot of money to these guys though, but hey, I was
prepared to make a »CL0:sacrifice»CL1:).
                               
»CL2:Darkus: »CL1:  Do  you still have any »CL0:ties»CL1: or »CL0:interest»CL1: in the Amiga scene today?  You
have been seen in »CL0:#amigascne»CL1: IRC channel recently.

»CL2:Some1:  »CL1: Oh  yes,  I usually go to »CL0:#amigascne»CL1: on »CL0:IRC»CL1:, whenever I'm online.  It's
quite  sad, but that's one of the few places to go when searching for »CL0:reasonable»CL1:
people on the net.  (and to practise on my »CL0:Finnish»CL1:..) But I think that's it.






















»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:   I  understand  »CL0:music»CL1:  plays  a  large part of your life, are you still
composing?

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:  But of course.  I never »CL0:stopped»CL1: composing, I just changed »CL0:platforms»CL1: (you
should  know  this  Lee  :-D)  Btw, what did you grab to eat?  I found this nice
»CLC:ice-cream»CL1: in the fridge :-D

»CL2:Darkus: »CL1:  I  ate a large bowl of »CLC:rice pudding»CL1:..  mmmm..  with »CL0:sugar»CL1: on the top..
mmmm..

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:  Jummey!

»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:  Whats your »CL0:future»CL1: plans?  Are you attempting to seal any »CL0:record deals»CL1:?

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   Well,  I've  got no "big" plans for the future, until today.  I've just
been »CL0: composing»CL1: for »CL3:"myself"»CL1:.  My intuition tells me that most of the time (with
a  few  exceptions), it's quite hard to get a record deal with music composed on
»CL0:Fasttracker»CL1:.   What  I've  heard,  there's  just  a couple of examples of people
composing  that »CL0: techno»CL1:  stuff  who's  been  signed  (but then again, I might be
wrong?).   Anyway,  I'm  currently  having  »CL0:discussions»CL1: with two labels about my




















music, but I don't have that »CL0:high hopes»CL1: about it.

»CL2:Darkus:  »CL1: Are  any  of  your more recent songs »CL0:online»CL1:?  Where could one»CL0: download»CL1:
them?

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   I'm currently releasing a couple of tunes for »CL2:Fairlight Music»CL1: every now
and then (»CL0:www.fairlightmusic.co.uk»CL1:).  But then again, there is a limited account
of  tunes  that they can handle and release, so you've just got to say:  »CL3:"pretty
please"»CL1: :-D

»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:   Back to the topic of your »CL0:scene»CL1: career, what would you say is you most
»CL0:memorable»CL1: moment?

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   Autch,  that's  a  hard  one.   I  think  that would've been our little
»CL2:Razor1911»CL1:  meeting  (I  »CL0:think»CL1:  it  was  »CL2:Razor1911»CL1:) back in the old days.  Me and
»CL2:Lizardking»CL1: produced a chipmusicdisc called »CL6:"Doskpop"»CL1: Those were the days, need I
say that most of the tunes were made during »CL0:alcohol»CL1: consumtion :-D

»CL2:Darkus:  »CL1: Would  it  be  safe  to  say you »CL0:miss»CL1: those old times?  Or more to the
point, do you miss the »CL0:scene»CL1:?




















»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   No, not the scene really but the »CL0:innocent»CL1: times.  To be honest, I never
paid  THAT  much  »CL0:attention»CL1: to the scene, demos and stuff.  It was mostly »CL2:Morrow»CL1:
and »CL2:Prime»CL1: who kept me informed of what was happening :-D I was more into meeting
all  the  people of the scene.  I mean, people from all over world »CL0:traveled»CL1:, and
»CL0:met»CL1:  eachother  at  these  partys,  and  everyone  was happy you can't find this
anywhere else.  (although I've heard that this has »CL0:changed»CL1: now :-D)

»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:   Yeah  much has changed now, but still looking back, which »CL0:musicians»CL1: do
you think ruled supreme?

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:  Wow, there were so many.  »CL0:All»CL1: of the musicians deserve respect composing
on  just »CL0: 4 channels»CL1:, looking back at that fact just astounds me!  But one of my
all time favorite musiciand is/was »CL2:Heatbeat»CL1:.

»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:   Do  you  still  have  your »CL0:Amiga»CL1:?  Maybe locked away in some old dusty
»CL0:cupboard»CL1:?

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   Actually,  I don't know.  I've»CL0: moved»CL1: so many times and the last time we
moved  (me and my girlfriend), I just couldn't seem to find no amiga.  (I'm sure
it's still »CL0:somewhere»CL1: though).  But I still have my old amiga »CL0:monitor»CL1:, that's for




















sure :-D

»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:   Would  there by any chance in the near future, of you making another »CL0:4
channel»CL1: module?

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   Nope, or..  Well, I don't think so.  But you never know, someday I just
might  start  to wonder how it was to compose with just »CL0:4 channels »CL1:and might try
that out, once again.

»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:   Moving  toward  the  end, do you think the scene has had any effect on
your life?

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   Of  course,  but  hey  let  »CL0:me»CL1: ask a couple of questions now.  Tell The
»CL6:Eurochart»CL1: readers how we met the first time.

»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:  Erm, I can`t remember how we first met?  :)

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   Hehe, come up with something then!  :-D (you approached me on mirc »CL0:DEAD
DRUNK»CL1: and asked if I wanted to join »CL2:Poise»CL1:..  hehe)





















»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:   Well  the  very first time we met, was at my local »CL0:"help for slippers"»CL1:
club, we seemed to be going through the same problem and understood each other..
am I right?

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   But  of  course my friend, but what the »CL6:Eurochart»CL1: readers would like to
know is, if this meeting of ours has somehow »CL0:changed»CL1: your »CL0:life»CL1:?

»CL2:Darkus: »CL1:  It  did, it made me »CL0:realize»CL1: my main purpose in life for the previous 2
years was a »CL0:bag carrier»CL1:.  Now I understand there is more to life, like »CL0:babies»CL1: :)

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   Yes  Lee,  we  both had been experiencing some major problems with »CL0:"bag
carrying"»CL1:  (carry your »CL0:girlfriends»CL1: bags when she's shopping) That institute made
us  really »CL0: understand»CL1:  the true meaning of life, didn't it?  :-D Let's move on.
There's  been  a  quite  wild discussion in »CL0:#amigascne»CL1: lately, about that »CL2:Mangoo»CL1:
never released anything.  Comments on that?

»CL2:Darkus: »CL1:  Well  I  can  say  »CL2:Mangoo»CL1:  released  many things, maybe no-one saw the
productions..   or  maybe people »CL0:forgot»CL1: they had seen them?  Or I can say »CL2:Mangoo»CL1:
never  released  anything  because  I`m  a lazy »CL0:organiser»CL1:?  I`ll let the »CL0:readers»CL1:
decide the real answer :)




















»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   Yes,  let  the »CL0:readers»CL1: decide.  Now, as rumours state you recently »CL0:quit»CL1:
the  scene.   What  are  your future plans?  (except the basic stuff as carrying
bags  and such?) And why did you make the »CL0:decision»CL1: to quit?  (another example of
beeing a »CL0:slipper»CL1:?)

»CL2:Darkus: »CL1:  Well  I  guess  I  wanted  to  take a step »CL0:back»CL1:, however saying that I
decided  to  continue  writing  »CL0:articles»CL1:  but really I wanted to spend more time
doing  »CL0:family »CL1: things and like you said generally being a »CL0:slipper»CL1: on a full-time
basis.

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:   Well,  we're  running  out of time mr.Lee.  Thank you for your precious
time and I wish you »CL0:good luck»CL1: with your future as a »CL0:family slipper»CL1:.

»CL2:Darkus:»CL1:   No,  thank  »CL0:you»CL1:  for  »CL0:your»CL1: time I look forward to parts »CL0:2»CL1: and »CL0:3»CL1: of the
interview  :)  Well I`m sure our future as »CL0:slippers»CL1: will surely keep bringing us
together :)

»CL2:Some1:»CL1:  »CL0:Amen»CL1:
