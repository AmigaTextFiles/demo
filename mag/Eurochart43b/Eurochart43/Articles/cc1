»CL1:
Yes,  another  »CL0:Eurochart »CL1:with hundreds
of  interesting articles and thousands
of  votes  gathered  by  our  staff of
ever-so-trustworthy    votecollectors.
Or   not.    Well,   whatever,  here's
another   »CL0:Coder's   Corner »CL1:  for  your
enjoyment.

It's  nice  to  see  that  people have
found  many  interesting  uses for the
»CL0:Coder's  Corner »CL1: in  issue  42  of the
»CL0:Official  Eurochart. »CL1: »CL2: Psycho/Loonies, »CL1:
for  example,  discovered that quoting
half  a  sentence  out of context in a
demo  provokes  an  applause  from the
»CL0:Mekka-Symposium »CL1: compo  audience.  The
»CL2:TBL »CL1: coders  found  that  ignoring  it
altogether  and  not  even coding your
effects  is an even better way to make
people  worship  you.  »CL2:Potion »CL1:probably
read  it,  concluded  they couldn't be
bothered   to   optimize   their  code
anymore,  then  released  a  »CL0:PPC»CL1: intro
which (of course) won the compo.

It  seems  that  coders  are  becoming
increasingly     opportunistic     and
inconsiderate   in  their  efforts  to
achieve    fame,   glory   and   (most
importantly?)    »CL3: prizemoney. »CL1:    They
casually   make   such  statements  as
»CL2:Loonies'»CL1: »CL3: "Amiga=68060" »CL1: because  they
know  that's  what  a  lot of the less
informed  Amiga  sceners would like to
think.   What  Loonies really meant by
that  is »CL3:"Amiga=My Amiga", »CL1:because the
»CL1:demo  wouldn't  run on an »CL0:060-equipped
A1200 »CL1:without being "forced" to do so.
Why?    Because  they  also  made  the
rather  bold statement that »CL3:"Demos are
meant  to  be  oneframe"»CL1:,  which meant
their  demo  was only really a "demo",
as    they    defined   it,   on   the
considerably  faster  »CL0:A4000»CL1: CPU boards
(on  the  »CL0:A1260»CL1:,  many  of the effects
don't  achieve  50 fps).  They finally
solved  the  problem  by  releasing  a
»CL3:"complete" »CL1:   version   which   merely
shrinks the display window on »CL0:A1200s»CL1:.

A  demo that only really looks the way
it's  supposed  to on the »CL0:very fastest»CL1:
of  Amiga  hardware solutions is not a
demo   for   the  masses.   It's  also
striking   how   many  groups  release
»CL3:"party"»CL1: versions of their productions,
ie.   »CL0: unfinished »CL1:  versions,   simply
because   releasing   at  a  party  is
»CL0:paramount »CL1: and  waiting  a  few months
until   the   next   major   event  is
»CL3:completely  out of the question.»CL1:  They
need  attention (and prizemoney?) now,
not tomorrow.

This  is  exploiting every opportunity
without  regard  for actual »CL0:quality»CL1: or
»CL0:personal  integrity»CL1:,  and it's killing
the   scene   (okay,   so  just  about
everything  is  killing the scene, but
hey).

»CL0:Musicians »CL1: do  it  too;  work in music
styles they don't really »CL0:feel »CL1:anything
for  but  they know the party audience
will  prefer.   »CL0:Graphicians»CL1: compromise
the  »CL0:artistic  value»CL1: of their pictures
by        continuously       selecting
»CL0:crowdpleasing »CL1: motifs such as scarcely
clad  females,  while they often admit
they  would've  rather drawn something
»CL0:original »CL1:  and »CL0: fresh »CL1: but  feared  it
wouldn't  sit  well with the audience.
Is this »CL4:art»CL1:?

I  think  in  the  end »CL0: coders»CL1: are the
worst  though.   Maybe it's because »CL0:PC
sceners »CL1:are hard to impress, and after
all  it  all  comes  down  to how many
»CL0:votes »CL1:you get, right?  I think we have
to  ask  ourselves some very important
questions:   What  happened  to »CL0:honour
and   integrity»CL1:?   Is  a  demo  really
impressive   just   because  it  »CL0:LOOKS»CL1:
impressive?   Is  a  demo  more than a
»CL0:multimedia   presentation»CL1:?   What's  a
»CL0:prize»CL1:  worth  if  you have to cheat in
order to win it?

We  should  have ready answers for all
of  those questions and more along the
same lines, and the fact that we don't
hints  at  a really sad tendency among
coders.
