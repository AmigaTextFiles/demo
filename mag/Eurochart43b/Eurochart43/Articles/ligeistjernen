It   has   always   been   an  ongoing
»CL0:discussion»CL1:   in   the  scene,  whether
charts  are  supposed  to  reflect the
»CL0:current»CL1:  scene, or whether they should
be  »CL0:all  inclusive»CL1:,  from the start of
the scene in  »CL0:86»CL1: and until the present
time.   This  debate  is  quite old, I
think  it  started to spring up in 93'
already, where some »CL0:dissenters»CL1: thought
it  was  hard getting onto the charts,
and  »CL0:questioning»CL1:  whether »CL2:Delta»CL1: should
really  be  on  the coder chart.  Some
charts  have chosen to restrict voting
to  newer  groups,  »CL6:Showtime»CL1: did that,
while the »CL6:EC»CL1: has always held itself to





be  an alltime scene chart.  But every
now and again, the debate pops up, and
some  sceners  ask  why  we don't do a
more actual chart, also to give a »CL0:clap»CL1:
on  the »CL0:shoulder»CL1: of the active groups,
who  might  not get very highly ranked
due  to old, legendary and »CL0:dead»CL1: groups
still    sitting    there.     Roughly
speaking,  it seems like the west, and
particularely  older  sceners  in  the
west,  »CL0:prefer»CL1:  the  all  time  charts,
while newer sceners and aprox.  all of
»CL0:Poland»CL1:,  prefer the more actual way of
doing charts.

Those  older  sceners  are  accused of
living  in  the»CL0:  past»CL1:  and denying the
»CL0:present»CL1:, which is here and now, voting
for»CL0: dead»CL1: groups instead of recognizing
and respecting the work of the actual,
»CL0:living»CL1:  groups.   These  oldfashioned,
overly  nostalgic  sceners simply vote
for  what  they thought best when they
were  in  their  scenish  prime  so to
speak, and everything that comes after
that,  seems  simply to be not as good
as the old productions.

That  is  true of course, I find a lot
evidence of this behavior when talking
with  sceners  and  looking  at votes.
Somehow  the  past  productions, those
around  91'-93', and for 'newer' older
sceners,  those from 96'-97' just seem
to  get  a  lot of votes and are still
remembered   fondly.    In   this  »CL6:EC»CL1:,
although  I  dare  to say that we have
almost  not  had  ANY vote from an ex.
scener,  you  can  still  find the old
legendary   productions   and  sceners
represented,  proving that some people
vote  for  that which did most »CL0:impress»CL1:
them,  overall,  looking  at  all  the
years  they've  been in the scene, not
only  for  the  releases of the past 2
years.    As   stated,  feelings  over
whether  this is »CL0:fair»CL1: or not is kinda'
»CL0:divided»CL1:, as it has always been.

In  »CL6:Devotion»CL1:,  they lament over people
such   as  »CL2:The  Spy »CL1: and»CL2:  Chaos»CL1:  going
farther  and  farther »CL0:down»CL1: the charts,
while  newcomers without as much skill
or    engagement   get   much   »CL0:higher»CL1:
placements,  while  (that is my guess)
in  »CL2: Taboo»CL1:   and  »CL2: Excess»CL1:,  they'd  be
complaining  about what the hell those
old  farts  were  still  doing  on the
chart.   Two  different  opinions, two
different   »CL0:worldviews »CL1:  infact.   One
thinks  that  every release and scener
is  to be judged »CL0:equally»CL1:, for his time
in  the scene, and what he contributed
with,  regardless  of  time, while the
other  thinks  we  should  have »CL0:active»CL1:
charts, with the people who are »CL0:active»CL1:
now  on  them,  and  not the people of
»CL1:yesteryear,»CL1:   who  contribute  nothing
more  to  the  scene, and only clutter
the  chart  for »CL0: younger »CL1: sceners, who
could get more »CL0:motivated»CL1: if their name
got  on  the  chart.  Was it up to me,
I'd  be  happy to make »CL0:two»CL1: charts,  an
alltime  one,  and  a more recent one,
since I  do not count votes.  However,
not  to  scare  »CL2:Cytron»CL1:..   This  could
never   be   done,  because  you,  the
»CL0:sceners»CL1:,  are really, really hard »CL0:nuts»CL1:
to  crack, regarding collecting votes,
I  think  around 4-5 people out of »CL0:100»CL1:
fill  in  their  votesheet »CL0:completely»CL1:.
Imagine   how   it   would   be   with
effectively »CL0:  double »CL1:  the  amount  of
categories  that  needed to be filled!
No,   this   solution   is   just  not
»CL0:feasible»CL1:.

Since  the  last  »CL6:EC»CL1: I have been asked
quite  many  times, whether I couldn't
restrict voting to »CL0:active»CL1: people only.
Now, it is quite understandable I hear
this remark often, if »CL2:Lord Helmet»CL1:,»CL2: Mop»CL1:
and »CL2: Wolfman»CL1:  were  above  me  on  the
editor  chart, I must admit I would be
quite »CL0:tempted»CL1: to ask a chart about the
same  thing,  hoping  to  eliminate my
»CL0:competition»CL1:,  which  I  would  frankly
never be able to top myself, if people
kept  voting for what all time editors
they  thought  best  (well,  one could
always  hope  those  pesky, irritating
oldfashioned  sceners  who  voted  for
these   people  »CL0:died  out»CL1:,  sooner  or
later,  heh).  So, I think most people
ask  me  this because they want to get
higher  on  the charts »CL0:themselves»CL1:, and
want    those    »CL0:hindrances »CL1:  removed.
However,   voting   only   for  active
people,  but still voting for all time
productions  would  be  a  bit  »CL0:queer»CL1:,
better to vote in the same way for all
chart entries.

Some  have  said  that we could have a
»CL3:'all   time  best  production'»CL1:  chart,
aswell  as  an  »CL3:'all time best scener'»CL1:
chart,  so  that we only get »CL0:two»CL1: extra
charts for people to fill, and we also
gain  a  place  in  the  chart for the
older   stuff.    This  is  quite  the
sensible   and  »CL0: diplomatic»CL1:  approach,
trying   to   accomodate »CL0: both»CL1:  views.
There's some problems of course, since
»CL0:musicdisks»CL1:  would  get  mixed  up with
»CL0:demos»CL1:,  and  unable  to  compete  with
them,  I'd  wager,  so  that  we'd get
msotly  »CL0:demos»CL1:  on that chart.  And who
is  to  judge  whether  »CL2:Jester»CL1:  was  a
better/more skilled scener that »CL2:Chaos»CL1:,
for    instance.    Mixing   different
categories   create   these  problems.
However, we'd like your views on this,
maybe  you  have  some  special way of
handling  it,  making »CL0:everybody»CL1: happy,
that we have overlooked, and we'd also
like  to hear what the »CL0:majority»CL1: of the
scene  actually  thinks about this, so
this  article  is made so that you can
»CL0:engage »CL1: yourself in this question, and
take part in the future development of
the  »CL6:EC»CL1:..   Uhh,  in  part, because of
course  we'll still do exactly what we
»CL0:want»CL1:,    we're   not   an  »CL0: impartial»CL1:,
»CL0:democratic»CL1: outlet for the whole scene,
the »CL6: EC»CL1:  is  produced for the scen, by
sceners   with   their  own »CL0: opinions»CL1:.
Opinions  can  be swayed by »CL0:reason»CL1: and
»CL0:suggestions»CL1:  though,  so feedback here
is  appreciated,  if you think we have
to  do  something  about  the  current
state of affairs.

Personally,   I  hold  myself  to  the
oldtimer  view.   Naturally the charts
are  ALL  TIME  charts, it is too»CL0: easy»CL1:
for  those not-so-very talented people
to  get  high  in the chart, if it was
only    for   »CL0: recent»CL1:    achievements.
Practically  everybody  in  the  scene
would  be on a chart then, it's almost
the state of affairs today.  If we did
it that way, no.  20 on the graphician
chart  would be a retarded »CL0:5 year old»CL1:,
drawing  white  lines  on  black  in a
random pattern via his mouse I think..
If  you  get  my point..  On the other
hand, of course active sceners have to
be  »CL0:encouraged »CL1: and»CL0: motivated»CL1:, and the
getting a good placement on a chart is
a  good way to do this.  However, this
argument  can't be used to get the old
people »CL0: off»CL1: the chart, because 1) look
at  the  charts.  Legendary people and
productions  are  there,  but they are
»CL0:spread  out»CL1:,  and the 3 leading people
of all charts are mostly all active in
the  scene  now,  so it is possible to
surpass the old legends (mostly not in
skill,  but people forget »CL0:achievements»CL1:
so  fast,  sadly..).  Which means that
yes, new talents will be »CL0:encouraged»CL1: by
being  on  the chart, but they will be
more »CL0: encouraged»CL1: if they actually have
to »CL0: fight»CL1:  for  it,  and try to garner
enough popularity first.  With the old
legends in the charts, there's atleast
a  little  bit of fighting, what's the
motivation if the charts were so small
that  everyone could get on them, just
by doing »CL0:something»CL1:?  The charts should
recognize  »CL0:true  talent»CL1:,  whether that
talent  is  10  years old, or a month.
That  is  the  purpose  of  the  »CL6:EC»CL1: at
least,  to  credit  and remember those
sceners  who  have  had  the  greatest
impact  on  the  scene,  regardless of
»CL0:age»CL1:.   Of  course people who know they
are  not  good  enough  for  competing
there, or who want to get higher up on
the  chart  would  like to see all the
hindrances  for  this  go, but that is
too  »CL0:cheap»CL1: a way to get recognized.  A
little   fighting  spirit  and  talent
should be needed too.

Realistically  though, people vote for
what   they  want,  and  thus  the  »CL6:EC»CL1:
reflects  »CL0:that»CL1:  right now.  Although I
personally  do  not think any musician
today  is  as skilled as »CL2:4mat»CL1:,»CL2: Jester»CL1:,
»CL2:Scott»CL1:, etc., we don't see these people
on  the top spots, and infact they are
slowly   »CL0:fading»CL1:  out  of  the  charts,
simply  because  sceners  are  not old
enough  to have been sceners when they
were  »CL0:active.»CL1:   So,  this  problem  is
infact only a pseudo-problem for those
wanting us to have recent charts only,
over  time,  the  old  ones  will fade
completely.    Of   course,   the  new
generation  of  sceners  who will hang
on,  will  keep  on  voting  for  what
impressed them today, so that, 6 years
from  now,  a  scener  who entered the
scene  last year, would still vote for
e.g. »CL2: Loonies»CL1: or»CL2: Ephidrena»CL1: stuff...
