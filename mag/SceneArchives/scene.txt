                     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

                        Written By: Tony Hasselbacher

    Welcome to "Scene Archives Search Utility" (now refered to as SASU).. 

IMPORTANT: if you want DMS to extract from CD #3, you HAVE to type in the
following:-
    
        assign Scene3: "Scene Archives 3:"
    
Sorry for this, but the CD was not named good :(.. 

What is SASU?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    Well, basically, SASU will help you to locate any item that you are after.
Simply  type  in  a  keyword  (ie,  a Demo Name, or Group Name, or even a Disk
Number!),  and  the  program  will  search  and  find any relating data.  Then
double-click  on  the required item, and if you have any of The Scene Archives
handy, it'll try to find the file you are after, and you'll be able to extract
that  item to disk (if it is a DMS), or else to a directory on your Hard Drive
(if it is a LZX file).  There is also some information on the demo presented.


Installing:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    I  recommend that you should just copy SASU to a directory on your HD.  So
then  it  is  easily  accessible.   Just  copy  these  files  to  your HD on a
directory:-

            Scene
            Scene.info
            scene.data1
            scene.data2

    Also  you  might  have  to  install  the new version of NList.mcc, as this
program  was written for v0.85.  It is included on this CD.  Also this program
was written under MUI v3.8.


Options
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    There are 2 Search Options, and they Are:-

        Search Criteria: What field do you want to search under ? 
                            - Demo Name  = Searchs only for the Name.
                            - Group Name = Searchs only for that Groups Prods.
                            - Disk Num.  = See What is on a Specific Disk.
                            - Demo+Group = Search for Demo and Group Names

        Search Options:  What type of Sort?
                            - Full       = Will search for ever occurence of
                                           the specified Keyword.
                            - Simple     = This just looks for the Keyword 
                                           only.
                            - Range Search = This is a special search that
                                             will show everything that is 
                                             in a certain Range of Disks.

To Use Range Search
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    The way you use the Range Search is like this.. 
    1 - Make sure that the Disk Nuber is selected in the Search Criteria
        Section.
    2 - In the Keyword, type in the two numbers you want to search for. For
        Example. if you want to find out what is between Disks #7566 and Disk 
        #7600, somply type "7566 7600" in the Search Keyword (of course with
        out the "'s!!).. For another example, type the following :-
                    4534 4765 
        in the Search Keyword entry, and then see what happens..
    3 - And press Search.


Updates:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    SASU  will  be regularily updated.  All the updates will appear on Aminet.

What are the Scene Archives?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    The  Scene  Archives  is  a massive collection of Amiga Scene Productions,
currently  it  spans  Eleven  CD's,  with  around  1000 disks on each CD..  So
basically  10440  disks  are  currently  in the Set.  I hope to have The Scene
Archives #12 out at around Christmas 2001.

    If   you   want   to   get   the  Scene  Archives,  please  E-Mail  me  at

SASU History
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
v1.09:  [24 Feb 2001]
        - There are now 16933 Entries
        - Fixed a nasty Bug when you Searched under "All" , it would display a
          lot of garbage in the list.  
        - Changed the All Search so it ONLY Searches for demo and Group. And
          also changed the Label for this Button.
        - Got rid of the pesky CD requestor, so that if SASU sees the Needed
          CD already mounted onto the system, it will automatically look for
          the file.  If the CD is not mounted in the system, it will then
          prompt for the required CD.
        - Now has prober inplementation of disks that are over the 10000
          number.
        - Added so that CD #11 is working in SASU.
