»CL4: Black Dragon/Honoo & Limited Edition

»CL0:Yes, Black Dragon is back with another
illogical article! Then you have only
2 choices!! The 1st one is to switch
off your Amiga and dance in the last
success of Gala! The 2nd choice is to
close your eyes and try to find out
who the girl is who has put her hands
in front of your eyes :) OK!! It's
time to start this article but 1st! I
want to thanks my family and all my
friends! (Hi Mum, Daddy, my sister and
brothers! I'm writing a article for a
mag! Incredible, isn't it?).

Well, this article is about the Amiga
parties! Then.... What's an Amiga
party? That's a good question!

So.... An Amiga is a computer and... A
party is a big hall full of crazy guys
;)

Stay calm! Everybody knows what an
Amiga party is with all its events and
fun! But can you think af an idea of a
new kind of Amiga party? One that will
be different and perhaps better?!

So! I've some ideas of new kind of
parties! My first idea is.... To
create a Universal party!

This idea comes from when I was
watching the Olympic Games on my Sony
TV! What a so cool idea to do the same
things as those Athletes! It will be a
great idea to create a party like the
Olympic Games! Just imagine the name:
THE DEMOLYMPIC PARTY!!

The subject will be to release the
most important party events every
fourth years! The events will be like
the ones at all common Parties: Demo,
Intro, Gfx, amd Music competitions!
But only 1 Demo for 1 Country!

Yes! Before the DEMOLYMPIC, each
country chooses it's best group that
will be the most active & talentous
one! Hard choice but it will be the
rules! About the intro compos: Same
thing as the demos except that the
group will not necessarilly be the
same!

The Gfx compos will be different... We
admit 5 graphicians for each country,
but each graphician must present 2
different kinds of Gfx for the compo
and also 1 realtime Gfx! What's a
realtime Gfx? It's of course a Gfx
done at the party place with a theme
and 5 phases of the work! Hard but it
will be the only way to have real
artists!

Another Gfx compo will be the paper
Gfx 1 Hour Compo! Only real paper
artist will be admitted!

The music compo will be like the
graphics compo but only 4 channels for
each competitor (with Protracker
only!).

2 different kinds of music for each
musician and also a realtime music
compo, but this one with only the same
samples for all the musicians! Each
musician will have a theme
(Rock,Techno or Classic!) and will use
the same samples!

The prices will be .... medals like on
the Olympic Games! 3 winners for gold,
silver or bronze! Nothing else or if
some sponsors will be there, those
sponsors will also give some prizes to
the winners and all the other
competitors!

The party place will be different
every 4th year! Of course... Other
competitions will be found for this
event but with the same rules as the
other compos! We never find 40 groups
of one country against 10 of another!
So... This is my 1st idea!

The 2nd idea is to create a party on
the internet world!!! Just imagine 1
or 2 millions of visitors for a
party!! The name of this party will
be: Party net show!!!

The best thing will be the entry price
of the party! TOTALLY FREE coz you
will stay at home! :)

The party will start with a web page
totally done by the organisers and on
it you will find all the events of a
normal party! The most important rules
of this party will be the time! Then
you will have only a short time to
release your project (Demo, Gfx,...)
and to put it on the party net page!
After this...Various guys selected all
around the World will be the jury and
the results will be really fast! The
prizes will be free internet access
for one year! ;)

A fast party on a too fast internet
world!

Well... Now you have some ideas for a
new kind of future for the Amiga
scene! Then... My last words will be:
Be positive! Time to go to bed! Tchao!
