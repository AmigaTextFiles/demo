                     If you think that
                     it is unfair that
                     a Depth member
                     has won the comp-
                     etition, remember
                     that it was not
                     possible for the
                     people in the
                     jury to vote for
                     themselves. Also,
                     you should try to
                     listen to the
                     modules, which
                     should be
spread along with the »CL1:Eurochart»
itself, either in the main archives or
in a separate archive spread at the
same time as the EC itself.
