»CL4:             by Sprocket

»CL0:In the last couple of years, »CL1:The Black
Lotus» has more or less dominated the
»CL1:Amiga» scene. For some strange reason,
this group has managed to gather some
of the scene's best coders, musicians
and graphicians. This is an interview
with two of the latter, namely »CL1:Danny»
and »CL1:Louie». These two guys have topped
the charts for quite a while now, and
it all climaxed when they released a
fantastic co-op picture at »CL1:The
Gathering 1997». What's their story?
How did they manage to come this far?
In this interview, the famous couple
will try to answer to some of the
questions, accusations and rumours
about themselves.

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Hello! I see you both have
       arrived safely, so I guess we
       can start the interview, then?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Sure.. I'm ready
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Well, I have to fix my hair!!!
       :)
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Oh.. Yeah, me too.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Hehe.. :)

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Ok, can you like.. Tell me
       about how you started? When did
       you enter the scene?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: You can start, Danny boy.
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Well, it started a while ago..
       I think I became a member of
       the amiga scene back in 1992,
       at the Prime '92 party.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Oh? Did you release anything at
       the party?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Yes. I drew a bunch of
       pictures, and we made a
       slideshow out of it.
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: I released my first picture at
       The Party 3.

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     A lot of the scene's
       graphicians are also very
       talented real-life artists.
       Have you always been interested
       in drawing, or could you just
       as well have ended up coding or
       making music?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Hehe.. Well let Danny speak first!
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: No, after you my friend.. :)
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: No, you start! :)
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Well.. No, I wasn't very good
       at drawing when I was a little
       kid. When I was about 6, I got
       sent back from kindergarten one
       day, to show my awful stuff at
       home! :)
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Well, you've come a long way
       since then, that's for sure..
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Yes, but it was a humiliating
       experience.. I've been wanting
       revenge ever since! ;) I
       actually wanted to be a
       musician when I was younger,
       because my father is one. I
       didn't have what it takes to
       become one, though, I couldn't
       play a note. A long time ago I
       even did some simple c64 basic
       programming. Assembly proved to
       be over my head, though... As
       the years passed, my drawing
       skills improved, and then I
       decided to start practising my
       favorite non-computer hobby on
       the computer aswell.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:    How about you, Louie? You seem
       like you've always been good at
       drawing?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Well, I started when I was 12,
       so I've been drawing for a
       while now.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Oh.. How old are you both, by
       the way?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: I am 19... :)
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: I am 23.
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Danny is an old man.. :)
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Louie is a young unexperienced
       lad.. ;)
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: OLD MAN!!! :D
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     :D

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Who inspired you in the
       beginning? :) You must have
       stolen some ideas, techniques
       etc?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Well, I've always liked Rob
       Ruppel..
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Fantasy art inspired me most.
       Then later along came the works
       of Disney and some famous older
       painters like Renoir, Monet,
       etc.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Oh.. So, who's Rob Ruppel?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: He's a painter from TSR, an
       American novel company.
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Yep, a fantasy-realistic type
       of artist.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Oh, I've never heard about him,
       but I've seen some pictures
       from Jeff Easley and Larry
       Elmore, for example.. I think
       they work for the same company?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Yes, it's the same company.
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: And there's Clyde Caldwell and
       Fred Fields.
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: And Burt Reynolds! 
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     BURT? :D
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: You know, "Smokey and the
       bandit", Black TransAm :D
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Oh, him.. :)

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Any scene graphicians you
       admired too?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Hmm.. At the time I thought
       Cougar was good.. and some
       others.. but I mostly liked
       non-scene art more.
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Cougar's trainpic in
       Interference made me shit my
       pants full when I saw it for the
       first time!
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Hehe.. And Facet, for example,
       was really poplular back then,
       wasn't he?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Yes. Facet and I used to have
       frequent telephone
       conversations on gfx those
       days, talking about ideas and
       techniques.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Oh, do you know him IRL?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Well.. I haven't spoken to him
       since The Party 5, but some
       years ago I knew him quite
       well, yes.

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     You two, then? Danny and Louie,
       I mean.. Are you good friends?
       Do you meet a lot in real life?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: I don't have a real life! :) I
       work to damn hard.. trying to
       find TPKs.. and pornos! :)
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Hahaha! Yes... Louie has a nose
       for finding porn! :) Well,
       Louie spent some days at my
       place in London a while back..
       sleeping on the floor, next to
       a noisy fridge! :) And we meet
       at parties of course.. Plus he
       promised that I could visit him
       in Sweden any time.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Ok.. Good thing you mentioned
       the floor, or else we'd have
       ourselves another Tip/Mantronix
       scandal! :D

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     But you obviously are so good
       friends that you co-operate
       well. Your tg97 pic.. Who made
       what? And how did you do it?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Well.. I'll let Louie answer
       that one.
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Oh.. thanks, but no thanks! :)
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     We all heard rumours about
       scanning and Photoshop..?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Well.. Louie and I will be
       publishing a nice little
       article about people who accuse
       us of using scanners.. since we
       both are quite fed up of being
       falsely accused..
       I started on the picture in
       Brilliance on the Amiga a long
       time ago, and left it half
       finished for months. Then about
       a week before the Gathering I
       knew I had to do a picture..
       but I also knew that I couldn't
       finish it on my own. I
       mentioned it to Rodney, and he
       said that Louie had the same
       problem, so Louie and I decided
       to finish the picture together.
       I told him what "look" I wanted
       (I even phoned him in sweden :)
       First we decided that we'd make
       it a 256 color pic, using only
       the Amiga, but since time
       pressured us and the thought of
       24bit colors was so tempting,
       we later decided to make it an
       800x600x24bit Photoshop
       picture.
       I had already begun working on
       the lady on the Amiga and sent
       a preview to Louie.
       We decided that I would finish
       the woman and that Louie would
       do the wings plus the
       background. After some tweaking
       with the wing shape/size in
       sketches done by Louie we came
       to a final look.

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Ok.. But I've been told that
       Louie drew it by hand, scanned
       it, and you co-oped in
       Photoshop?  And you used
       drawing boards to make it? Is
       that not true? 
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: That is not true! I drew the
       wings and background in
       Photoshop, from scratch.
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Well.. We both use a Wacom
       Ultrapad A4 tablet, which is
       basically a pressure sensitive
       replacement for a mouse. It
       works more natural, because you
       draw the same way as you do on
       paper, and thus it's  faster,
       too.
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: A pad is more artistic in some
       strange way, I guess..?

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     So, what do you think will be
       the future of the Amiga scene?
       It seems like you're moving to
       PC (800*600, Photoshop, 24bit
       pictures)
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Bridges are made to cross,
       that's my theory. 
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Well.. I'm personally not too
       keen on keep doing 256
       pictures.. The 24bit aspect has
       finally freed us as artists. No
       more hardware limitations
       concerning colors. Now we can
       almost paint like we both used
       to on paper.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Well, yes. But don't you feel
       attached to the Amiga scene? Or
       do you both think it's ok to
       convert to the PC scene? A 24
       bit Amiga scene will probably
       never exist..
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Well.. The Amiga was great a
       few years ago, but it has been
       lagging behind ever since! 

»CL3:Danny:»CL0: But as far as our computer work
       goes, NO, we do NOT scan. It's
       simply not interesting! There's
       no challenge what so ever.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Oh? Don't you even scan
       sketches made by hand? Which
       YOU have made?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Well, since I also draw on
       paper it would be tempting to
       scan my own stuff and use that
       for computer work. But the
       worlds in which I draw simply
       lie too far apart to even think
       of doing so. I'll rather try to
       do my best on both seperately..
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Hmm.. I scan some of the
       pictures I make by hand. It's
       quicker sometimes.

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Talented graphicians, for
       example Made, have admitted
       that they use the scanner quite
       a lot.. What do you think about
       that?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Did Made admit he uses a
       scanner? When and where??
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Yes, he admitted it in an
       interview with No Sense.
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Oh, that's really odd, since he
       (not too long ago) accused me
       of scanning my stuff. I got
       REALLY furious! He had a jpg of
       a photo I had used as reference
       for my TP6 picture. So he said
       my pictures are copies. It's so
       incredibly frustrating and
       disrespectfull to hear someone
       comment on your work by saying
       it is scanned when you've
       worked so many hours to do it
       the fair way!
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     I know! But I don't see how YOU
       can be accused of that? People
       must surely have seen that you
       have been talented a long time?
       I mean.. Quite Unusual,
       Lovelocks, etc.
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Well.. The long time sceners
       may see that, but there's new
       people coming to the scene
       every day. It's those people
       who seem to be ignorant of the
       truth.
»CL4:Q:»CL0: But Made's not a newbie. I think
       it's strange.
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Yes.. I couldn't believe he
       accused me. We spoke a long
       time on IRC. I was trying to
       open his eyes.. I guess I
       convinced him a bit.

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Anyway.. you both do quite a
       lot of commercial work? Danny
       works at Domark, etc?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: Yes. But it's Eidos Interactive
       btw..
»CL4:Q:»CL0: Ok. Do you get many offers from
       game companies etc?
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: During the Party 3 I got quite
       some. Nowadays not as much
       though, but I didn't have any
       difficulties with getting the
       job I have now. There's a lot
       of companies who'd like to see
       me come I guess.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Yes, I know. :)
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Right now I'm working for
       Digital Illusions.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Oh, any secret projects?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: We're developing a 3D game for
       PSX and PC. 
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     That's sounds nice! A pity it
       isn't released on Amiga,
       though..

(At this moment, Danny had to go, but
Louie stayed to finish the interview)

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Well, the time is running, you
       must go, don't you? I think
       I've gotten enough answers to
       make a nice interview.. :)
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: okay.. :)
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Thank you VERY MUCH! I REALLY
       appreciate it! :D
»CL3:Danny:»CL0: well. you're welcome dude!
       anytime.. 

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     So, Louie, then it's just the
       two of us. :)
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Guess so..

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     I noticed that you were treated
       very much like a VIP person at
       The Gathering. You got a
       separate room where you could
       smoke, drink and all sorts of
       stuff.. :) So, I wonder.. If
       you were a totally unknown
       graphician, would you still be
       on the scene? Does the
       prize-money mean much to you,
       or are you just doing it for
       the fun?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: Hmm.. Well.. It gives me a very
       good feeling to walk up to the
       stage and receive my prize. At
       that moment, I think I feel
       more or less like an athlete
       who has just won a
       championship. Perhaps that's
       what keeps me going, I don't
       know, really. Prizes are nice,
       that's not the main issue,
       though. I do it for the fun.

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Ok! I have been wondering about
       a thing. Perhaps the readers
       don't care, but I do! There has
       been a lot of rumours about
       your relatively old picture "Me
       and my little sis". People say
       all sorts of stuff.. Like
       you've scanned it from a
       Swedish magazine. Is this true?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: No, that's not true. I first
       drew it on paper, and then I
       scanned my sketch in black and
       white. I used Brilliance's tint
       function to colorize the
       picture. Not much to say about
       it, really, as it's really old.

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Well, it seems like both of you
       have more or less stopped using
       your Amiga... Will you ONLY
       make 24-bit pictures in the
       future, even though great art
       packages like Brilliance and
       PPaint exist on the Amiga?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: As you know, both Offa and Eq
       have totally quit the Amiga
       scene, for example. I think
       that will be more or less the
       case for me too.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     So, are you going to quit the
       scene in the near future, or
       will you keep making pictures
       for the various parties?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: That's a nice question. I
       haven't really given it too
       much thought yet. But I have
       been thinking about making a
       24-bit slideshow for a while
       now... I am still going to go
       to parties, I think. Not only
       for the compos, but just aswell
       for meeting friends. That's
       what's fun.

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Finally, I have always
       wondered.. When you start
       drawing your pictures.. What
       goes through your head? Do you
       just want to make a nice pic,
       or are you trying to say
       something with it?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: I think a whole lot about the
       pictures before I start
       drawing. It all started when I
       whas making "Wishes". Wishes
       has a rather deep story to it..
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Oh, tell me?
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: I thought about a little girl,
       about 12 years old, who is a
       drug abuser. She wants to stop.
       She wants to get them. The
       picture shows a little girl who
       wants to be free. Like the
       water.. Like the clouds. She
       wants to be free in both body
       and soul.
»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Whoa! You should start
       attaching text files to the
       pictures. ;)
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: :)

»CL4:Q:»CL0:     Well, no matter how interesting
       I think it is talking to you,
       we must end this interview
       before it gets too long! :)
       Thank you very much for
       answering my questions, I
       really appreciate it!
»CL2:Louie:»CL0: No problem! Cya around! :)
