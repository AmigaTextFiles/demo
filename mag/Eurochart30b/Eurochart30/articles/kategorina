»SML:»CL9:--------------------------------------

»CL0:Yes, it is now time for another change
of categories in »CL8:The Official 
Eurochart».

»BIG:What we have decided to do is to
remove the "»CLA:swappers»CL0:" chart and
include an "»CLA:editors»CL0:" chart instead.
»SML:
This happens due to several facts,
namely that there are not that many
real swappers left, which means that
either people are just not able to
vote in this category, or they just
vote for some friends of theirs who
they happen to be swapping a little
with. And that is not really the
purpose of a swappers' chart.

The fact that some people seem to
think that swapping is about to die as
a scene function is no direct reason 
for us to exclude this category.

The "»CL9:swappers»" chart will be replaced 
by an "»CL9:editors»" chart from »CL8:The 
Official Eurochart #31» and onwards.

Many people (especially editors :-)
has been asking us to include this
category, so now it has happened
guys! 

So if you happen to vote from an old
sheet, remember the change of
categories.
