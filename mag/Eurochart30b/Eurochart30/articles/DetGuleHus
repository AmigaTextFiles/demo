»SML:»CL9:-------------------------------------

»CL0:Yes, it is true. You have reached the
end of another issue of »CL9:The Official
Eurochart». It is now the time to
wonder if you have missed something in
this issue, and to make a note in your
mind that you should remember to send
in your »BIG:»CLA:vote»SML:» for the next issue as
well.

As the number-fanatics among you will
remember, the next issue will be issue
#31, and that one will be released at
about the »CL4:1st of October».
This means that the deadline for all
contributions is the »CL4:15th of 
september».
Feel free to send in any contributions
after this date, but do not expect us
to use them. You might get
disappointed.

Anyhow, we salute everyone who
supported us in various ways (cheers),
send our biggest wishes for a quick
»CLA:death» of »CL7:DGC» (thank you for spoiling
TCP), and finally, till next time:
 »PIC:BD2»
