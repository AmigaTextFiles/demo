»CL0:Spot and Plus8 of 3LE are probably not
among the most known members of the
quite popular Swedish group. We
decided to find out more about them.
Here is the result. In the following,
these abbrevations apply.

EC: »CL2:Eurochart.»
SP: »CL4:Spot/3LE.»
P8: »CL6:Plus8/3LE.»

EC: »CL2:What is your function in 3LE and
    how long have you been a member?
    (A bit about yourself, perhaps!)»

SP: »CL4:Well, I do graphics and design and
    I've been a member since Nov`96 I
    also took my dear friend Plus8
    with me. but I knew some of the
    original members since a long time
    ago, so i guess I made myself at
    home quite fast.  Now a little
    about myself: I started scening
    for real on the Amiga back in
    1992. I was into the C64 before
    that but back then most of the
    time was wasted on gaming. :) 
    My older brother (Hitchhiker of
    Digitech) was the one who got me 
    hooked to the scene at first. He
    was awake all nights coding demos
    and packmenus and entering strange
    competitions and stuff. Back then
    I always adored those neverending
    bobs and the first time I saw a
    line vector it was already to
    late! I had become a 
    scene-addict! Time went on I sold
    my C64 and bought my brothers
    Amiga and I have been in a lot of
    more or less known groups to
    finally end up here in Three
    little elks (???) I sure hope so
    atleast.»
P8: »CL6:I do graphic design and promotes
    3LE with posters and stuff. I
    joined together with Spot in Nov
    `96, it was a package-deal really.
    ;) I didn't know any of the
    members before, except Ant, but
    I've found myself comfortable with
    the others. Plus8 history: I
    re-joined the scene in early `96
    after some years in "exile". Spot
    persuaded me to go to Icing96 with
    him, and after that I was hooked
    on the scene. Again. To mention
    The Old Days, I got my first Amiga
    back in `89.»

EC: »CL2:Do you like being a member/How
    come, you like it?»
SP: »CL4:Jupp, It comes with age.
    Seriously, we are very good
    friends inside the group and thats
    actually what really matters. We
    don't release as many megs/week as
    Hellfire but I think I can live
    with that. ;)»
P8: »CL6:Definetly. All of the members are
    creative and supports new ideas,
    and since I do graphic design for
    a living this was the perfect
    group for me.»

EC: »CL2:Personally, I'm a great fan of the
    crazy style and design of  3LE's
    demos. What do you think of it? Do
    you make weird graphics yourself?»
SP: »CL4:Do I make weird graphics? BOY DO I
    MAKE WEIRD GRAPHICS!!! Nah, I
    think that you have to judge for
    yourself. I think I'm a bit more
    into design and the overall looks
    rather than pure pixeling at the
    moment but that does absolutely
    not mean that I don't do some
    pictures and logos every now and
    then.  I like the craziness in the
    3LE demos but I think that there's
    a lack of design in some ways.»
P8: »CL6:3LE has, in a way, found its niche
    on the scene, but some projects
    that are in the works right now
    may take 3LE in another direction.
    But to cite my good friend Yoda:
    "Always in motion is the future".
    Regarding the weird graphics, I
    don't do any. Just freaky
    experiments with typography.»

EC: »CL2:The ELK-animations. I'm pretty
    sure that everybody loves them.
    have they come to stay? Will 3LE
    release a pack with them someday?
    (Please :-))»
SP: »CL4:Some people say, some don't.»
P8: »CL6:Silents is/are golden. ;)»

EC: »CL2:How does the future look for 3LE
    in general? more funny demos? Any
    wild plans?»
SP: »CL4:The future is quite bright if you
    ask me, we have a lot of planned
    releases and everything is just
    fine. The happy ones who live near
    Gothenburg (Spot, Plus8, Tabasco,
    Explorer, Android & Nude) meet at
    least once a week over a cup of
    coffee. Rumours say that there is
    currently a demo starring the
    ultra cute Hello Kitty and her
    friends under developement.»
P8: »CL6:Not to mention the games
    department!»

EC: »CL2:As you can see in the
    chart-section, 3LE has quickly
    moved itself all the way up among
    the most voted for overall groups.
    Does that surprise you?»
SP: »CL4:No not really, there simply isn't
    that many quality groups left, and
    thats really a shame.»
P8: »CL6:3LE productions always feature a
    sense of humour, and I think
    that's a major part of the
    "success". I mean, few groups
    manage to have a consequent
    approach to their line of demos.»

EC: »CL2:Are there any plans of increasing
    the memberlist in 3LE? How's your
    organization? Are you all close
    friends outside the scene as well?»
SP: »CL4:The amount of members is according
    to me just fine. But who knows?
    The organization is good, most of
    the times. I mean, we meet a lot
    and my phonebill is starting to
    get awfully high.»
P8: »CL6:I think the same as Spot, except
    that I only got a GSM phone, so
    it's the others' phone Bills
    that's going sky-high. ;)»

EC: »CL2:Thanks for answering! You are free
    to greet whoever you want!»
SP: »CL4:Charlie says: Always tell ya mama
    before you're goin' somewhere...
    [Miiiaaaoouuuuiiieeiii]»
P8: »CL6:I'd like to greet Kenneth. Hi.»

We hope that you have all
learned a bit more about
this funny group by now!
