DalNets #amirc corruption goes too far.

FOLLOW UP FROM PREVIOUS NEWS STORY

---

The Beginning

The Amiga is a computer which is in a way very different to the PCs. We don't
use any Microsoft products and we enjoy the luxury of Amiga OS3.0.  Amiga is a
niche computer.  Within the Amiga is a great community filled of great people.

A chat client program called AmIRC was released to allow Amiga owners to use
IRC on the internet. As a default, it will connect you onto the channel
#amirc.  This makes the nam#e #amirc very important.  It is a central Amiga
channel on all IRC networks.  As it is the central one, you would expect it to
behave in an Amiga like way, filled with Amiga People and Amiga People running
it.

But not on Dalnet.  Oh no.  Stardustr has taken #amirc and it is not an Amiga
channel.   It pretends it is, but as you are about to see, you will realise
that it is not.  One guy called Zine/Gring0 constantly is cauing trouble in
there.   But he never gets kicked or banned for it.  Why?  Because he is there
with his PC.  I have no idea how he gets away with it.  

On three occasions now, I have been kicked banned and even nuked for being in
that channel supporting and defending the Amiga against its attacks.  A good
percentage of the AOPS and SOPS are indeed PC Owners who dislike the Amiga. 
Those who do own an Amiga only see it as another computer.  This is wrong,
amiga is a society a culture nearly a  religion.  These weak Amiga Users give
in to the PC regime and support the PC aswell.  This is NOT how an Amiga
channel should be run.

My Nick that night was Boom^




The End

The End is nigh for #amirc.  Stardustr IS going to loose that channel because
he is not capable of running a channel.  Most AOPS in there are not capable of
having Channel Operator Status and as most of the are PC Biased it makes it
totally unfair and wrong. 

Please read the log below it symbolises the corruptness of #amirc and is
nothing but solid hard evidence against them all.  This channel must be
removed and placed into the hands of a true Amigan.


The biggest problems and Lamers in Dalnets #amirc is:

Nick                            Position                Platform

Stardustr            - SOP Channel Founder             - Uses Amiga
ClassyLady           - AOP (And possibly SOP)          - Uses PC
Gener                - SOP                             - Uses PC
Miracle              - AOP                             - Uses PC
Jaimz                - AOP                             - Uses PC
Gring0/Zine          - USER                            - Uses PC
ArRy^                - AOP                             - Uses PC
Nate_Grey            - AOP                             - Uses PC

All these people should be AKICKed from #amirc and be completley deOPed and
deSOPed.

But no, I'll be the one on the AKICK list due to my support and defence of the
Amiga.  Notice the amount of AOPs that are on the PC?? Too many, there
shouldn't be any AOPs using PCs on #amirc. 

What I disagree on what happens in Dalnets #amirc

1.  The freedom of speech is denied to all users, mainly Amiga Users.
2.  The channel is Biased towards the PC and the its users.
3.  The subject 'Amiga' is hardly ever risen.
4.  The name is #amirc its a central default name, it should be 100% pure Amiga
5.  AOPS behave just as bad as the main users do, the AOPS will insult the
    users, yet kick the users if they insult another AOP.
6.  PC owners are AOPed and SOPed.
7.  The Channel Founder is not a true Amigan.
8.  Amigans are kicked banned and nuked for defending their machine.
9.  PC owners are fully supported.
10. The Channel is a threat to the Amiga Community.

I can fully back up those claims.  Look at the log below.  Everything stated
there happened in the log, I am not the only person who belives this as you
will see.

Stardustr calls it a general chat channel.  If he wanted a general chat
channel, the he should have called his channel something like #starchat or
whatever.  By having the name #amirc has its costs too.  It MUST be a full
100% Amiga channel, all PC owners should have their AOP removed.  Before all
the problems, I was a 100% Loyal Amiga user in that channel for months, not
once did I get the offer of AOP.  Why?  Because a PC Lamer was AOP.

Please read the log below, you will understand how corrupt that channel is. 
We must do something to stop this problem.  We are Amiga owners and we will
not simply walk away from a problem.  #AmIRC will be dealt with.

              Here we can see solid evidence that the ops are biased towards PC owners.

              kick fellow Amiga owners out of the channel for defending their machine.  He has

«Kick» You have been kicked out of channel #amirc by Classylady: Classylady

            =  Kick Number 1, For no reason at all except speaking my mind.  Here is the solid
               evidence. All I said that HRH should leave #amirc.  ClassyLady didn't like that
               yet she would allow her best buddy Gring0 to completely slag off everyone else in
               the channel, even when people are saying to the ops.  "Kick Gring0" She still
               does nothing.  Classylady should have her Aops removed.  She is incapable of running
               a channel, and above is the hard evidence.  Not only that, she is a total PC Lamer.
               Just version her, she is sat there infront of a PC in an Amiga channel.  In my
               oppinion, that is just totally taking the piss.

           Infact this guy had changed his version information to make him look as though
           he was on a PC.  Why?  He said that people were kicking and banningh him from channels
           because he was on an amiga.  When I demanded names, he kept quiet.  He said it was

And basically that was the last time I did a window snapshot.  Nothing much else really continued
I just issued the channel with one big warning.

IF I DO NOT SEE A CHANGE OF THE WAY THIS CHANNEL IS RUN, THE CHANNEL WILL BE REMOVED.


I urge all Victims of #amirc to complain to IRCOps.
I urge all those PC Lamers who are AOPED in #amirc to leave and make new freinds in #mirc
I urge Stardustr to hand over the keys to a true Amiga lover.


#AmIRC is rotting, its dieing and its the most corrupt channel on Dalnet.  Stay away.



. 

It is the so called Amigan in #AmIRC that have helped the PC in its path and
destroyed the Amiga.  Most people in #AmIRC are also software pirates and that
is supported also.

We must sort the channel out and return it to a 100% Loyal Amiga channel.
First Actions which needs to be taken are.

1.  All the AOPS and SOPS who are PC Owners or not true Amigans should be
    removed.
2.  Those causing trouble by attacking the Amiga and other Amigans should be
    placed on AKICK.
3.  Stardustr will either have to agree to make it a true 100% Loyal Amiga
    channel or he will have to hand the channel over to somebody else.
4.  IRC Ops should be notified about the crimes in #AmIRC
5.  Amiga Warez and PC Support must be terminated.

Once we have established that and are happy we will then review the channel
and its proceedings and if necerssary decide further action.

If you are a true loyal Amigan and wish to give your support, please e-mail me
on andrew@fitzgerald.u-net.com

Together we will put an end to this.

This mail has also been forwarded to IRCops, a few selected #AmIRC users,the
Online Amiga Universe Mailing List and the personell involved who are
responsible for causing these problems on #AmIRC.

Regards
