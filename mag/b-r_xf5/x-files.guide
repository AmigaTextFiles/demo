@node wanted "wanted"

for the x-files i'm searching for up-to-date news:

with news i mean:

            - memberlists (with username and function (and country if possible))
            - newcommers (with old group if possible)
            - "go-away'ers" (with reason like new group, kicked, left scene))
            - general news about groups (like next releases, planed projects
                                         planned parties, and so on...)
            - information about parties (like invitations, results, reports,
                                         visitor-lists)
            - news about everything that's worth interesting

i can not check every news i get. so it is possible, that an error appears in
the x-files. don't blame me for this, but please mail me the error with the
correction and i will fix it immediately.

i am also searching for ascii-logos for x-files. 

so, if you have news, corrections, comments, suggestions, ideas or anything
else worth mentioning, then contact me at:

@node mekka1996 "Mekka 1996"

 MEKKA 1996

 Mekka 1996 will be organized by - amable -

 29th - 31st of March 1996  in  HITTFELD / GERMANY

  I. Introduction / About Mekka '96
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   No long introduction... There will be a new Demo-Party in germany.
   We do not expect it to be GiGANTIC or GREAT ... we want it to be small
   and special. We try to connect a little group of talented guys, cheap
   entrance fees and some kewl prices for the Compos.
   
   The main intention of MeKKa is, to create a GATHERING , with some WiRED
   attenders who'll make it to THE PARTY of the year.
   [Sorry... don't know how to insert "Assembly" in this ;)]

   We expect you to go on a pilgrimage to demo-Mekka'96 and have fun you
   never thought about.


  II. Where and When
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The Party will be held near Hamburg, the second largest city in Germany.
   We will rent a congress center with room for about 700 persons and 500
   computers.
   First we thought of renting the "Congress Center Hamburg" ... But we
   could not know how many guys will enter the arena -> so we've decided
   to use the smaller room! We do NOT expect more than 700 guys to attend...
   really ;)!

   Date    : Friday 29 to Sunday 31 of March 1996
             The doors will be opend on Friday at 18h [6pm]

   Location: Veranstaltungszentrum "BURG" Seevetal in Hittfeld/Germany
             That's very close to Hamburg.

   The center lies between 3 motorways so it's the easiest way to get there
   by car/bus, but to come by train and airplane will be possible too
   although it is more expansive.


  III. Costs
  ~~~~~~~~~~
   As you know Mekka will be held the first time in 1996. To calculate how
   many people we have to expect please registrate. Therefor you will get
   a reserved table for your computer(s). The earlier you reserve the better
   will be the place of the table reserved for you in the party-room (to read
   about registering scroll down a bit).

   Entrance fee:
   .............
   You pay in advance  : DM 25,- / person (about 17 US-Dollars)
   You are registered  : DM 30,- / person (about 21 US-Dollars)
   Without registration: DM 35,- / person (about 25 US-Dollers)

   The organisation is NON-COMMERCIAL!!! As usual the entrace-fee will be
   distributed among the winners of the competitions.

   We will be able to change foreign currency into german deutschmarks
   during the hole party. Please concider that our exchange-rate may not
   be very good.

   The Price includes:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     - a table where you can place your computer
     - electricity
     - access to the party-network (if we get a network, see below)
     - the oxigen you wast at the party-place ;)

   [There will be enough chairs]


  IV. Features

   important points:

  ~~~~~~~~~~
   The prizes depend on the number of attenders.

     - At least 8.000,- DM will be given.
       There will be both, hard- and softwareprices.

     - This does not concer the surprise-competitions!

     - If there are less than 200 attenders at the Party, there will be a

       We DO NOT WANT A JURY and hope enough freaks are comming! 


  VIII. Network
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Many parties in the last time had a party-network and we are trying to
   have one too. It has a lot of advantages e.g.

     - voting will be more easier and secure and

     - all the entries of the competition will be stored on the server and
       will be free to download a competition is finished.

   We do NOT guarantee the network, but we will try very hard to get one!


  IX. CD-ROM
  ~~~~~~~~~~
   We think that a CD-ROM is not the most important feature of a Party (!)
   but we hope to have a Party-CDROM anyhow. We will try hard too!


  X. T-Shirt
  ~~~~~~~~~~
   Nearly every party has a Party T-Shirt. We will produce a T-Shirt too...

   It will be a very HIGH-Quality-shirt. It'll be designed by a well known
   local guy, who already designed VERY kewl shirts.

   You'll love it but remeber... it's limited!!!


  XI. Sponsors
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   We have not finished the conversation with all of our sponsors so we are
   not able to give you a list of them yet.

     - We can tell you that one of our sponsors will be a well known
       international software-producer! [NOT MS! ;) ]

   The complete list of sponsors will be released in a few days!

 Symposium '96

                          -------------------------
                           The Official Invitation
                          -------------------------

1.> WHAT

   This  file  wants  to  tell  you  that  there  will be a quite delicious
   computer  demo festival this year, involving all the platforms which are
   important  in  the  guild  of  the  demomakers,  namely Amiga, PC, C-64,
   Archimedes and the Atari ST/Falcon.  Think twice before missing it!

                     **\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/**

2.> WHO

   This  event  is  held  by  three of the most experienced party-organizer
   teams  in  Germany:   the people behind the 680XX-Convention (1993), the
   Black  Box  Symposium (1995) and the Fried Bits.  For the Symposium '96,
   which  we plan to become the best German party so far, these three teams
   fusioned  for  not  standing  in  competition  to each other but joining
   forces and making everything better than ever!

   The  groups  involved  are:   Polka  Brothers,  Lego Club, Phantasm (for
   Amiga), Avena, Absence (for Atari) and Oxyron (for C-64).

                     **\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/**

3.> WHY

   We, the organizers, observed that the amount of poorly organized and too
   commercial  parties  increased  during  the  last years, even outside of
   Germany.   Our  country  has  always  been  well  known for low-standard
   parties, but 1995 has been the most disappointing year.

   We (and probably the rest of the scene, too) felt that it was time for a
   party  where  you  could  have  fun  again,  a  party that would be well
   organized,  and  NOT  a  party  at  which  you feel that not you is what
   counts, but the money.

   We don't want to rent huge congress centres, we don't want to organize a
   party  with hundreds of super-duper hyper interactive virtual multimedia
   features,  we  don't want to make money - we all just want a party where
   you  are  welcome to have a nice time; which is, after all, what a party
   is ought to be.

                     **\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/**

4.> WHEN

   Eastern 1996.  Four days of fun and experience:

   START  5th April, 1200 CET
   END    8th April, 1200 CET

   The  entrace  fee  will  amount  to  35DM.   We  will not accept foreign
   currencies.

                     **\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/-\-/**

5.> WHERE

   A  nice  convention center called "Veranstaltungszentrum Burg Seevetal",
   which  is located in the very near south of Hamburg, Germany.  It offers
   place for about 1000 people including computers, a really big screen and
   surround  sound.   You  don't  have  to  be afraid of 24h of loud music,
   though...

   You  can reach it via everything.  If you're going to come by train, you
   first  have to reach Hamburg Hauptbahnhof (main station) and take the S3
   or  S31 (on Gleis 4, HVV price 4DM) to "Harburg", where we will pick you
   up  with  the  Symposium shuttle service.  Alternatively, you can use of
   the hourly public busses to "Seevetal".

   Coming  by  plane,  you  will use the bus shuttle service to the station
   "Ohlsdorf", wait for the U1, get out at Hamburg Hauptbahnhof and, again,
   take the S3/S31 to reach "Harburg".

   If   you   arrive   by  ship,  then  you'll  have  to  take  the  U3  at
   "Landungsbrücken" to reach the Hauptbahnhof.

   If  you  come by spaceship, there is a big area on the other side of the
   Symposium  convention center; please try to land it there (parking is of
   course free).

   For  the  case that you own a car, you have two possibilities to arrive:
   The  A1  ("Autobahn  1") and the A7.  Coming from the north or south via
   A7/B4,  you  have  to  leave at Abfahrt "Fleestedt".  Then roll down the
   "Hittfelder  Landstraße" (part of the B4) southwards and follow the sign

 The Gathering 96

 This is a preliminary official invitation to The Gathering 1996 
 
 -------- Introduction -------------------------------------------------- 
 
                      CRUSADERS Productions ARE BACK!!! 
 
 AND THROUGH THE KANDU ORGANIZATION THEY ARE QUITE DETERMINED TO MAKE 
 THE GATHERING 1996 INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT ALTOGETHER. 
 
 We have heard your complaints about bad choice of locations, loss of power,
 poor networking, expensive entry fees, prizes that were not paid until many
 months after the party and so forth... 
 
 AND WE CORRECTED THEM ALL (well, most of them anyway). 
 By using only professional companies instead of doing everything ourselves,
 everything you need for a great party will be there. 
 
                IN TIME, IN PLACE and IN A WORKABLE ORDER 
                ----------------------------------------- 
 
 Together with some the largest companies around, we're going to make the 
 THE GATHERING 1996 more fun, more non-stop action, more no-holds barred 
 computer action than any other party! 
 
 Just a pie in the sky? Read on... 
 
 -------- hot spots ----------------------------------------------------- 
 
 LOCATION:   "VIKINGSKIPET" in Hamar, north of Oslo, Norway. 
             The main hall from the '94 Olympics in Norway. 
             (If you don't know what the Olympics are, you are just the 
             guy we want at TG, and believe us, the hall is big!!!) 
 
             12.000 square meters of pure pleasure.
 
             3000+ seats, tables and SEPARATE poweroutlets available. 
             Every person gets a seat, every person gets a tablespace 
             and every person gets his own grounded poweroutlet. 
                (1 outlet per person, bring your own grounded 
                 multiple power outlets to have more than one item 
                 connected at a time). 
 
             More than 20 seperate wardrobes with 4-10 showers per 
             wardrobe. Don't panic, bring your own towel. 
 
             Catering will be provided. In our next info, prices and a 
             day-to-day menu will be included. Junkfood and not-so-junk 
             food will be served at your leisure. 
             Silicone and methane lifeforms make special arrangments. 
 
 PARKING:    Big parking facilities available immediately outside the
             hall at no extra charge. Will take any kind of possible
             vehicle you can arrive in. Extraterrastials call ahead for
             separate reservations. 
             Limousine service available. 
 
 DATE:       Easter'96 
             System Boot     : Tuesday 2 April 1996 00:01am 
             System Shutdown : Saturday 6 April 1996 11:59am 
 
 PRICE:      More than 100 hours of party for maximum 200 NOK! 
             (About US$ 30) 
             As usual, girls and non-Europeans are let in for *FREE*. 
             ET's also have free entrance but have to provide their
             own phones. 
             Prices MIGHT change for the lower, but no promises yet. 
 
 NETWORK:    1500++ Ethernet connections with high speed internal and 
             Internet party network from day 0 at NO EXTRA CHARGE!! 
             98% COAX connections, bring your HUB's for TP-connections. 
 
             You just need a PC with an Ethernet-card, or buy one from us 
             for 250 NOK (US$ 35) (16bits NE2000 cards for ISA-bus only). 
             This is non-profit way for us get YOU onto the network if
             you don't already have a Ethernet card. You get to keep the
             card after the party. No rentals or credit plans available. 
             Major body parts acceptable as a shortterm deposit. 
 
 POWER:      Seperate poweroutlet per person, 20 persons per breaker 
             switch. 
             3000 Amps available instantly, and our special TECH task
             force will be monitoring the powergrid at all hours. 
             The hall itself is providing this as a courtesy service, so 
             it's not us spending the week putting the power up. It's in 
             place the week BEFORE the party. 
 
 COMPOS:     Demo, intro, music, gfx and wild competitions will be held, 
             plus a few surprises... See separate paragraph for more 
             info. 
 
 VIDEO:      Hot new movies and all the old goodies will be shown at 
             regular intervals, 24 hours a day, all week. 
             A special auditorium with 200 quality seats and 
             superb audiovisual equipment provides the quality experience 
             for all of you moviebuffs. 
             If it's good enough for Olympic hot-shots it's certainly 
             good enough for you. 
 
 SLEEPING:   Special arrangements with the local fire department allow 
             sleeping inside the hall. (No more sleeping outside in a 
             tent, we're computer freaks and not Grizzly Adam's fans.)

 -------- transport ----------------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 How to get there: 
 
 From Oslo: 
 - Drive E6 north (towards Trondheim) from Oslo for about 75 minutes, and 
   follow the signs to "Vikingskipet Olympic Arena". 
   If you miss it, make your driver wear larger glasses! 
   If you miss it twice, make your driver wear dark sunglasses and white 
   cane. 
 
 - Trains for Hamar depart from Oslo Central station every hour, the 
   hall is located about 500 meters from the station. 
 
 - Bus transports will be scheduled, contact us for booking information. 
 
 - If you arrive by plane or boat in Norway, follow the above 
   directions from Oslo or call us for further instructions. 
 
 From Trondheim or northern Norway: 
 - Drive E6 South (towards Oslo) and follow the signs again. 
 
 From Sweden or Finland: 
 - Drive until you hit E6 in Norway and turn either South or North 
   depending on your location. Ask the nearest gas station. 
 
 As several hundred thousand people made it during the Olympics, and 
 nearly every person in Norway know where Hamar/Vikingskipet is, ASK!!! 
 
 Map will be available at a later date at WEB-site and in the written 
 invitation. 
 
 -------- Rules --------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 General rules that really should be obvious... 
 
 - Political, racist and religious activities will not be tolerated. 
   The organizers reserve EXCLUSIVE right to determine what will be 
   tolerated or not. 
 
 - Commercial activity or trading will not be allowed without prior
 written permission from the organizers. (And a proper bribe of
 course). 
 
 - Alcohol, drugs, firearms, projectile weapons, fireworks and nuclear
 devices not intended for transportation are not allowed inside or
 immediately outside the hall. 
 
 - We will not be held responsible for damaged or stolen property. 
 
 - Software piracy, hacking and illegal swapping will not be tolerated. 
   Hacking the network is probably fun, but so is living the rest of 
   your life without any testicles!! 
   Remember!! Norwegians eat Rudolf's testicles for X-mas. 
 
 -------- Technical Stuff ----------------------------------------------- 
 
 - All electrical equipment must be properly put together following 
   normal electrical regulations. Equipment not following this easy rule 
   will not be allowed to hook up to the power grid. 
 
 - Microwave ovens, grills, toasters, refridgerators, electric chairs and 
   other equipment that may cause electrical noise, power surges or 
   electrocutive experiences will not be allowed inside the party hall. 
 
 - The party network will be based upon a 100 Mbit backbone. However, we 
   will only be able to connect you to it via standard 10 Mbit COAX BNC 
   connections at each table. 
   IPX/SPX and IP protocols are the only protocols supported. 
 
 - ANY AND ALL network connections are to be made by TECHNET crew personell. 
   The only thing you should do yourself is installling your own 
   networkclient at your workstation. The Tech Crew will be provide 
   assistance for those who need it to get you onto he network. 
 
 - Tampering with the network or power system will not be accepted!! 
   Time and technical restrictions makes this a FRIENDSHIP rule. 
 
 -------- Alternative Easter -------------------------------------------- 
 
 Why not combine THE GATHERING with your normal Easter holiday? 
 
 About two hours of driving from Hamar, you find HAFJELL and KVITFJELL,
 the arenas that hosted the alpine diciplines during the 1994 Winter
 Olympics. 
 These are two of Scandinavia's most modern alpine centers today, well
 suited for those family members who don't want to spend the entire week
 indoor. 
 
 As well is Hamar a tourist site in itself. Olympics arenas and scenic 
 nature is just part of what makes Hamar interesting. 
 
 For those of you above 18, Hamar also provides a semi-interesting 
 nightlife. Remember that drunken bastards will not be let into the hall, 
 so behave yourself a bit. 
 
 -------- KANDU --------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 KANDU (Kreativ Aktiv Norsk Data Ungdom) would translate into 
 "Creative Active Norwegian Computer Youth" was formed by Crusaders, 
 Cryptoburners, ATC and a few other groups in order to show people
 outside the scene what we are capable of, a vital step in the process of
 getting economical support for a project of this magnitude. 
 
 You may join KANDU through our web site, or by contacting us directly. 
 
 -------- Last but not least -------------------------------------------- 
 
 Remember, this is only a preliminary invitation file, and all
 information stated above may be subject to change without notice. If you
 have any suggestions or comments, please feel free to contact us as
 stated elsewhere in this document. 
 
 No warranties are expressed or implied...or something like that.
