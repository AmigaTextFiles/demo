«c2»Ok, let's be a little bit official then. This interview is done with a 
newcomer to the Amiga scene, and I thought that might interest you people 
out there, because he is in a newcomer Amiga group as well, which is set 
to release their first production at «c4»TRSAC.. «c2»So KFD, let us start by asking 
you how you came to know the Amiga scene?«» 
«»
«c5»*kfd^trn* By happenstance... I found some Italian articles written by 
Randy/Comax about the Amiga scene... And I (casually) knew Mod3m and Lanch 
of Darkage... They have given me all the help possible to get to know the 
scene and try to do something. But my real love for the Amiga scene was 
probably born in 1986/87.«»
«c2»Dark: Ok, that's a long time ago! What is your profession in your group, and 
how did you assemble Trinity? Was it easy to form a group after entering the 
scene, or what happened? :)«»
«»
«c5»*kfd^trn* I'm the founder of Trinity and musician and graphician. Firstly 
I've great determination to release something... So I've thought that it 
was easier for me to create a new group than to join one :D«»
«»
It was hard for me find the first members (in fact we haven't any Amiga 
coders right now) but in the scene I found a lot of «c4»friends, «c5»with the same 
love for the scene as I, ready to help :)«»
«»
«c2»Dark: Yeah, it is great with people helping out newcomers. So, what are the 
plans of your group right now?«»
«»
«c5»*kfd^trn* To find an Amiga coder (ehehehe), release our demo at TRSAC and to
working on creating our own style. All those things that we haven't 'cause 
we're really young.«»
«»
«c2»Dark: Who is a member of «c4»Trinity «c2»now, and are they all newcomers ready to 
take on the Amiga scene? :)«»
«»
«c5»*kfd^trn* Trinity are right now: me (real newcomer ;)), «c6»xOANINO «c5»(not a real 
newcomer, but no more active in the demo scene), «c6»Lanch «c5»(ex Darkage, old 
skool graphician, in the scene for 10 years, a big friend), «c6»BossRobot 
«c5»(another real newcomer), «c6»lsv4057 «c5»a cool polish graphician :)«»
«»
«c2»Dark: Yes, I see that there is no coder in your group, so who is doing the 
code for your TRSAC demo?«»
«»
«c5»*kfd^trn* «c4»Mod3m/Darkage, «c5»and I would thank him 'cause he helped me very 
much. He probably was the first to encourage me. Now I am to do some small 
things for Darkage, for example a little bit of graphic for the Spo3 
invitation and the mod for the gallery of ShowTime #15.«»
«»
«c2»Dark: How have you felt your stay in the Amiga scene so far, what is cool, 
what is bad, and what do you, as a newcomer think about the so often talked 
about state of the scene?«»
«»
«c5»*kfd^trn* Until now my stay is really cool, the coolest thing is doing 
something for an uncommercial platform, the pride to be a part of something 
completely different from the normal computerowners. I've thought about the 
state of the scene. I know that once it was bigger, but I think that the 
Amiga scene will be the only thing that will never really let the Amiga 
die, the Amiga scene is too tough to die!«»
«c2»Dark: So, have you met most of the scene people on this channel, AmigaSCNE,
and what do you think about this channel as a way of meeting people and 
getting work done?«»
«»
«c5»*kfd^trn* It is a good meeting place, 'cause you meet sceners from other 
countries and for me right now, it is the only way to have conctact with 
other sceners and groups.«»
«»
«c2»Dark: Ok, thanks for this short interview, and as is tradition, you may
now say some last words, greet people you have met, etc.. :)«»
«»
«c5»*kfd^trn* I would only thank you for the time you've granted me :)«»
«»
«c2»No problem, I wish you and Trinity all the best for your stay in our 
scene :) And to get some things clear, there was another newcomer group 
called Trinity, which came from the PC, but they are not this Trinity, and they
should already be dead again.«»
