«c4»TRSAC 00.5 REPORT«»

«as»«»
«c5»Yep, this was a small, danish party,
held the «c2»3-5th November in Horsens. «c5» In
regards to advertisement for this
party, it must be said that I have
never seen anybody advertize more for
any party, than what Nico and Booster
did for this, on «c2»#amigascne, «c5» hehe. And
did it pay off?«»
«»
Well, in a way it did, there was a
respectable amount of foreign
releases, and there were some foreign 
attenders, infact quite notable 
attenders, namely «c2»Rubberduck and Kalms 
«c5»themselves. Hehe, they both complain 
that we didn't talk more with them, 
but hey, that's because danes are 
racistic and they especially hate
swedes ;)«»
«»
Anyway, there were around «c2»40 people
present, «c5»would be my guess, 2/3 Amiga
owners and the rest PC owners I think,
as this party was for both the Amiga
and PC scene. I did not see many
people playing games either, except
for the girls present, who played a
lot of Viper, Wonderboy and some
really old moonbuggy game on the
arcademachine the organizers had
supplied for free.«»
«»
As to the facilities, the party was
located in a school complex, and the
mainhall was quite sufficient for the
people present, twice as many could
easily have been crammed in, I guess.
They had a separate sleeping hall too,
which was located well away from all
the noise, so that was sufficient. As
for their toilets, some of the paper
ran out the second day, and wasn't
replaced, tsk, tsk.. Well, not that
sceners wash their hands anyway, haha.
There was also a nice bar, where one
could buy snacks, soda and beer
(ofcourse) for some very, very
reasonable prices, and they served 2
free TRSAC birthday cakes saturday 
evening, as they did at the last TRSAC 
too, because one of the organizers had
his birthday wednesday before the
party. Very nice, and the cake even
tasted rather good I must say :)«»

Ok, now let's go over to the actual
partyreport and impressions. We were 5
«c2»IRIS' «c5»ers attending, driving across
Denmark and picking up people in
Adonis's car. We were Adonis, Cupid,
Ransom, TrickTrax and yours truly
present, and we had decided to support
TRSAC instead of TP with our releases,
so we did appear with one almost
finished demo, one 70% finished
oldsk00l intro and a picture from Yon,
our polish graphician. So, people had
to set up their computers and start
working right away, or atleast Cupid,
TrickTrax and Ransom had to work, the
two boring swappers only had to booze
and talk ofcourse, although I also had
to force Cupid to code, naturally.
Ahh, it is such hard work being an
organizer.. So, friday went quite
fast, as the party officially opened
at 20 o-clock or around there, and we
began boozing with various people
until I went to bed at around 5 in the
morning. There were some demos shown
on the bigscreen, but not really that
many that day. The bigscreen, while of
a nice enough quality, was WAY too
dark, and merged many colors into one,
so to speak. The best test of a good
setup with your bigscreen is always
how easy it is to view stars swirling
around on the screen, and we could
almost not see any stars on that one.«» 
«»
That friday I also talked some hours
with one of the TP mainorganizers,
Heavyhead, who had shown up to check
out how a scene party was like, heh.
He disappeared the same day, but we
had agreed to meet up and chat about
TP, about what could be made better,
etc., as I wrote about in my EC41
article. Well, together with other
sceners and their suggestions, we
managed to do a list about things that
had to be changed about TP in order
for it to become acceptable amongst
sceners again, now it is up to the TP
organizers to actually implement these
changes, but we will see about that. I
will write a separate article about it
for this issue of DISC, or for the
EC42.«»

The next day, more things did happen.
Our coders were still struggling with
the releases, and it became clear that
neither «c2»Loonies «c5»nor we could finish
our stuff in time, which was pretty
obvious from the start, hehe. So, we
got the time we needed, up to the
start of the compo's. This is ofcourse
a nice thing, but I also think that,
at these small partiees, where every
release counts, and where there are
not a huuuge amount of releases, you
might aswell set the deadline to
aprox. one hour before showing the
stuff, as there's not much work in
preparing the productions for the
organizers. There were also some 
special happenings this day, like the 
HD throwing compo, won by Ransom, and
then we had some funny 'smash the
damn PC' compo, arranged by Cupid and
T1, hehe.. It was funny watching
people smashing a PC to bits and
pieces with an iron bar, and yours
truly participated gleefully aswell,
although I would have cringed if it
was my own PC, haha.. Ahh, the 
hypocrisy... Most people smashing
the PC had one themselves I guess but
it was still fun ;)«»
«»
In the evening, it was time for the
compos to start. And here I can't be
that nice in my review. The organizer
in charge of the compos did fuck up
here and there, during to him being
confused/stressed or something. In the
4chn compo, some entries were messed
up, resulting in the wrong module
being played. Well, that got sorted 
out, but in the gfx competition, Yon's 
picture was not shown, which was a 
real shame, as it surely was one of 
the best. Well, the organizer said 
that he hadn't gotten any picture from 
us, but he had, we had even asked 
him to rename it, and he said sure he 
would, so it was a bit strange that he 
denied getting it. Well, they would 
show it later, he promised, infact he 
promised it many times during the 
evening. This always sucks a bit, 
because people by that time have made 
up their mind as to what they will 
vote, but the organizer promised to 
show it right before the Amiga 
democompo, and that was ok by us. 
Well, the picture did not get shown, 
despite some reminders from us, he 
'forgot' about it. Maybe he thought 
that it wasn't that important, but 
hey, this was Yon's first competition 
release, with a nice and original 
picture that would very likely have 
been in between the best 3, it is not 
such a small matter, and infact, a 
very lame and unprofessional thing to 
do.«» 
«»
So, with that off my chest, I can
proceed with the competitions. Many of
those had foreign entries in them,
like the Amiga demo, intro and
oldsk00l competitions, and that just
shows how much work the organizers did
to get some releases at «c2»TRSAC, «c5»which
was nice. The Amiga intro competition
only had the entry from DCS though,
but it was a cool intro from Shape
too. The Oldsk00l compo was won with a
«c2»Spaceballs «c5»demo, and sadly we did not
finish our oldsk00l intro, which
crashed halfway through the intro, but
was shown nonetheless, so that people
could see what we had been working on.
«c2»Beerz «c5»also released a funny little
oldsk00l production too in that compo.
As for the PC side of things, one
intro and one demo was released I
think. Maybe it was 2 demos, but one
of those couldn't run on the
bigscreen, due to its resolution, so I
guess the people who made it were
pretty disappointed. The real
interesting thing was the Amiga demo
competition though, which featured 3
entries, from Loonies, IRIS and
Trinity, a new italian group (look
elsewhere in this mag for my interview
with KFD, its founding member). Heheh
well, this is kinda' hard for me to
write, but actually Loonies won, and
we came in 2nd, hehe. Ok, we got a
measly 2 points less than the Loonies
demo, if just Ransom and TrickTrax had
votefaked as we others did.. Ehrr.
Anyway, the Loonies demo was fun, if
somewhat short, and I do like their
ending, hehe. As for «c2»Trinity «c5»'s first
demo, it was coded by Modem and was
nice as well. Our own demo.. Well, I
do hope you will get your hands on our
own demo :) You can get the releases 
from ftp.amigascne.org if you're 
connected to the net.«» 
«»
After the «c2»democompo, «c5»it was time for
the demoshow on the bigscreen, running
till' aprox. 5 o-clock in the morning.
I was the one to show the A500 demos,
but before that, we had to survive
around 15 PC demos being shown, which
was pretty hard, after the first 3,
there was nothing new to be seen,
gahh. Well, atleast it was funny
watching them try to start around 30
demos, but only succeeding with 15,
haha.«» 
«»
The next day, it was time for the
voting and prizegiving, which was
delayed a bit, maybe because they had
to re-count the votes? Anyway, people
got their ducks (yes, they do not have
prizes, instead they hand out gold,
silver and bronze ducks, an original
idea really) and then everyone broke 
up and left the organizers to clean up 
the place, hehe. All in all a nice 
party, ok facilities, nice gimmicks 
and surprise compo's and some quite 
fine releases I think. And that's it, 
nothing mega hyper special cool, but a 
nice and small party where one can 
booze and chat with friends, ofcourse 
I will attend the next one too, 
although I do think the organizers are 
a bit too fast, by arranging the next 
one in February already.«»
