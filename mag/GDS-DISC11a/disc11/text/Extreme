«»«as»
«c5»There haven't been many known and good russian groups around, but «c2»Extreme
«c5»was certainly both good and from «c2»Russia!«»
«»
«c5»It got got founded the 12th of July 1997 when various russian groups
«c2»joined forced «c5»to accomplish something extremely good. The groups that
melted together to Extreme were «c2»Magic Soft, Megacode, Beermans and Speed
Co.«»
«»
«c5»In Russia Extreme is considered to be one of the biggest and most
famous computer groups. It's not only present on «c2»amiga, «c5»but also on «c2»ZX
Spectrum.«»
«»
«c5»Anyway, I guess most sceners got aware of the «c2»great productions «c5»from this
group around 1999, when lots of «c2»quality intros «c5»hit the scene. Extreme won
many parties and impressed quite many sceners with their «c2»unique style.
«c5»Especially the code was «c2»awesome, «c5»as the intros didn't offer much more
really.«»
«»
In any case, about all Extreme releases have hit the various charts hard.
The intro «c2»Push «c5»is good, and was appreciated by many sceners and also all
of these 4k intros. I guess many people will remember productions such as
«c2»Freedom, Revision, Wish, Gap and Dust. «c5»They are all extreme. I didn't know
it was possible to insert so much into 4k and still have music.«»
«»
«c2»Exploder, «c5»the coder of all these productions, uses a very special method.
He generates the samples (he programs the music - remake it) and also
he renderes the patterns. This has resulted in all the mentioned
productions.«»
«»
But the 12th of May last year, Exploder left to form his own crew.
He created «c2»Push Entertainment! «c5»So far he has entertained us all with two
stunning productions, the 4k intro called «c2»Humus «c5»and the 64k intro «c2»Incision.
«c5»This is «c2»russian aggression «c5»at its best! I hope the scene will experience
ALOT more from Exploder the next years.«»
«»
But with Exploder leaving, «c2»Extreme is in trouble «c5»as he was the main
coder force behind the amiga division of the group. The other members are
said to be not that skilled when it comes to coding, but the future will
tell. Anyway, these days Extreme are looking for new coders, so if you're
a good coder, then you shouldn't hesitate to contact them. Lets hope
that this team will continue «c2»giving joy «c5»to the amiga community.«»
