«c5»Nowadays, not many groups have a
person in their memberlist listed as
an «c2»organizer, «c5»although it was very
common in the old scene. Today, most
groups get by without, with their
coders being some sort of
semi-organizers, or the ones mostly in
charge. It is never wise giving the
coders too much power, however, hehe.
Most groups would benefit from having
a real organizer in them, and in this
article I will explain what uses an
organizer can have. Bad organizers are
ofcourse bad for the group, like bad
dictators are bad for a country, but 
good ones can really do a lot for the 
group.«»
«»
The «c2»function «c5»of an organizer is to
make the group work, both internal and
external. He tries to make the group
into one smooth, responsive unit, and
usually makes sure that the members
know and talk with eachother (unless
he wants them separated, in order to
better control them ofcourse).
Internally, he is the one «c2»arranging
meetings, updating the internal news
«c5»and occasionally even doing the
dishes. He also has the function of
«c2»kicking members and making new ones
join, «c5»and that is one of the most
important things in a group. Groups
without organizers usually have a
harder time kicking fellow members,
since they have to get together and
agree to kick one, and most people
don't want to kick their friends
regardless of how inactive they are,
thus a group gets bogged down with
inactive members nobody has the guts
to kick. An organizer on the other
hand, HAS to be able to kick people
without much regard for whether they
be friends or not, it is simply
business, and it is his first and
foremost duty to make the group
function well. This might sound cold 
and harsh, but afterall it is 
neccessary if you want an efficient 
group and don't have all the top 
sceners to work with in the group. On 
the other hand, making new members 
join is also a delicate affair. Some 
groups feel happy if a scener just 
asks them to join, and they don't 
think much farther than that, letting 
almost everybody who ask join. An 
organizer has to be extremely careful 
with this, only letting people who
are skilled, needed, active and fit 
into the group join, if one of these 
critierias isn't met, there will be 
some sort of trouble in the end. Most 
organizers have had this as a weak 
spot however, letting way too many
people join, without thinking about
the consequences.«» 
«»
As for «c2»productions, «c5»the organizer has
a say here too. Ideally, it would be
nice if the other members could
produce releases of their own
volition, but, depending on the group,
they might need some 'prodding' to
produce the stuff, so an organizer
looks at what members are ready for a
production, and try to make those
members do something, particularely
for an upcoming party or the like.
When the members are living close by,
the organizer can 'invite' them into
his home, to do some 'funny' work, and
not let them go before something has
been created. It is also the duty of
the organizer to actually release the
stuff, that is, decide where and when
to release things, and whether a
production is too unfinished/bad to be
released or not. This means that the
organizer has a lot of control about
how the group will seem like to the
external world, and if the organizer
isn't good enough, he can quickly ruin
the whole group, or atleast make sure
that it will never get popular.«» 
«»
All in all, most beginner and mediocre 
groups would «c2»benefit «c5»the most by
having an organizer, especially if
they have many members, while top
groups with few members function quite
well without any organizer, because
everybody knows eachother in such a
group, and everybody is active and
skilled. The goal of an organizer is
in a way a sad one, he works to make
himself superfluous, the goal is to
make the group work as a cohesive
unit, without need for leadership from
above. Most groups however, would
benefit from having a (good)
organizer. Organizers can be as
kings, really bad if they are not
skilled, really good if they are.
Democracy is highly overrated anyway,
it makes things so difficult, the
decisions take longer, and besides,
can you really trust the uneducated
masses to make the right decisions?
No, ofcourse you can't, so the time of
the organizer is not yet past, a group
can still benefit a lot from a good
organizer.«»

Ohh yeah, and I have naturally been 
entirely unbiased and objective in 
this article, ofcourse I'm no 
organizer myself, no no...«»
