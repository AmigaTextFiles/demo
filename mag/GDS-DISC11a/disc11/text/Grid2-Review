«c2»The 64k-Intro «c5»Grid2 «c2»done by «c5»Nature «c2»is the sequel to their 40k-intro
Grid which won the Mekka-Symposium party in 1999. As with Grid, Grid2
also won the intro competition... but this time at The Party 2000!«»
«»
The intro require at least AGA, a 68020 processor, FPU and 12mb fast
memory. But it's prefered to use a 68060 processor as the effects will
be faster, and with Oxypatcher the long precalculation will be faster also.«»
«»
The reason why I only choose to review this intro, is because it's the
only intro worthy to be reviewed after my opinion. It's in a class of its
own compared to the other intros presented at the Party. It seems like all
the other intros are more old-school intros, at least all the effects are
old and not done very well either. And it also seems like grey/black/white
intros are a trend. Anyway, I think many OLD 4k-intros could have beaten
any of the other 64k intros in this competition... like Extel/Ambrosia for
instance. It have to be said that all other intros presented at The Party
2000 work on "weaker" amigas, like a 020/28Mhz 4mb fast.«»

Oh well, lets continue with this short review of Grid 2!«»

The intro is made by:«»

«c2»There are two versions of Grid2, one which got presented at the «c5»Party 2000
«c2»and a fixed version which got released a few days later on.«»
«»
Before getting to see anything at all, we have to wait while the long
precalculation takes place. But then suddenly the fun starts. The letters
«c5»N A T U R E «c2»is slowly being showed as they enter the screen sideways. And
then «c5»G R I D 2 «c2»appears the same way. An ordinary 2d engine is used.«»
«»
Afterwards we're being introduced to the first real effect: something which
looks like a lightsourced vectorobject or flatline vectorobject with lots of flare-bobs (or
blurred bobs if you wish) moving in all directions in the background.«»
«»
We get to see something which appears like a picture waving routine, but
its more like a blurred tunnel. Then we get so see a wireframe tunnel with
changing objects inside and flare-bobs outside. Then another tunnel appears
and we're moving backwards and forwards. More wireframing and more objects
appear. We also get to see some very nice cubes, some cool transforming
objects I've never seen before and all with good camera movements.
Towards the end we get some see the credits being showed while some
wireframe objects appear in the background. And we also get to see some
wireframe objects which I choose to call them inside vector objects.
One very good intro which definately deserved to win the competition!!!
I think the 3d engine used with antialised lines, flat-polys and flare-blobs
is very good. Also the double-crossed raycast tunnel was enjoyable and all
with nice music.«»
«»
Anyway, taste reality... reading about eating a burger can never be
compared to actually eating it youself!!! So watch Grid 2 if you haven't
done it already. It's certainly one of the «c5»best intros «c2»presented last year!«»
