«c2»ShaneWolf is showtime 15 out yet?«»
TickleDKG shane: not till midnight apparently«»
ShaneWolf tickle: Midnight. Why?«»
ShaneWolf tickle: Modem refused my article cos he said it was finished.«»
TickleDKG shane: he has the charts to compile«»
ShaneWolf tickle: Okay. I expect to see my name all over them!!! :)«»
TickleDKG shane: well, i think you'll be disappointed then«»
ShaneWolf tickle: Ack! After everything I've done for the scene!«»
TickleDKG shane: which is what, exactly?«»
ShaneWolf tickle: All my groups intros and stuff.«»
Wavemaker which group?«»
ShaneWolf tickle: Maybe after we win Spoletium we will get more respekt!«»
ShaneWolf Wavemaker: Fearmoths!«»
TickleDKG shane: errr ... for shure ...«»
Wavemaker sorry, never heard about it«»
ShaneWolf tickle: Have you seen our Spol demo yet?«»
TickleDKG shane: no«»
ShaneWolf wavemaker: We have only released one intro (showtime promo) under this name so far.«»
ShaneWolf tickle: It's waff! Bomb Fire Night...look out for it!«»
Wavemaker oh that one. it crashed my miggy.«»
ShaneWolf wavemaker: Did it? COOL! hehe. I think it needs all the chip mem, I can only run it by booting without startup.«»
ShaneWolf 1st 100% hires intro for years I think.«»
Wavemaker hires?«»
ShaneWolf wavemaker: sorry, high resolution.«»
TickleDKG shane: yeah, but theres no effects in it :D«»
TickleDKG shane: just some colour cycling... wooo«»
[case]2   shane: you are the same that claimed to nbe trsi?«»
[case]2   ahah tickle«»
[case]2   shane: you are the same that claimed to be trsi?«»
ShaneWolf tickle: Effects are boring. Well, maybe a few would have been good. But The Various Slime Creep isn`t very good at fast routines.«»
ShaneWolf case: yep, I WAS in TRSI!«»
ShaneWolf Case: I explained it all in an article, but it won`t be released. :(«»
[case]2   the leader claim different«»
alive`    so was i, who cares :P«»
Wavemaker 'shane' not found«»
ShaneWolf tickle: But effects ain`t everything. It made its point and looked better than anything these days.«»
nic0      you cant be in trsi without the leader joining you in :)«»
ShaneWolf case:Leader? Warhead?«»
TickleDKG shane: send the article to magic_mi@dds.nl and it may make it to Dvn #2«»
TickleDKG "looked better than anything these day" ... classic«»
Wavemaker shane: you were in trsi under which handle?«»
TickleDKG hahaha«»
ShaneWolf nic0: Who joined the leader then?«»
TickleDKG ROTFL«»
nic0      ShaneWolf: what kinda lame question is that ?«»
TickleDKG "Who joined the leader" hahaha«»
TickleDKG this is classic... i'm gonna log this«»
ShaneWolf tickle: Okay. I will!! It's a great article, but I have to wait to release it.«»
nic0      im logging it«»
TickleDKG its well funny«»
nic0      it may be worth an article :)«»
ShaneWolf Wavemaker: Under Shanethewolfthedog. It was a disaster though.«»
TickleDKG shane: you are the best wind up merchant in the world.. i actually used to think you meant all this shit you say«»
TickleDKG almost as funny as when he asked to be in the eurocharts hahahaha«»
ShaneWolf tickle: What do you mean?«»
[case]2   nico :)«»
Wavemaker being in trsi is nothing to be proud of these days anyway.«»
[case]2   shane ask to be in eurochart?«»
ShaneWolf Tickle: Our products are cool. They're not about fast effects theyre about entertaining the audiences!«»
TickleDKG case: yeah! he asked darkhawk if he could be best coder or something and best group too«»
ShaneWolf Wave: I know. TRSI are lameasses!«»
[case]2   hahahahahahahaha«»
[case]2   tickle: shane want be the first EC pay member?«»
alive`    wave: you always say that...being in XXX is nothing these days...blah blah. :P«»
ShaneWolf Tickle: No I didn`t. That was a joke.«»
TickleDKG shane: well, you can't tell with you... you say such stupid stuff all the time ;)«»
ShaneWolf Tickle: Like what?«»
Wavemaker alive: if i said that before it was a joke. In this case it isn't, unless you're in the warez scene.«»
TickleDKG shane: ok... Stupid stuff said by shane.. a small selection:«»
ShaneWolf Tickle: But I do think I deserve to be in the chart somewhere. Perhaps low down.«»
TickleDKG "[the st15 promo] ... looked better than anything these days"«»
«c5»Quit TickleDKG (^rhas01072@212.187.142.137) has signed off (Connection reset by peer).«»
«c2»ShaneWolf I think it did. Everything around today is messy, blocky and has no colour or design.«»
ShaneWolf Come back tickle, I'm not through with you!«»
nic0      hehe...«»
Darkhawk  hehehe«»
nic0      stuff today DO have color and design«»
Darkhawk  messy, blocky and no colour or design.. interesting... ;D«»
nic0      because there is no new effects«»
ShaneWolf nic0: It does? Like what?«»
ShaneWolf Darkhawk: It's true! Well, I can`t say whether its the same for all those PPC and 060 demos, but whatever I see looks like crap.«»
nic0      ShaneWolf like what ?«»
nic0      do u ever watch demos ?«»
nic0      havent u noticed that noone just put in effects«»
nic0      u have to add design«»
ShaneWolf Nic0: I haven`t seen a demo with design for years!«»
nic0      ShaneWolf: then either you:«»
nic0      A) are lame«»
nic0      B) havent watched demos for years«»
nic0      C) are shitting us«»
ShaneWolf Nic0: Unless you call white fonts over an effect design. :P«»
[case]2   C) are blind«»
[case]2   E) have a black/white monitor«»
ShaneWolf Well, DCS and HJB did some cool looking intros a while ago, but thats about all I can think of.«»
«c5»--> TickleDKG (^rhas01072@212.187.166.210) has joined this channel.«»
«c2»TickleDKG damn it«»
ShaneWolf Oi Tickle. Where did you run off to?«»
speeedo   asiaa«»
TickleDKG anyway... as i was quoting...«»
TickleDKG "After everything i've done for the scene!!"«»
TickleDKG "Who joined the leader?"«»
TickleDKG "I deserve to be in the chart...."«»
TickleDKG "Can i be best coder?"«»
TickleDKG superb«»
TickleDKG you should be a professional comedian :D«»
ShaneWolf Tickle: The best coder remark was a joke, but I stand by the rest!«»
[case]2   tickle: they are a best lamer chat?«»
[case]2   tickle: they are a best lamer chart?«»
TickleDKG i love the way you delude yourself into thinking you're single handedly saving the scene... :)«»
speeedo   lamerchat«»
ShaneWolf tickle: Well I'm the only one who innovates new things. It might be amateur, but its better than watching the latest doom rip off.«»
TickleDKG "innovates new things" wow... you're on form tonight«»
craid^hjb ..ohh... il signore speedo.. :))«»
[case]2   hehe tickle«»
TickleDKG its like you just havent noticed that all your intros arent actually any good ;)«»
Wavemaker the latest doom rip off? you mean quake 3? ;)«»
ShaneWolf Tickle: I admit they aren`t totally professional, but they are original and more entertertaining than anything else.«»
TickleDKG i've released some drivel in my life, but at least i admit if somethings crap its crap ;)«»
ShaneWolf wavemaker: Well actually I mean Wolfenstein, talking as an 030 owner.«»
ShaneWolf I watched a demo from TRSAC the other day - by Apathy - and it was all in grey and so slow!«»
BoostrLns from apathy?«»
TickleDKG yeah, apathy have released some shit... but they have released some gems also«»
TickleDKG AHA is kewl«»
nic0      ShaneWolf you stink :)«»
Wavemaker apathy released a demo at trsac?«»
ShaneWolf Grey can look stylish (see our spol demo) but that...erk«»
nic0      there was no demo from apathy at trsac«»
BoostrLns correct.«»
ShaneWolf tickle: I can`t remember, I delete stuff which I already have duplicates of.«»
TickleDKG yeah, thats true«»
Darkhawk  True enough that it was in greay and slow«»
Darkhawk  But t was from Loonies«»
nic0 hehe Darkhawk :)«»
BoostrLns darkhawk, haha«»
Darkhawk  And it won over our fine demo, tsk, tsk ;)«»
ShaneWolf Loonies stuff never runs on my 030«»
TickleDKG Loonies? hahahaaha«»
BoostrLns ShaneWolf, needs fpu«»
lahveRSN  ShaneWolf: congrats for showtime15 promo, it`s great i think«»
TickleDKG shane: The loonies demo was totally better than any of your releases«»
ShaneWolf boostr: I don`t have one. :(«»
lahveRSN  BoostrLns: i will have 060 soon :)«»
BoostrLns lahveRSN, supergreat mane!«»
Darkhawk  tickle: Hey, you have watched our demo I hope? :)«»
TickleDKG shane: and it was actually innovative ;)«»
BoostrLns ShaneWolf, well there you have your reason ;o)«»
ShaneWolf Lahve: Thanks my friend! Its the first positive comment I've had! :)«»
lahveRSN  ShaneWolf: really?«»
TickleDKG darkhawk: of course, it was good too«»
TickleDKG shane: hey, i thought it was a good gesture... but i wouldn't want to run it ever again«»
ShaneWolf lahve: Everyone hates my stuff.«»
lahveRSN  ShaneWolf: i didn`t like your previous stuff, but that promo seems to be good«»
TickleDKG shane: yeah, the ST15 promo was an improvement«»
ShaneWolf lahve: Thanks. I admit it lacks effects though and I think the music is a bit weird.«»
ShaneWolf tickle: That was one of our more serious intros I guess.«»
TickleDKG shane: and i was pleased you managed to avoid using Speak2Sample ;]«»
ShaneWolf tickle: hehe, but that program is SOOOOO COOOL! Amiga speech rocks!«»
Wavemaker djinky: exotica.fix.no , in the editors section«»
ShaneWolf Tickle: I have used it in our spol demo, but only for the end bit.«»
TickleDKG shane: yeah, i love say, but it doesnt mean that it worked when you used it in your prods.«»
TickleDKG shane: it just made a bad intro irritating«»
ShaneWolf tickle: Well, its actually Uncle Boose who uses it. But maybe he will get a sampler one day.«»
ShaneWolf I want a digimatizer too!«»
TickleDKG booster: no, go to mekka =]«»
ShaneWolf And a camcorder so I could make movies!«»
TickleDKG i have a Vidi Amiga 12 :-p«»

ShaneWolf The problem with vidi 12 is you need a good pause on your video or itt won`t do colour.«»
BoostrLns in 5 fps«»
ShaneWolf You just reminded me, I think I have a picture of myself somewhere......«»
ShaneWolf I will have to send it to EC for the gallery!«»
