«c1»INTRODUCTION«»
«»
«c2»Hi Punisher and welcome to the D.I.S.C. H.Q. building! I hope you're
sitting comfortable and enjoying your drink while answering these few
questions...«»
«»
«c5»I'm fine thank you!«»
«»
«c2»As a short introduction, please tell the readers a few words about
yourself, your function and what you want to achieve in the scene?«»
«»
«c5»My name is Jonas O'Brien and I'm 19 years old. I'm studying history on the
university in Bergen, and I find it nice. I live in my own apartment in
this city, as I moved away from my parents a half year ago. Regarding the
scene part, I'm an editor and a swapper. On the scene I want to make
friends and have a nice time in general!«»
«»
«c2»When did you enter the scene and how did you first get attracted to it?«»
«»
«c5»1995. This year I entered the scene. I had seen some old productions, and I
found it very interesting. I started searching around, and I got even more
demos. I also got hold some diskmags and after a while, I was hooked. I had
to become apart of this fantastic community! I also looked up to those that
had adverts in packs and other productions, and those who could manage to
code demos. I wanted to be like them, and I guess I still will be.«»
«»
«c1»GROUPS«»
«»
«c2»You have been in quite many groups, I can mention Complex Quantity,
The Demon Project, EMS Design, Rape, Xfactor, Alien Industries, Instinct,
Absurd, Mantra, Mad Wizards, RNO, Veezya, Apathy and Void.
Do you plan to stay in DarkAge and Nah-Kolor for long? This question just had
to come, hehe...«»
«»
«c5»At the moment I'm quite satisfied with only being a member of Darkage and
Nah-Kolor. I don't think that I will team up with any new groups for a long
while, but you can never tell. If the right people comes up with the right
proposals, it could be that I will join them. However, no one can predict
the future!«»
«»
«c2»What do you think are the good and bad sides of your groups?«» 
«»
«c5»Hehe.. Funny that you should ask me this question. A couple of days ago I
talked with Ghandy about the current situation in Darkage, and it was
exactly this topic we were discussing. You see, that I have had some
problems with being in regular contact with the members of Darkage. This is
mostly because of my lack of internet access. At the moment everyone that
is a member of Darkage have this, and only Zito is swapping, so it is quite
hard to get the necessary information regarding recent happenings. This
situation will change though, as Ghandy have promised to update me as often
as possible. Overall, the situation in Darkage is very positive and I 've
got a lot of friends here. Zito, Ghandy, Modem and others are friendly guys
which I love with all of my heart!«»
«»
When it comes to Nah-Kolor, I really don't have anything to complain about.
I'm often in touch with the organizer, which is Magic, and things are
working out very well. The only thing I feel that is not working properly
is the updating of the homepage and that I'm registrated as an Hungarian
member in the newsfile. How could the manage to do a mistake like this?
Anyway, Nah-Kolor is a nice groups, and I find it exciting to be a part of
it.«»
«»
«c2»Are you content in those groups?«»
«»
«c5»Yes.«»
«»
«c2»How important do you think it is for a group to have a good organizing
and real friendship between the members?«»
«»
«c5»It is very, very important, as friendship is the ground fundament of the
scene. Without friendship, the scene would die. In a group it is very
important to have a well established friendship between the members, as the
will co-operate better and give eachother more motivation for producing
various stuff. Also, to have a good organizer means just as much, as you
need someone to keep track of all the changes and to give the resepective
members different tasks. Without proper organizing, the group will fall
apart and die. I have experienced that myself.«»
«»
«c2»Yes, you were the organizer of Instinct. Why did that group fade away?«»
«»
«c5»There were some conflicts between the members. Also, renaming the group to
Mantra and then to kick some of the old members, caused the group to slowly
decline. I take the full responsibility. Anyway, it could be that Instinct
will be back soon.. With many new members..«»
«»
«c2»You're a double-member, what do you think of double (triple etc.)
membership? And what's the point with being a double-member?«»
«c5»I think it is ok. I see nothing wrong with being a member of different
groups. It creates variety and that is very positive. We get more groups
and we get more productions. What is wrong with that? Also, the loyality
will be just as high, as one in most cases got friends in all the groups
one are a member of.«»
«»
«c2»What's your all-time favourite group? And why?«»
«»
«c5»My all-time favourite group is IRIS. I have seen many good productions from
this group, and I have always been fascinated by their image. I'm still
admiring IRIS, and I think I will do that for ever. Such a crew does for
sure deserve some higher rankings on the charts!«»
«»
«c1»SWAPPING:«»
«»
«c2»What do you like about swapping?«»
«»
«c5»The feeling of seeing four-five envelopes in your mailbox is close to
reaching an orgasm. Since the first day I received something from a friend,
I've been addicted! I wanted more! The excitement that occurs when open a
package and read the letter can't be described in words. Also, the most
important part is the friendship. You gain new friends all around the world
and many of them will be your pals for ever! To be honest, I think that
it is easier to become close friends through swapping than e-mail writing.«»
«»
«c2»Aren't you sometimes tired of it all?«»
«»
«c5»Hehe.. Well, there have been times that I have been completely exhausted
because of too many sendins coming in. Sometimes I have had huge
difficulties managing to cope with the stream of letters, but then I have
taken a little break to get some rest, and when I get back, I find it more
fun than ever! Also, who can get tired of getting lovely letters with
interesting content?«»
«»
«c2»Have you ever made a rankinglist of your contacts in one way or another?«»
«»
«c5»Yep, of course, I have filled out votesheets. Beside this, I have made a
list over my fastest contacts once. I didn't get much response on it
though, so I stopped doing it.«»
«»
«c2»How many active contacts do you have?«»
«»
«c5»Hmm.. I don't actually remember, but it should be over 100. Earlier I have
had over 140 active ones, but that is one and a half, two years ago.«»
«»
«c2»Is this too much or too few?«»
«c5»I want more, no question about that. Of course it takes time, but it is my
main hobby beside writing short stories and novels, so why not?«»
«»
«c2»What do you think of the fact that some productions are only spread
by snailmail, from swapper to swapper?«»
«»
«c5»I think that is a good idea, but it also has some negative aspects. I think
the scene should be united and not apart, and therefore I think that it
would be better if everyone had the possibility of seeing productions being
released. I mean, coders doesn't always have time to swap!«»
«»
«c2»Do you consider yourself as a friendship or elite swapper?«»
«»
«c5»I consider myself as a friendship swapper. I don't like the term elite
swapper, as the scene is not the same as I have heard it was back in the
old, but not necessary better, days. I mean, the people who are swapping
these days are into it for friendship and not only for stuff.«»
«»
«c2»What do you think about nowadays swapping scene? And what about the
norwegian swappers... are there any?«»
«»
«c5»Nowadays swapping scene is currently very good. This year, we have seen
many new people entering our community, and this is people from Norway,
Sweden, Germany, Bulgaria, The Czech Republic and Poland. A little bit
funny is it that people who has inet access starts swapping. They tell me
that they think swapping is a great tradition and it deserves to stay
alive. Also they tell me that it is overall more friendship orientated, and
the really love that part. When it comes to swappers in Norway, we have a
few, but not too many. Some new swappers have joined this year, but the
recruitiment could be better! This counts for other parts of the scene too,
so..«»
«»
«c2»Out of these new swappers you mention, how many have you gotten this year?«»
«»
«c5»About 15 I think.«»
«»
«c2»What do you prefer, having many contacts and writing short and more
standard letters but getting very hot stuff
or only a few contacts with long friendly letters and not so hot stuff?«»
«»
«c5»Friendly letters and not so hot stuff. Why? Friendship rulez.«»
«»
«c2»What do you think about the following packs:«»
«»
«c6»Speed/Nah-Kolor:«»
«»
«c5»Speed is a nice pack, but I want say anymore about it as I'm a member of
Nah-Kolor myself.«»
«»
«c6»Frozenpack/Whelpz:«»
«»
«c5»The best pack on the scene these days. Lot's of stuff to read, good updated
news and adverts section and always hot stuff.«»
«»
«c6»Overtime/Moons:«»
«»
«c5»Overtime is an ok pack featuring different stuff to read. It is a little
while since it last was released, but that is probably because they are
working on new layout and code.«»
«»
«c6»Sabotage/Reason:«»
«»
«c5»This is the best forum for swappers these days. If one wants to know what
is going on in our community, then one can aquire Sabotage from a swapper
and read like hell! It is a great production and I love it! The compiler
Lahve/Mad Wizards+Reason is a nice guy and completely hyperactive. It is
people like him we need to keep the scene alive and kicking!«»
«»
«c6»Zosia/Mawi:«»
«»
«c5»Zosia is a great piece of work. MCR/Appendix+Mad Wizards who is behind it
have done a good job with this production. It could have been released more
regularly though.«»
«»
«c6»Influencepack/Absurd:«»
«»
«c5»Only three issues have been released, but this is because it is a fairly
new pack. The mag section is not very good, and improvement could be done
here.«»
«»
«c6»Dreams/Apathy:«»
«»
«c5»This is my old pack, I will therefore take the liberty to not say anything
about it. Sorry!«»
«»
«c6»Avatar/IRIS:«»
«»
«c5»Avatar has not been released for a while, and I don't like it that much. I
think the graphics looks bad, and it should be updated. The mag part has
also been totally unuseful when thinking of the last two issues.«»
«»
«c6»Embrion/Veezya:«»
«»
«c5»A good chippack which often contains nice tunes to listen to. The magpart
is always up to date thanks to the compiler, Kempy/Veezya. A good
production which I would like to tell everyone reading this to check out!«»
«»
«c6»Save Da Vinyl/Mawi:«»
«»
«c5»A nice musicpack. I like it!«»
«»
«c6»Digital Chips/Apathy:«»
«»
«c5»Maze/Apathy rocks with his chiptunes. He is a very good musician! Although,
it could be released more often.«»
«»
«c6»Feedback/Apathy:«»
«»
«c5»I remember receving the first issue of Feedback right before the summer of
1996. It was a great experience and I really enjoyed it. Since then I have
always been looking forward to new issues of this pack! Strife/Apathy, the
compiler, is doing a great job with this production.«»
«»
«c1»THE SCENE«»
«»
«c2»Do you remember the first demo you saw and mag you read?«»
«»
«c5»The first demo I saw was Budbrain Megademo I. It simply rocked with many
funny animations. I loved it, and spent a lot of time with my friends
watching the "Hustler" section. The "Elvis Ride" for old women was
fascinating.. Hehe.. The first mag must be "Headline" from Stone Arts. I
remember I was very fascinated about the handles they used and I wondered
what the hell this community was about. It changed me for ever I think.«»
«»
«c2»What do you think are the good and bad sides of the scene?«»
«»
«c5»The good sides must definatly be the friendship aspect. Other good things
are of course the enjoyment of productions released and of course that one
belongs to a community with cool people! Bad sides?! None!!«»
«»
«c2»Tell us your favourite sceneproduction of all time?«»
«»
«c5»"Technological Death" by Mad Elks. This production really rocks! Also, a
second one is reading the old "Gedan" diskmag.«»
«»
«c2»Well, it's time to find out what's your taste and then go in the "depths"
so to speak. What's your favorite:«»

«»
«»
«c2»Please tell your opinion about the future of the scene:«»
«»
«c4»OPTIMISTIC: «c5»No lamers at parties, Amiga will rule and thousands will join
            the scene!«»
«»
«c4»REALISTIC:  «c5»Some people will join, some people will leave, status quo«»
«»
«c4»PESIMISTIC: «c5»More overall laziness due to various reasons«»
«»
«»
«c2»And what do you think about the latest Amiga plans?«»
«»
«c5»Don't know much about them, but after what I've heard, they looks
promising.«»
«»
«c2»Do you picture yourself in the scene when you're an old man such as me? ;)«»
«»
«c5»Yes. It is not THAT easy leaving the scene.. Once you are inside, you need
help to get out! HEEELP!!!!«»
«»
«c1»MAGS«»
«»
«c2»As you're also an editor, what do you think about the various mags around:«»
«»
«c4»EuroChart: «c5»The official Eurochart. No doubt about it. Too bad some people
           don't bother filling out the votesheet for it.«»
«»
«c4»ShowTime: «c5»I like Showtime very much, as the articles are always
          entertaining, and what's just as important, the chart has often
          more votes than Eurochart.«»
«»
«c4»Devotion: «c5»A good mag, but unfortunatly with old news and almost no adverts.«»
«»
«c4»D.I.S.C.: «c5»I've only seen a preview, and in my opinion, it looks quite good.«»
«»
«c2»And what do you think about the Polish mags, like Taboo, Beret and Excess?«»
«»
«c5»I can't really say much about the Polish mags, since I'm not capable of
reading Polish text. However, graphically they look very nice. Also, the
contain plenty of articles and other support. If the Poles had released
them in English language they would be a major threat to all of the
established Western mags.«»
«»
«c2»Are there too few mags around after your opinion?«»
«»
«c5»Yes, there are room for many, many more! Of all stuff, I like to receive
diskmags most, and I think this counts for almost every scener. Let us hope
that some new mags will arrive in 2001!«»
«c2»Do mags have any influence in the scene?«»
«»
«c5»They have an influence in making people interested in what is going on in
our community, informing them of the latest happenings, make them able to
take part in discussions, and most important, it keeps the scene together.«»
«»
«c2»What do you think about the various charts in todays mags?«»
«»
«c5»Charts are chart. Nothing more to say about it. If more people could bother
filling out votesheets, they could be bigger and more reliable too!«»
«»
«c2»You are a major supporter of alot of packs, mags etc. Can you mention
which you have supported reguarly?«»
«»
«c5»When it comes to packs, I have supported Speed/Nah-Kolor, Sabotage/Reason,
Feedback/Apathy, Zosia/Mad Wizards, Digital Chips/Apathy, Embrion/Veezya,
Red Pack/Red Bullz, Influencepack/Absurd, Dreams/Apathy, Implant/Apathy and
some others I can't remember at this moment.«»
«»
I have also supported some mags. Showtime/Darkage, Eurochart/IRIS,
Norsktoppen/Instinct, Retro/Instinct and Excess/Mad Wizards«»
«»
«c2»The latest news is that you've become a co-editor of ShowTime together
with Ghandy, Dreyer and The Hooligan with Zito as the main-ed. Will you
now concentrate more on that mag and less on others?«»
«»
«c5»Well, I will of course continue to support all the ones I'm a supporter
for, but Showtime will occupy most of my time.«»
«»
«c1»HIDDEN SKILLS:«»
«»
«c2»You've also been coding a couple of productions... can you mention which
ones, and tell the readers more about them?«»
«»
«c5»No! Please! Not this question. I feared that you would ask me about this.
Damn, what shall I say? I have coded some productions, but they are not
very good. The only one I'm very satisfied with it "Stob Bombing Serbia"
which was a protest against NATO and USA bombing my friends in this
country. However, I'm still coding a bit in my sparetime. Right now I'm
working on a demo featuring some more up-to-date effects and I'm 98%
finished with a pack for my friend, Malmis/Void. So, I won't tell you
much about what I have released earlier. It is not worth mentioning.
Sorry! ;)«»
«»
«c2»You're currently working on a few more productions. Can you please tell
us something about it?«»
«»
«c5»The pack I'm coding on will be called "Saxonia" and will be released under
the Void label. It will feature a scroller at the bottom of the screen,
graphics by Malmis/Void, a copperbar-scroller behind in the selection
screen and many secret and funny parts. You can actually enter an own
screen where you can write your handle, and then you will get a message. I
think it will be fun to release it!«»
«»
The demo I'm working on is nothing special, but it is probably the best one
I've ever made. At the time of writing it contains some more new-school
effects in combination with nice graphics. I won't tell you anything more.
You will see when it will be released.«»
«»
«»
«»
«c1»REAL LIFE:«»
«»
«c2»What's your occupation?«»
«»
«c5»I'm a student at the university in Bergen. At this place I'm studying
history.«»
«»
«c2»Tell us about one of your normal days...«»
«»
«c5»My normal day? First I get up and eat breakfeast, and then I smoke some
cigarettes and drink coffee together with the guy I'm sharing an apartment
together with. Afterwards I check out the mailbox, and most often, I
receive some packages. Then I check the packages and copy the stuff onto my
harddrive. Then I get off to the university to learn something needed for
my exams. In the evenings I often relax at home, reading, sitting with my
computer or have some friends with me. I also spend some time downtown with
my friends, and that is cool. Of course, I use a lot of time on scening!«»
«»
«c2»Do you have any other hobbies than computing? In that case, which?«»
«»
«c5»Writing is one of my biggest hobbies. As I've said earlier, I have released
some short stories and I'm working on two novels. I also like to watch
videos, listen to music and such. Earlier I played bass in band, but after
I moved away from my old city, this is impossible. «»
«»
«c2»I understand you're working on a book project, what's it all about?«»
«»
«c5»Ok, I'm working on two projects, not one. The first one is about a person
in his best age experiencing all that life has to offer. He is a little bit
similar to me and have done many mistakes I've done personally. What's
important to notice, is that I have used characteristics of people from
real life. Which in other terms means that some my friends will be
included. Not in full perspective of course.. The other one is about a man
that gets dragged to the bottom of life, and has no hope left. He is being
destroyed from the outside, and his inside rottens. It is quite brutal, and
if you are faint hearted you shouldn't read it. It also features erotic
sections.«»
«»
«c2»What kind of music and movies do you enjoy?«»
«»
«c5»I like heavy-metal. Bands like Iron Maiden, Anthrax, Megadeth, Manowar,
Helloween, Hammerfall, W.A.S.P and Blind Guardian means a lot to me. Also I
like listening to Hardcore, especially Integrity and Strife. Sometimes I
can also find myself enjoying some rock'n'roll from the fifties and last
but not least, Samantha Fox. This women is beutiful! ;)«»
«»
«c2»Thanks for spending alot of your time here answering these questions. Good
luck with future plans... Now you can write whatever you would like, like
greetings etc.«»
«»
«c5»Greetings must go to my contacts and all other friends. To Zerox/Gods I
would like to say that I became really happy when you decided to interview
me. Have a happy new year!«»
