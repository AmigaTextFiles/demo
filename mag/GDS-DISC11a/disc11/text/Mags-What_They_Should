MAGS - WHAT TO CALL THEM?«»
«»«ac»
«c3»BY ZEROX/GODS«»
«as»«»
«c5»There are lots of mags, or at least there have been lots of mags around.
If I say there are 5 active mags with regular releases, then I would
rather exaggerate than underestimate the scene I guess. Anyway, this is
not the theme of this article. The topic is the different names of some
selected mags which «c2»the D.I.S.C. team «c5»have taken a closer look at.
Why do the main-editor of a mag choose THAT spesific «c2»NAME? «c5»Has it a secret
message? Or is it just another stupid name taken from real publications
or from other places? Perhaps the name just poped up a night after 48 hours
non-stop amiga activities? Those questions and more will not be answered in
this article. However, we will try to find out «c5»what the mags really SHOULD
have been called!«»

«c4»Bigoz «c6»- Big Zoo«»
«»
«c1»It's easier for us non-Polish sceners to understand a mag with the name
Big Zoo than Bigoz. Big Zoo would also reflect the scene in a much more
accurate way we would say...«» 
«»
«»
«c4»Deadlock «c6»- Deadmeat«»
«»
«c1»Deadlock could be the right name if the main-ed has deadlock on the mag
itself, but for common sceners it's easier to remember a name like deadmeat
which describe the mag alot better.«»
«»
«»
«c4»Defy «c6»- Deny«»
«»
«c1»When thinking of the fact that this mag comes from Australia - a country
with a more or less hidden scene xxx miles away from the rest of the
sceners, it got to hard to produce something very interesting for the
european sceners. Until now the european scene has denied Defy, and therefore
the obvious name should be Deny.«»
«»
«»
«c4»Devotion «c6»- Desolation«»
«»
«c1»With having one main-editor without internet access, and the other only having
a PC the latest 4 years, we were very tempted to write Desolation. But rumours
are indicating that we have gone too far this time. So we will of course reconsider
and come up with a better suggestion later on...«»

«c4»D.I.S.C. «c6»- Do Insult Sceners Continuesly«»
«»
«c1»After the new style presented in the last issue of D.I.S.C. and the later
articles produced by the D.I.S.C. Team, the mag should definately stand for
Do Insult Sceners Continuesly instead of Digital Information Service for
Computerfreaks since both the service and the computerfreaks have disappered,
and because new and more aggressive directives have been given.«»
«»
«»
«c4»Friendchip «c6»- Professionals«»
«»
«c1»Friendship is out, and going professional is in. The makers of this mag
should know this. The friendship has been gone along time ago and more
and more are going professional. Time to change...«»
«»
«»
«c4»Generation «c6»- The Next Generation.«»
«»
«c1»If you watch Star Trek - The Next Generation, you have probably noticed
alot of 'wise' words, like 'My mind is going...  I can feel it.'. It's
the same if you read Generation, you loose your mind... and get the mind
of another? Perhaps you become a lunatic or simply think the mag is
marvellous...«»
«»
«»
«c4»Grapevine «c6»- Juice«»
«»
«c1»This mag haven't been released for quite some time. Rumours are saying that
the makers use some kind of drugs... I think it was LSD or something. Some are
claiming there will come more vine, and especially grapevine. But we fear all
that's left these days are juice...«»
«»
«»
«c4»Hokus Pokus «c6»- Missing Magic«»
«»
«c1»This mag needs more than some magic formula to make it big. Even if the
creators think so, there is no Hokus Pokus with making a mag... the magic
is missing.«»
«»
«»
«c4»Insomnia «c6»- Intermission«»
«»
«c1»After only 3 issues released the main-ed Shade left the scene, so of course
he won't suffer under insomnia anymore... If he returns he can once again
forget to 'Sleep Well', but until then the mag won't be out - it suffers under
intermission.«»
«»
«»
«»
«»
«c4»Jurassic Pack «c6»- The Lost Pack«»
«»
«c1»7 issues of the pack has been released and until now none can actually
remember the packpart. Jurassic has always been a mag, and a packpart have
been released at the same time a few times, but that was a totally other
pack. So Jurassic Pack should have been called The Lost Pack.«»
«»
«»
«c4»Miracle «c6»- 8th Wonder«»
«»
«c1»It would be more than a miracle to make a swappers mag when the swappers
have disappear... we would more say it could be the 8th wonder of the
world if this becomes reality.«»
«»
«»
«c4»No Sense «c6»- No Scene«»
«»
«c1»Perhaps the mag makes no sense, but it should be more correct to call it
No Scene as the scene is getting smaller and smaller, and most likely
will fade a way sooner or later. A No(ne) scene mag will be the answer
if you want to write forever...«»
«»
«»
«c4»Oepir Risti «c6»- 25«»
«»
«c1»25 is a suitable name for this mag. No one understands the name Oepir Risti
nor the weird mag itself either for that matter. The makers go their own
way, and that could be good. Why the name 25 then? Well, it's the number
or articles for each issue...  and also the number of mags listed here.«»

«c4»Official EuroChart «c6»- Fame«»
«»
«c1»Hmm... you wonder why we were thinking about renaming this old legend
to Fame? Well... the mag haven't got many votes lately, and it can't
exactly be called official either. In addition to that, the charts are
not limited only to Europe. The things that are for sure though, are that
the gallery usually are filled with pictures from the people behind the
mag. The only name that covers it all, is Fame... ;)«»
«»
«»
«c4»Pressure «c6»- Under Pressure«»
«»
«c1»This mag should definately be called Under Pressure instead of just
pressure. It's quite obvious that there are lots of editors under
pressure in that mag...  hopefully they will deliever their wares.«»
«»
«»
«c4»Rage! «c6»- Age!«»
«»
«c1»You have heard about the raging staff, but have you heard about the aging
staff...? Thinking about how long some of the sceners have been here,
it's more accurate to talk about aging than raging. None of the men behind
Rage! are furious, but they are all ageing...«»
«»
«»
«c4»R.A.W. «c6»- W.A.R.«»
«»
«c1»R.A.W. was suppose to stand for Revolutionary Article Work, but a long the
way the directives disappered and new appeared. We got articles about
Tip & Mantronic and Stalin, so naturely the mag should have been called
W.A.R. - We Are Rude.«»
«»
«»
«c4»R.O.M. «c6»- Read Obscene Manipulation«»
«»
«c1»If M.O.P. stands for Master Of Puppets then it's only natural that his mag
stands for Read Obscene Manipulation. The mag manipulates the reader to
believe the articles are objective, correct and don't have a more hidden
meaning. Only the master knows the truth...«»
«»
«»
«c4»SeenPoint «c6»- ScenePoint«»
«»
«c1»We were actually tempted to write No Point as we haven't actually Seen
the Point with this mag quitting when it was at the top. In any case,
it's more or less scene related and should be called ScenePoint, FishPoint,
SeenWave or something similar.«»
«»
«»
«c4»ShowTime «c6»- No Time«»
«»
«c1»ShowTime is often accused of having few articles, and the reason could
be no time, or the opposite of know how... perhaps it's a no show? It's
hard to say. We feel that they have been wrongly accused, and under big
doubts allow this headline to be included.«»
«»
«»
«c4»Silezia «c6»- Silent«»
«»
«c1»Silezia has been totally silent for a long time, so why not rename or
simply don't care at all...«»
«»
«»
«c4»The Jungle «c6»- Lost In The Jungle«»
«»
«c1»The staff have still not found the way out of the Jungle, and are totally
lost...«»
«»
«»
«c4»Trashcan «c6»- Spanish Lullabye«»
«»
«c1»After several issues of this mag, it's too hard to judge the mag down in
the trashcan. Perhaps we will get more issues of this mag, until then...
we choose to call the mag Spanish LullaBYE...«»
«»
«»
«c4»Upstream «c6»- Mainstream«»
«»
«c1»It became more and more obvious that this mag became the mainstream, or
should I say went with the mainstream? Some waves appeared and the mag
went with the mainstream and disappeared...«»
«»
«»
«c5»The conclusion can only be... «c2»change name «c5»before the name changes you.
Wise words. Anyway, this was the result after nearly 6 years of real hard &
serious studies and deep analysis of the mags above. We really hope that
you have come to the same conclusions... if not, we don't «c2»deserve «c5»our
name...«»
