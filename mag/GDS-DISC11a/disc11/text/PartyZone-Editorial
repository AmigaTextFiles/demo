«c5»In every issue of D.I.S.C. we bring you the latest party results, and some
party-reports. This time we have a HUGE section with results from all kind
of parties. In addition to that, we have the ordinary party guide. We just
noticed that we didn't include the results from FuckYanica One held the
6-7th of January, but we can at least inform you that Kangooroo won the
64k intro competition with their Flow PPC intro. Hopefully we have included
most of the other results from the important amiga parties held the last
half year or so.«»
