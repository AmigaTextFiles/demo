«c1»In the name of the sheep - Group-Interview with LOONIES«»

«as»«»
«c2»Welcome to the first group interview probably ever done in the irc. Well,
groupinterviews have their pros and cons. You have all interesting people
gathered at one channel and have the possibility to ask your questions to
anyone of them or just public and the person that feels that he should say
something, replies. On the contrary, more than three chatters at the same
channel surely causes pure chaos! Everybody`s spontaneously typing what
comes in his mind and at the end the reader won`t get the point.«»
«»
Why an interview with these danish guys? Quite simple! After releasing
the asskicking intro «c5»IMPOSSIBLE, «c2»the great «c5»CYBERCINEMATASTIC «c2»and the
polka-styled «c5»ARLA «c2»in such a short time, the danish «c5»Loonies «c2»became one of
the pillars of the Amiga demoscene. We in «c5»D.I.S.C «c2»don`t only want to see back
into the past where of course everything was better. We`ll try our best
to show that there`s still a Scene worth working for and who makes this
Scene being what it is. And thinking about that topic, the name Loonies first
came into my mind.«»
«»
So read on why the wellknown introgroup Focus Design had to die, what is going
on in the northern Scene and which mystery stands behind the mindblowing
success of these fellows. Also, read on what they generally think about diskmags
(this might me hard but quite honestly) and what motivations people can have to
join the international crew Scoopex. It might be good to understand the dansk
language as Booster, Psycho, Farfar, Bifrost and Laika posted the one or other
danish note inside the chat.«»

<Ghandy>     COOL STORYBOARD!!«»

<Ghandy>     I love MATIX!!! yeahh.. that movie is SOOOOO GREAT!«»

<LaikaLns>   it was a living hell on earth«»
<Bifrost>    Its hard for the coders when graphicians come up with wild crazy ideas ;)«»
<PsychoLns>  the matrix effect was done entirely down there... we had a vcd with the movie, and we saw it almost hundreds of time, before we knew how to do it ;)«»
<Ghandy>     I guess it`s very hard to animate people acting. I remember a demo from Limited Editon that has similar action but it`s not that good...«»
<Ghandy>     Psycho:haha!«»
<LaikaLns>   i animated  it in lightwave«»
<Ghandy>     how long did you take?«»
<LaikaLns>   and I can tell you now that it wasn't made for it«»
<LaikaLns>   it tok me about 2 months«»
<Ghandy>     ohh..that`s very, very long!!«»
<Ghandy>     Not that I could do it, but writing an article doesn`t take 2 months.. hehe«»
<Bifrost>    for me it does ;)«»
<Bifrost>    2 years even :)«»
<PsychoLns>  it's difficult to make that kind of dynamic action.. not like a man walking etc...«»
<Ghandy>     Psycho:YEah that`s what I think.. it`s way harder this way you`ve done!«»
<LaikaLns>   well , it didn,t  take like  hours  a day«»
<Bifrost>    Actually that scene was also altered a bit in the favour of the coders ;)«»
<PsychoLns>  LaikaLns: not 2 months.. maybe we had lots of scrapped attemps, but the one used in the demo was done in the last week up to the party«»
<Ghandy>     Bifrost:how was it altered?«»
<PsychoLns>  Bifrost: which one«»
<Bifrost>    It should have been like the fighting scenes from the matrix«»
<Bifrost>    PsychoLns: the lightsaber battle«»
<LaikaLns>   well, i triyed«»
<Ghandy>     Bifrost:Shooting etc.? or more karate-like?«»
<PsychoLns>  Ghandy: animation stopping, while the camera moves around«»
<Bifrost>    yep«»
<Ghandy>     ahh..okay«»
<LaikaLns>   yes , thats it«»
<Ghandy>     SOMETHING ELSE:HOW MANY SHEEPS WERE HARMED DURING THIS INTERVIEW? :-)) How did you get the idea with the sheep in every demo??«»
<LaikaLns>   it is a long story«»
<PsychoLns>  actually I think that animation is one of the weeker points in the demo... but it's mostly because we didn't have enough animation frames, so it runs kind of slowmo«»
<Bifrost>    psycho?`:)«»
<PsychoLns>  tarmslyng is the man to ask ;)«»
<Ghandy>     who?«»
<PsychoLns>  I think it comes from the Baah! sound (the one from worms actually), which is our official sound :)«»
<PsychoLns>  musician and cofounder«»
<PsychoLns>  tarmslyng made a entire module out of that song at TP96, and since then it has evolved I think«»
<Ghandy>     In every prod of you I`m waiting for the sheep to come.. hehe«»
<PsychoLns>  actually the sheep thing itself isn't much more than a year old, beginning with the Sheep Dictionary at Scene meeting 99«»
<LaikaLns>   well, you can call it a trend«»
<Ghandy>     A sheep dictionary?? What the heck is that?«»

<LaikaLns>   yes«»
<PsychoLns>  don't spread the module..  it's a MED module«»
<Ghandy>     ahhokay..«»
<PsychoLns>  sheep dictionary is an intro we made at SM99  .. portraying all the other danish groups as different kinds of sheep«»
<Bifrost>    and it got 1st and 3rd price ;)«»
<Ghandy>     1st AND 3.rd???? he«»
<Ghandy>     how came that?«»
<Bifrost>    we made a sheep reconizer to :)«»
<farfarLns>  well..it's divided into two parts.«»
<Ghandy>     ;-))))))«»
<PsychoLns>  it consists of to intro (they forgot the max 1 intro per coder rule) ... one dictionary and one where you can test yourself«»
<PsychoLns>  two even«»
<farfarLns>  psy: they didn't forget it :)«»
<farfarLns>  although they let it pass :d«»
<Ghandy>     hehe«»
<Bifrost>    ¨because the lack of productions mayhaps? :)«»
<Ghandy>     HOW DID IT COME THAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE SO MANY PRODUCTIONS DURING THE PAST MONTHS?? Cybercinematastic, Impossible, Arla (and I`m sure I forget the half of them)«»
<LaikaLns>   0 +nope you got them all«»
<Bifrost>    first of all I think is because its fun«»
<PsychoLns>  The idea to Cybercinematastic came as early as august 99.. and I guess we was working on it from september/october, so..«»
<gnavbot>    PsychoLns: du er da en sprogspasser!!«»
<LaikaLns>   ohh you forgot rendomithed sheep«»
<PsychoLns>  (hvor skrev jeg bot?)«»
<gnavbot>    PsychoLns: jeg ved ikke hvad du taler om, men jeg vil gerne rode dig i skridtet!«»
<Bifrost>    ad hvor snusket«»
<LaikaLns>   there is a bot among us«»
<PsychoLns>  impossible was only done because we didn't have the time to finish Cybercinematastic actually.. and it didn't took that long«»
<gnavbot>    LaikaLns: du ligger da kraftigt op til en kimono-sugning!«»
<PsychoLns>  and randomized sheep was done in a few days (and it shows :)«»
<Bifrost>    bot or butt :)«»
<gnavbot>    Bifrost: kan du da bare for fanet ikke fatte, at jeg er pisse ligeglad?!«»
<LaikaLns>   I made the sheeps«»
<Ghandy>     When I saw Impossible I really thought .. "THIS CANNOT BE"!«»
<Ghandy>     fuck, is this fast I thought«»
<LaikaLns>   yes it is fast«»
<LaikaLns>   d:)«»
<PsychoLns>  we wasn't sure it was possible (not the speed - we had seen WWROOE :), but the space for texture, 3d in a 40k«»
<LaikaLns>   I made the plane , the flyby«»
<Ghandy>     Jamie, the creator of WeRideOnOurEnemies was also totally amazed. It made him being motivated again..«»
<Ghandy>     motivated to beat you..heh«»e
<PsychoLns>  And we had very little time to do it.. the compoversion (which was bugged as hell - it just didn't show) was just finished 3 hours PAST deadline :)«»
<LaikaLns>   _-_-_-_-_- he can try«»
<Ghandy>     And Modem/Darkage told me:Hey this is like Ride, but only as a 40kb intro!«»
<PsychoLns>  unfortunately it was not as fast as Ride at that time«»
<Ghandy>     Laika, be sure, he WILL! And he`s really a fantastic coder«»
<LaikaLns>   _/-\_come on make my day«»
<Ghandy>     Psycho, you told me you`re planning MANY MORE RELEASES this year like Impossible2 etc.? Tell me more..«»
<PsychoLns>  AFAIR we didn't have a working mapper until 5 days before the party (and remember when the party takes place...)«»
<LaikaLns>   do i have 5 bullets or four in my gun«»
<PsychoLns>  yeah .. because Impossible is so incomplete we decided to make a really finished and polished sequel«»
<PsychoLns>  and for the same reason it does not matter that much when it is released, as long as it is perfectly done :)«»
<Ghandy>     That sentence could have been out of Jamie`s mouth..«»
<LaikaLns>   the truth is out there«»
<PsychoLns>  yeah.. it sure could! :)«»
<Ghandy>     Do you want to tell me something about your co-op Demo with Ephidrena?«»

<Ghandy>     don`t worry, if you don`t want to speak about that, we can quit that tipic«»
<Ghandy>     topic«»
<PsychoLns>  I don't know how much we are going to say about it yet... especially as it is a coop«»
<farfarLns>  nah, np.«»
«c6»Notify Detected nick blueberry (+tzgr@p3E9E785C.dip0.t-ipconnect.de).«»
«c5»<Ghandy>     yes, psycho mentioned it in a chat 2 days ago..«»
<PsychoLns>  not only with eph.. some well known external musician will do the music, so...«»
<PsychoLns>  musicians even«»
<Ghandy>     Okay, np. Then let us speak about ARLA. I`m sure it was surprising for everyone to see a new demo from LNS after only such a short time after Cybercinematastic.«»
<farfarLns>  hehe..«»
<Ghandy>     HOW did you do that?«»
<LaikaLns>   Yes I made the tunnel and the man«»
«c6»Notify Nick _pyg_ is gone.«»
*    Ghandy found a link to SCENET in the Loonies homepage.. yoooohhh! rocks!«»
«c5»<LaikaLns>   annd I animated them as well«»
<PsychoLns>  well... it's a quite unsual loonies demo ... it's just effects that is not really made for the demo ... but almost all routines are made since Cybercinematastic«»
<PsychoLns>  but we wanted to do a PolkaBrothers style demo«»
<Ghandy>     How came it to make another demo after such a short while??«»
<farfarLns>  we try to make a demo / an intro for every party we attend..«»
<farfarLns>  we try to make a winner-demo / intro for every... :)«»
<PsychoLns>  hehe«»
<Ghandy>     farfar:heueheuhe«»
<PsychoLns>  another reason is that we got a lot of critisism about Cybercinematastic being "3D-only" so we wanted to do something else  (which is 3d too, but people don't consider that kind of routines "3D":)«»
<PsychoLns>  to show something else even«»
<Ghandy>     The picture at the end remided me of older Melon Design demos. (that melk)«»
<farfarLns>  ..and a lot of criticism about impossible being only 3d as well..«»
<PsychoLns>  farfarLns: no, "we make a winnerdemo/intro for every party we attend" :)«»
<farfarLns>  yeah yeah...but people don't always realize that! :)«»
<Ghandy>     hehe«»
<PsychoLns>  ahh yeah.. the name... it's almost a Gevalia/PB clone anno , and like gevalia is a coffee brand, Arla is a milk brand ;)«»
<LaikaLns>   did I mentioned that i train Judo as well, i kinde.. forgot to tell you.«»
<Ghandy>     WHAT ABOUT THAT "LOONIES RECORDS" THING? NEVER HEARD BEFORE...«»
<LaikaLns>   ask tarmslyng«»
<LaikaLns>   he is the founder of the lable«»
<Ghandy>     well, he isn`t here unfortunatly«»
<LaikaLns>   sorry :(«»
<PsychoLns>  it's tarmslyngs private label for minimalistic techno«»
<farfarLns>  guess it's just tarmslyng's project.«»
<Ghandy>     Psycho:WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW - HOW CAME IT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT EFREET TO JOIN LOONIES?«»
<Ghandy>     you and blueberry«»
<PsychoLns>  I have never been in efreet«»
<Ghandy>     uhh.. am I`m crazy?«»
<PsychoLns>  and blueberry is still in efreet too«»
<PsychoLns>  (and efreet IS kinda active actually)«»
<Ghandy>     Didn`t you do deep pan? or was that only Blueberry?«»
<PsychoLns>  Blueberry and lemmus«»
<LaikaLns>   he is only a parttime looney«»
<PsychoLns>  afair blueberry joined because Efreet is dedicated intro only group«»
<Ghandy>     WHAT ABOUT THE DANISH SCENE THEN? IT REALLY SEEMS TO BE ACTIVE UNTIL TODAY. (COMPARED TO THE GERMAN ONE WHICH SUCKS)«»
<farfarLns>  yeah. he wanted to do demos.«»
<LaikaLns>   ½«»
<Ghandy>     ?«»
