«c2»There is man. And there his possibili-
ty to decide. Once he was  a  cell  of
millions. But he stood up and made his
way  through   the   years   and   the
problems, always on the egde to nonen-
tity.  And  he  became a great warrior
and superior to  nearly  all  kind  of
lifeforms he met on his way to  divine
kindness.  But suddenly he failed. Due
any unknown reason he  stood  in  deep
darkness    not   knowing   what   has
happened. He seems to loose his faith.
And again he has to decide.  What will
be  his  choice  this  time?  Will  he
struggle?  Or  will  he  be strong and
survive? One more time...«»

Once I had a dream.  A dream of an own
mag.  Nearly the dream Zerox had since
years. Not only since one and  a  half
as me. I had to decided between trying
to  make  my  own  dream come true and
doing my part to make  a  scene`s  one
becoming   reality.  And  this  choice
wasn`t that hard to be made.  For  the
ones  among  you  who  doesn`t know, I
tried to release "Off World" since the
beginning  of  1999  when  Phoenix  #3
failed and the diskmag scene seemed to
die more and more. And I really tried!
With two groups and three coders,  but
the engine is still not ready today. I
already  got  the fourth title picture
but my articles became  outdated  once
again. By talking to Papa Ghandy I got
to know that the rebirth  of  D.I.S.C.
will  be  true  and  not another rumor
only. So I directly wrote an e-mail to
Zerox and before I could  take  breath
again I got my own column.«»

But why this damned depressive name???
It will not take very long to explain:
I  simply  felt  this  way  the   last
months.  And  Zerox liked my intuitive
selection for the  name.  Just take it
as  my comeback from a bad but luckily
short (1 year only) trip to real life.«»

And what do you have to expect to read
here? Well, I am a  swapper  and  made
also some rather bad ascii-collections
but mainly I am a writer, in real life
too. Articles,  shortstories,  screen-
plays (also for a lot of  demos  which
didn`t come true) and even  poems  are
my kind of art.
At  last  I am a pessimist and now you
can surely imagine what  you  will  be
forced  to  read  in this small and in
any   case   very   personal    column
exclusively written for  D.I.S.C.  But
maybe  you  are  wrong  and   I   will
surprise you with something different.
Optimistic  and  not  scene related. I
can  not give you the answer, you have
to taste it by yourself. So do it.«»
