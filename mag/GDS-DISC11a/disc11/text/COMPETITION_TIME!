«c1»In every issue of D.I.S.C. we're going to give away a nice prize in our
easy competition. In the future this competition will probably be under
a new corner planned to be called Zero Gravity. Usually only few sceners
bother to take part in any kind of competition, and therefore there's a
BIG chance for you to be the lucky winner. I recommend everybody to take
part and have some FUN. I especially call upon all editors world wide to
show the way... The winner will be announced in the next issue of
D.I.S.C. and get the prize by mail.«»

Now... what can you win? This time I want to give away a CD-ROM packed with
various contents. The CD includes Design Work 2.0, Worms -
The Director's Cut, World Wide Web, AmiFTP, HotListHandler, AnimGif, PC-
emulator, PHX434, AmiCDFS, a lot of gfx, animations, music, demos, games
and more. So no need for you to stay away from this cool compo. According
to my knowledge this is the only competition with a decent prize too. Here are
the few simple questions you have to answer:«»
