«c5»The famous norwegian megaswapper «c2»Punisher «c5»has had a rough time the
latest year. It all started around a year ago when he was a victim of
«c2»unprovoked violence.«»
«»
«c6»THE LOVE-QUARREL!«»
«»
«c5»One ordinary evening when Punisher was out with a few friends at a nightclub to
have a few beers, something which would «c2»change his life «c5»happened. He was
sitting on a chair in a nightclub enjoying a beer when suddenly two local
«c2»hooligans attacked him «c5»from behind. Especially one of the attackers was
very active. As Punisher was «c2»knocked down «c5»on the floor this local loco
continued to «c2»beat and kick «c5»him when laying down. And his helper couldn't be
worse, so he added a few kicks too. So together they «c2»maltreated «c5»young
Punisher. Punisher was more or less «c2»beaten senseless «c5»when a few friends
managed to get the aggressors out of the nightclub.«»
«»
The bloody megaswapper ended up in «c2»hospital «c5»with an open skull. Luckily he
didn't get any longterm damages. But the «c2»psychic suffering «c5»didn't end.
The hooligans came to his school and threathened him not to notify the
police. He also got phonecalls from people he didn't even know which came with
«c2»deathtreaths.
«c5»However, Punisher was brave and didn't let the hooligans and their
friends influence his decision.«»
«»
The background for the assault was that the main attacker had a «c2»crush «c5»on
a girl also Punisher liked at that time. The local hooligan was so
primitive that instead of trying to get the girl, he attacked Punisher.«»
«»
«c6»THE TRIAL«»
«»
«c5»As the legal system in Norway is far from perfect, it takes quite a long
time from a «c2»crime «c5»has been commited, the investigation get finished
to the criminals are put in front of a court. This happened also in the
case of Punisher. However, last year the hooligan was sentenced
to 15 days in «c2»prison «c5»and 30 hours of community service. It's not a hard
«c2»punishment, «c5»but at least it was Punisher which punished at the end...«»

«c6»THE FUTURE«»
«»
«c5»Nevertheless, it was not so funny going out in the city where he used to
live after that incident, so Punisher «c2»flee «c5»to a bigger city in the western parts
of Norway. And he'll stay there until things calm down a bit. Now he's
currently studying and of course «c2»swapping «c5»as usual.«»
