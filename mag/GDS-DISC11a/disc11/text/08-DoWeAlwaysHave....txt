«c2»as they say here in France.  It means:
My beloved Amiga, and that is what you
are. Well, this is the  third  try  to
write you something about this breath-
taking  city and I guess I will finish
it  this  time.  On the way to Paris I
could not sleep at all and it was  not
because  of  the noises the train made
or  the  small  beds  we  had.  It was
because I already missed you so much.
The  whole  night  I stared out of the
window trying to fix some point at the
flying  landscape  always  thinking of
your LEDs. I am sure about you missing
me the same way.  But  you  don`t have
to.  I  will  be back earlier than you
can assemble.
Thereby  you feel not so alone anymore
I will write down a  poem  I  composed
for you last night.It isn`t that good,
but  you will know how I feel when you
read it.«»

«c2»I  hope  you  like  it,   but  let  me
continue writing about the  the  first
part of our journey...«»
When   arriving   at   the    Northern
Trainstation, most of  us  where  more
than  tired.  Some  of them took their
girl friends on the long way in towers
and this made me feel more bad leaving
you home alone. I hope  you  are  okay
and  that  the  weather  in  Leipzig -
which   the  well-known  poet   Johann
Wolfgang   Goethe  called  his  little
Paris by the way - is as good as it is
here.  No clouds,  only sunshine makes
me feel pretty good.  The tourists are
everywhere  but  I already feel like a
habitant  again  after  visiting  this
town  the  6th  time  and I am smiling
about their behavior too.  Here live a
lot of people you can meet.  Some very
interesting  ones  at the one hand and
some very beautiful at the other.  Not
that you misunderstand:«»
You  don`t  have  to be jealously! You
are my only love! I swear!!! And it is
really hard to be  here  without  you,
but  I  am enjoying everything as much
as  possible  until  I  will come back
home  to  you,  my  dear.  It  is  the
typical french way of easy living that
takes me on a ride. I simply spend too
many  great  days and nights to become
sad. The city doesn`t give the time to
breath even to cry.«»
You would like this way of living here
with the traffic and the  lights.  You
would  love the modern industry circle
around the middle, the old part of the
town, with all  those  high  buildings
and  factories,  that  look a bit like
mainboards at all.«»
Next time you should come with me. And
when you will be here with me, we will
spend  the nights in some gloomy hotel
room and we will laugh about today and
will not have to  ask  ourself  if  we
always have Paris,  because we already
have it today. Forever.«»
«»
Okay,  I  will  try  to  get  !nternet
access  somewhere  to  send  you  some
e-mail.  Sleep  well  and   hold   the
monitor high, sweety.«»
«»
Salut, mon amour.«»
