«c5»Editors is a new creation in D.I.S.C. Previously we have included all kind
of scene-releated articles, including the articles about editors, reply
articles etc. in the Scene section. However, this new section is ment to
be a playground for editors. We have not included too many of such articles
in this issue of D.I.S.C. as we wanted to focus more on the demo scene.
However, in the future we are sure there will be plenty of articles of
editors writing about editors, editors views, reply-articles, about new projects, mags
etc. Nevertheless, in this issue we have articles from Ghandy, Darkhawk,
Zerox, Coach and Punisher. Enjoy!«»
