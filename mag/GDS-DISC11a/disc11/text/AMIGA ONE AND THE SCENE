«c1»This article is, as opposed to the
others I've written this day, quite
original, heh. Or rather, nobody has
put down their thoughts on this
matter, if they have had any. Simply
put, what is going to happen with the
Amiga demoscene when/if Amiga's plans
for this christmas and beyond come to
completion?«» 
«»
Now, I don't know how much you know
about Amiga's plans, but shortly put,
the «c6»new Amiga «c1»is, as it appears now,
all about the «c6»software, «c1»which is quite
revolutionary, theoretically being 
able to run atop any OS and any
processor, without being slow. This
makes it possible for Windows and
Linux developers, for instance, to run
the OS and write their software for
it, and then it will run on any other
computer that has the Amiga OS
installed. Theoretically this will
mean the next big revolution in
computing, and on top of that, the new
OS is slick, fast, easy, intuitive, in
short, very Amigaish. Right now, 15000
people have bought the developer cd
for Linux, and now version 1.1 of the
cd, is ready for Linux and Windows.
Amiga says the OS will be ready for
the public this christmas or shortly
thereafter. On the hardwareside, they
have made deals with hardware
companies they are going to recommend
for their software, meaning that the
«c6»AmigaOne «c1»(One stands for it being
single processor only) supports e.g.
Matrox drivers, and writes software
for it. Also, Amiga has said that they
will design a motherboard, which they
will let other companies manufactore.
Thus, there will be a unique OS and a
unique motherboard, the rest will be
PC parts and whatever processor you
would like to have. Well, that is the
news as I have understood them thus
far, if that is unaccurate, I am not
to be held responsible, heh..«»

Anyway, with this introduction out of
the way, we can now get to the real
topic, a quite interesting topic which
will have a tremendous effect on the
«c6»future of our scene. «c1»What will become
of the scene when this new computer
revolution occurs (yes, let's pretend
that there will be no problems, and
things work out as I described them
above).«»
«»
What will we do? Will we completely
abandon traditional 68k demomaking,
and will everyone make the switch over
to the VP assembler of the new Amiga
software? Will all articles about
doing OCS/ECS demo's again have been
wasted, because a much greater change
is about to take place, and one can
only look back that far? Or will the
scene be split up, a few groups
initially supporting the new
platform(s), most staying back and
producing traditional stuff for a
while?«» 
«»
The switch from OCS/ECS to AGA was
quick and decisive, after one year,
everybody were doing AGA demos. As 
opposed to that, the switch from 
68k to PPC has been virtually 
non-existant. I think that this time,
the switch will be very quick though,
because ehrr, most of us already have
most of the hardware needed for
running the «c6»new Amiga OS «c1»at home,
eheh. Also, if this happens, it will
be a much, much bigger revolution in
computing than the switch from ECS to
AGA. In addition, the PC scene will
slowly merge into this «c6»new scene «c1»too,
although that will take a bit more
time ofcourse. In the end, there will
be this new scene and the C64 scene.
Maybe some oldskoolers like my group
will try to keep on doing OCS and AGA
stuff, but we will become a minority
fairly quickly I think. So, part
conclusion must be that IF this works
out as Amiga intend, «c6»the scene will
grow bigger «c1»and will move almost
entirely to the new way of doing
productions, productions that work on
all computers, regardless of hardware.
Thus the next question arises.. What
will that do to the scene?«»
«»
We will finally have access to all the
hardware we want, so we can stop
pseudo-competing with the PC scene in
regards to 3D worlds, and maybe do
something «c6»more original «c1»instead. This
is maybe a naive hope, rather we might
loose every last bit of originality
and just focus and bigger and «c6»bigger
3D worlds, «c1»I don't know. However, one
drawback of a production being able to
run on all platforms, will be the
speed of it, there will have to be
some standard where it runs decently,
or which is the minimum requirement.
This standard will likely be what
Amiga themselves say. Also, there will
be decent development tools available
from the start, atleast for the coder, 
as the «c6»VP assembler «c1»is the core of the 
new Amiga OS.«» 
«»
So, it would seem that we will not be
too bad off in the future, but it is
strange that no one has thought about
this, after all, we're just a few
months away from having our well known
scene quite thoroughly changed, if
things go as the guys at Amiga have
planned, so maybe we should think a
little about what we will do, and the
changes that will take place. Or maybe
we should just wait, and check out
what they have come up with, as we did
with the A1200. Still, I hope that
somebody does remember the «c6»old ways of
demomaking «c1»and takes it with them to
the new frontier so to speak. And that
someone stays back too, and makes
oldsk00l 68k demos, preferably
OCS/ECS, hehe.«»
