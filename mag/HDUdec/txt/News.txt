    News about Amiga game-position
===========================================
With the pages being left on the sideburner for the last few 
weeks, the time for a news round-up has never been better. 
Heres the stuff that I have missed and also a bit of new information.

First off Trapped 2, as if none of you know, has been released.  
This excellent looking 3D game has gone down quite well and 
was awarded 92% by the UK magazine CU Amiga.  

For those of you interested in the Diversia Demo, and are 
awaiting it's release.  Well it would seem your going to have to 
wait a little longer, the demo has been released, but to publishers
only.  There will not be a public version released until just before 
the actual games release in December '97/January '98.

Another Command & Conquer clone, Forgotten forever is also 
eagerly awaited. Many have been asking what us going on with 
this game, well heres the story so far.  The pathfinder has now 
been finished (One of the difficult parts of the game).  The
programmers are now working on re-coding the game to C instead of
Assembler, mainly so it is easier to port. The author will not commit 
himself to a release date for the demo or that game, so I guess you'll 
just have to wait....

A few Vulcan games should be coming our way soon.  Uropa 2, 
Wasted Dreams & Final Odyssey are all very nearly ready for release, 
hopefully all three will be released very soon, Uropa2 and Final Odyssey
are set for a November 1st release.

=======================================
Rumours
=======================================
Although there has been a lack of games news recently there are 
still a large number of rumours circulating, here are a few of the more
interesting ones I have heard.

First off, EF2000 has come up again.  I reported quite a while ago 
that there was 'supposedly' a version of this being made for the PPC.  
Well, weather or not this is the same rumour circulating or maybe more
news on it has been released I'm not sure.  I guess it's just one of them 
things when we'll have to wait and see...

I have also heard that there is Tomb Raider type game in development 
for the Amiga.  It is nothing to do with Eidos what so ever but completly
independent.The game will apparantly be 040+ only and features some 
spectacular graphics.

One thing that may please you adventure fans out there is that Monkey 
Island 3 is coming to the Amiga (Apparantly :).  It will be available for 
PPC Amiga only and will be release by none other then LucasArts 
themselves.  You may think it is kinda strage that LucasArts are coming 
back to the Amiga with such a big title, I do too.  However, as long as there
is a chance that it is true, it is excellent news.

What else is there?  Well, I have heard information about a PPC only 
Quake clone that is being coded. Also there have been a lot of rumours
flying about regarding Clickbooms next game, some have been told it is 
a new game, others that it is a port. I personally have a pretty good idea 
what it is but, for now, I will be keeping this too myself...

Vulcan Press Release
============================================
I'm sure many of you already know this but below is a press 
release from Vulcan regarding a big move in there distribution network :

Vulcan Software Limited is proud to announce huge changes to it's 
operations. An exciting new alliance has been formed, from 
October 1997 Weird Science Ltd and their international trading 
partners GTI GmbH will begin exclusive distribution of all Vulcan 
products.

Vulcan has been distributing it's own products for the past four 
years to dealers around the world and to the public through it's 
international mail order service, but all this is about to change. 
GTI will be taking over Vulcan's European trade accounts whilst all 
Vulcan's existing registered users will be transferred into the capable
hands of Weird Science who will provide them with regular mailings 
about Vulcan releases along with excellent mail order service.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our registered 
users for their support and encouragement over the years and offer 
our reassurance that they are not losing a Vulcan but gaining a Weird
Science and it's for the benefit of all concerned including the Amigas future.

These changes have been undertaken as a direct result of the 
enormous expansion of Vulcan's development and publishing 
operations. Vulcan has set it's sights on higher spec titles in it's 
drive to bring Amiga gaming in line with other platforms. In June 
1997 we announced that all future titles would be Amiga CD Rom
only in direct response to the quality of software that is currently in
development and began actively supporting graphics cards and 
sound cards in releases such as Genetic Species, Hard Target 
and Almagica. Future developments include PPC support, details 
of which will be announced shortly.

"We felt that in order to realise our current goals, we would have to
re-evaluate our existing operations." says Lisa, director of Vulcan 
Software. "It is all very well producing the cream of Amiga 
Entertainment software but it is equally important that the distribution
network can do justice to the efforts of our army of developers which
now includes 14 dedicated teams and over 100 graphic artists, 
musicians, programmers, 3D animators and translators. With Weird
Science and GTI handling our distribution needs we can dedicate 
our time and resources to our development and publishing operations."

All these advancements can only build on the excellent record we 
have achieved so far, our list of imminent releases is a testament 
to this and includes the likes of Strangers, The Final Odyssey, 
Uropa2, Genetic Species, Hell Pigs, Wasted Dreams, Hard 
Target and Almagica, Scions of a Forgotten World.

Weird Science and GTI are professional, imaginative companies
with a real commitment to the Amiga Market, together we can 
ensure that all our releases are given the exposure they deserve 
and are accessible to Amiga users everywhere.

Live Long & Prosper!

   CONSTRUCTION - The Hidden Software
============================================
Construction is a new game from a programming team called
'The Hidden'. They have been around on the Amiga scene for 
a very long time developing games such as Donk and were 
working on The Big End and The Hidden Golf to name just two.
Recently, however, they have been very quiet and nothing has
been heard about these or any of there other games. However, 
things have now changed and I have been told that they are still
writing a number of games for the Amiga, of which Construction
is one.

Construction a platform game (something which we don't get
much of these days) with some very colourful and well drawn
graphics. The game contains a very big puzzle element. You 
take the part of two builders (more on this later) called Sharkey
and Snork who have to build urrmm, buildings :). The aim of 
each level is to complete a certain percentage of the building 
without getting killed.

The gameplay is kinda similar to tetris in a way.  Whilst dodging
the nasties on each level you have to finish off the building, for 
each part you do you get cash, however, everytime you get hit by
the nasties you loose some cash, all you have to do it break even
at the end of the level, if you don't then you have to play it again. 
It all sounds kinda complicated but when you understand it, it is a
very nice idea.

Going back to the mention of taking the part of two builders, well,
this is where the fun begins.  The game is designed as a two player
game with each player taking the part of one builder, it takes real 
teamwork to complete each of the levels.  However, one player can
play by thereself as the other player will run using its own unique 
personality controlled by the computer. The game will run on any 
ECS Amiga With at least 1Mb Chip RAM.  This may sound kinda 
low specs by todays standards, but don't let this fool you into thinking
the game is not any good.

=============================================
   Fortress of Fear.
=============================================
Some of you may remember Fortress of Fear from when the game
was announced quite a long time ago. Some may have even thought
the may have been abandoned, well I can assure you that it hasn't.

For those of you that do not know, Fortress of Fear is an RPG game
that is similar in some respects to the excellent Diablo on the PC. 
As well as containing al the RPG elements you would expect there it will
also contain a number of action elements.  Like Diablo the game will be
viewed from an isometric perspective.

The game is reported to be massive, the game will take part in one hugh
world instead of a number of small levels, of course, in this would you will 
be able to explore villages, caverns, dungeons etc. there will be a number
of quests to be solved. The reason for the fact that there has been no news
about the game recently is that the team have taken a small break recently, 
this was for a number of reasons.  This and the fact that they are trying to 
make the game as perfect as possible before they release it has contributed
to the demo & and game being late.

Regarding the spec that will be needed to run the game, well, they are
quite high.  The minimum is an 030/50mhz with 4Mb RAM, a CD-ROM 
and a Hard-drive. Obviously more power would be recommended.  At 
the moment they will be making two Amiga versions, one for AGA and 
another for CyberGFX.  This is alongside the PC version of the game 
they are producing.  In the future there is a chance of a PowerPC version
being developed.

Currently the only release date that has been given is 1998, however, they
are aiming to get a demo finished by the end of 1997, but this is far from certain.

=============================================
  FOUNDATION - THE GAME OF YEAR 1997
=============================================
According to the survey Foundation is currently the most eagerly 
Awaited Amiga game. People have been waiting for the game for 
a very long time now and the release date has constantly been put 
back, however, you will not have to wait much longer. The game 
will almost certainly be ready for December. Below you will find the
latest info on how the game is progressing and some exclusive
screenshots from it.

Over the past few months the author has been able to work on the
finer points of the game and it is now looking very special. One of the
major additions is a new medium-resolution set of graphics (Which
are for 640x256 resolutions). This has been added for those that 
want a something more then the Low-Res version but don't have the
power to run the High-Res. To be able to run it you'll probably be 
needing an 030/50Mhz at least, for those with lesser Amigas the 
Low-Res version will run nicely on a plain A1200 with Fast RAM.  
As for the High-Res version you'll almost certainly need a GFX 
card with an 040 processor (Preferably Zorro III, although Zorro II 
should be Ok), it will be possible to run it on an 060/50Mhz without 
one though but you'll need lots of free memory. Currently, a 800x600
screenmode is playable on a GFX card equiped system.

A word about the levels in the game, currently it is planned to 
have 40 mission levels in the game, these will take place over 
4 different terrain types - Summer, Winter, Gloomy and Lava.  
Each map will be different in size from a rather small 64x64 to a
massive 512x512.  As well as these there will also be a random 
level creater included with the game, this will allow you to create
some great personal levels.  There will also be the option to feed 
Greyscale images and have the system add trees etc to it. I have 
also heard talk of a map editor program that allows you to design 
your own levels, however, this is unlikely to find its way into the 
final release (Final being actual game release, read below
for what may happen after...).

One of the excellent new features that has been added is the 
implementation of air-ballons, these will allow transport of your 
people and also can be used to make air-raids on your enemies
- something that sounds very good.  While on the subject of the 
fighting features the game will now implement an archers hut and
a gun tower to help you protect your land. Place loads of these on
the borders of your land and you'll be sorted.

Presentation is also another part of the game that has been 
worked on a lot recently.  The game now has some stunning looking
menu screens and also has a rendered intro screen for each
level. There will able be a number of animations in the game 
that will all help to make it look the part.  Also the sound part of
the game has been reworked, there is now a system implemented
that will allow up to 500 speech samples to be added to the game.

A part of the game that lots of people are keeping a close eye on
is the multiplayer aspect of the game (Especially those on the 
Internet). Currently the game allows up to 4 players to fight against
eachother, however, I'm told that this can be easily expanded to 8. 
The only thing that is worrying the author is the TCP link, currently
play over the Internet is un-tested and he is not sure how well it will
work. However, he is hopefull that any problems that do arise could 
be sorted out.

Well, thats enough about the game for now.  Just a few last things
To mention.  Anyone that thinks that development on Foundation will
stop as soon as it's released are very wrong.  The author plans to make
numerous free updates on such things as GFX card support, the level
editor, TCP play and more. After which he will be starting development
on his new game, I'm not going to say much about this for now but I can
tell you that it will be a wargame allowing 16 or more players to play at 
once and that it will be developed with TCP play and GFX card support
very much at the top of the list.

  NEWS ABOUT Genetic Species
===========================================
Since Vulcan signed up Genetic Species news on the game 
has been kinda low, however, I can now bring you the latest 
news and some stunning new screenshots on what looks to be 
the best 'Doom clone' on the Amiga.
	In the game you take control of a Bioshifter solving hun-
dreds of puzzles and encountering over 15 different enemies in 
over 40 levels.  Since the last demo was released to the public 
the game has received many new features.  Things that the 
game now boasts include AHI Support giving upto 16 channels, 
stunning effects such as distance shading, shot lightsourcing 
and distoration mapping, a massive selection on both friendly 
and enemy characters which have some excellent AI which in-
cludes the charactors group attacking and fighting even fighting 
eachother.
	The game also now boasts 30 minutes of high quality 
CD music and a massive 200Mb 3D rendered intro animation.  
There is also a very interesting feature that will be included, it is 
called The Probe.  This allows both psyche travel throughout 
the envirnoment and the ability to assume control of another 
entity. Once launched you control the direction of the probe 
while intertia carries it forward, if the probe hits a stunned body 
(there are many ways of stunning an enemy) it will take control 
of it.  You (The bioshifter) will then disconnect from the old 
body and takeover the new one. 
	The engine has also been worked on a lot, it was fast 
before but it is even faster now.  Just an example of the speed - 
On a Cyberstorm 060, Picassio IV with 10MB Fast RAM the 
game manages a stunning 50fps (The most a PAL monitor can
display) on all but the three highest screensizes. On the highest 
screensize (320x240) it still gets a very respectable 31fps.

The game requirements have also changed slightly.  The min-
imun requirment of the game is an AGA or CyberGFX/Picassio 
equiped machine with at least an 020, harddrive, 4x CD-ROM 
drive and 10Mb RAM (8Mb Fast and 2Mb Chip), of course
anything more powerful then this will be used to the full.

I'm sure all of you are wondering when you be able to try out 
Genetic Species in it's current form, well, there will be a demo 
on the Christmas Edition of Amiga Format CD.  There is also a 
chance that it will be on the webpage soon, although this is yet 
to be confirmed.  I'll let you know if it is.  Even this demo is old 
now though as there is a host of new features that have been 
added since it was finished. Currently a December '97 release 
is looking on the cards.
============================================
Final Odyssey & Uropa² Demos available.
On the December issue of Amiga Format CD Edition, demos of 
two of Vulcans forthcoming games make an appearance. One is of 
the all-new Final Odyssey while the other is a demo of the com-
mercial version of Uropa².  I'm sure you have heard much about 
both of these games before now, Uropa² is a a mixture of a 3D 
isometic adventure and a vector based shoot-em-up. My views on 
this game can be found in the review of the original shareware re-
lease that I done. Not a great deal has changed for commercial 
release, the main changes that have been made are the inclusion 
of digital speech throughout, an excellent rendered intro and multi 
language support.

Final Odyssey on the other hand is a game that I haven't seen 
much off, that is, apart from a few select screenshots. It is also a 
game that I have been quite looking forward too, and after playing 
this demo, I don't think I will be dissapointed. For those of you that 
do not know Final Odyssey is an adventure game in which you 
have to solve many puzzles and quests. It take a viewpoint similar 
to that of the Chaos Engine, you have to guide your charactor 
through 5 different worlds containing hundreds of screens of ac-
tion. 

Projected release dates for these two games are as follows:-
Uropa² CD - Thursday 6th November.
Final Odyssey CD - Wednesday 19th November.
