==============================================
Short:    Use MagicWB on a TV *WITHOUT FLICKER*
Author:   nc2@st-andrews.ac.uk (Neil Crawforth)
Requires: 8-colour interlaced Workbench, AGA chipset
==============================================

This is an evaluation version of MagicTV, a program designed to
VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE interlace flicker when using a TV, to allow 
more A1200 users to use MagicWB, NewIcons etc.  It is currently 
limited to running on an 8-colour Workbench screen only.

Background:
Interlace flicker is caused because an interlaced screen is displayed 
in two parts - first the even numbered lines are scanned across the 
TV screen, then the odd numbered lines.  If there is a horizontal line 
on the screen, one pixel high, then it will be displayed in one of the 
two scans but not the other, and so it will flicker.  MagicTV gives every 
pixel in one scan a counterpart in the other, preventing this flicker.  
No resolution is lost, and, unlike less effective flicker fixers, no contrast
is lost.

I developed the system over two years ago, to be able to run a 
16-colour interlaced Workbench with my TV.  I still use that program
today, without problems (other than those mentioned below).  MagicTV
is a new version of that, designed for public release, with the aim of 
giving people with low-end A1200 setups the chance to use MagicWB.

Installation:
*  Select a hires, interlaced, 8-colour screenmode for your Workbench.
*  Take a couple of headache pills, or double-click on the MagicTV icon.
*  Be amazed for a few seconds, or e-mail me if it doesn't work.
*  Drag MagicTV into your WBStartup drawer.

Features:
*  Runs as a Commodity.  
*  Allows the Workbench screen to be closed.
*  Automatically adjusts to palette changes.
*  Written in E!
*  Pretty small.

Problems:
* Changes mouse pointer colours.  Change your pointer to suit them.
* Causes problems with playing animations, and AMOS programs 
   (weird flicker every half second, due to MagicTV LockPubScreen()ing
    the Workbench screen).


E-mail me if MagicTV does not work on your system, or if you wish to 
register as a user (I'll send you a copy of all updates to MagicTV), 
or just to acknowledge the hard work that has gone into MagicTV...
