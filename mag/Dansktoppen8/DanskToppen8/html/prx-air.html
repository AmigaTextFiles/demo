<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Uhm... sorry sir.. do we know you?</font>
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">Hoi, I'm Airwalk the Polkabrother.</font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Hmmm... Polka Brothers I've heard that name before ;) - when did
they start, and what is your history in PB?
</FONT></font>
<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">Uh, I'm so bad at numbers.. Let's see, we must have started 
around 93. Vandrup (former Easley/Parasite) and I formed 
Polkabrothers, and ran it as some kind of joke for a while, still 
being members of our groups at that time, Parasite and Kefrens.
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">We've seen some Polka Brothers around lately (you, Slide, Pixie
(now known as Toft)), all with their amiga's - does that mean we can
expect some kind of eagerly awaited release from PB soon?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">"Soon" is relative. I cannot promise any release at some special 
time at all - but I think IMHO that one day there'll be something 
comming from us again, as we still run Polka as a Hoby. I can say 
that Slide is working, Pixie is working as hell, and I'm coding. But 
it's been like that for quite a while now :)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">What does an oldtime scener work with in real life - in other words
what do you do for a living theese days?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">I study engineering, programming and electronics.
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">When was the last time you got up too late, but just stayed in bed anyway?
:)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">Haha, yesterday :)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Is the Amigascene the same now as it was when Polka Brothers ruled?
And what is the difference?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">"When Polka ruled" - my God, it was never ment to be like that.. I 
see stunning demos from everywhere nowadays, from people I've
not even heard of - maybe because I haven't made much contacts
since that time. One difference seems to be the interest in
hardware rather than software. As Merge once joked, "Who needs
Fastmem - Only people that can't code". Let's go A500 again, see
where C64 went - and they're still working!
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">What do you think is real quality in a demo/intro?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">Music (which a miss these days - BOM BOM BOM BOM ..) and
design. Coding is not even nessasary.
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Did any releases so far match that definition? :) - in other words,
mention some of your favourite Amiga demos/intros and tell us why
they're your favourites.
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">DCS's KLONE makes me come.. (Not that the code is bad :)) This
guy Adam really knows how to find the right colors :)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Oh! I just love that demo aswell!
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Did you know that it's possible to push a cow so that it falls on
the ground while it's asleep?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">Yes, I tried it - and I still have that headache now and then :)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Uh oh.. now here's a hard one! - Will you keep your amiga AND your
amigascene spirit?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">Sure, I have 4 amigas. The spirit changed, but so did the scene..
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Oh yeah.. btw: What is THE Amiga spirit in your eyes?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">Nowadays amigaspirit is far to much interested in HW, rather than
SW. Be creative with what you got!
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">What would you do RIGHT NOW, if you were free to do anything you
wanted?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">Eat lunch, have sex and goto sleep ;)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">This IS a real coder! He does a <i>'goto sleep'</i>. Wonder where that label is... ;)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Which was the best party you ever visited?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">Gathering 93, Gathering 94, Symposium 99.. Galemand meetings :)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Has your time running around like a weirdo ;) in the amigascene
given you any kind of usefull experience, that you'll be able to use
in 'real life'?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">Sure, I'm using that every day. Learning computer technics through
programming demos is ALOT more fun than through stupid school
"Hello World" projects!
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Damn.. I've worn this shirt for over a week now.. can't I borrow
one of yours? ;)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">I'm wearing a grey shirt right now, and it's a little too small for me,
maybe it fits you then - how tall are you anyway?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">What's the specifications of your amiga system at the moment?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">A1200 + 060 and 16 extra storage addresses + (soon to come, 
hmm) home made input controller.
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Are you satisfied with it's performance? Why/why not?
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">Yes, sure. Anyway I'm not particular interested in peoples HW
configs - it's a sucking expencive hobby - start programming!
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">What's your favourite style of Music, and what do you booze along
with it? :)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">I love Bob Dylans one man shows, and Niels Hausgaard (yes, it's
true). When I booze I use to listen to my own or Slide's Guitar
playing :)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Is the danish Amigascene too drunk? :)
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#0071FF">[Air]:
<FONT COLOR="#B5BEFF">yes
<BR><BR>
</FONT></font>

<FONT COLOR="#FFB600">[pRx]:
<FONT COLOR="#FFFF76">Aren't theese questions really annoying? :)
<BR><BR>
