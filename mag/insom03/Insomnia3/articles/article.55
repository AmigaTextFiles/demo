XPOLL RESULTSX1) The platforms they use...Amiga only musician        : 35,7%PC only musician           :  7,1%C64 only musician          :    0%Amiga and C64 musician     : 21,4%Amiga and PC musician      : 21,4%Amiga, C64 and PC musician : 14,3%At least refeering to the poll results, the majority of the people answering
the questions were Amiga musicians. Unfortunately I did not find one C64
musician at all... 2) For how long has the average musician been making music on his system...Less then 1 year           :    0%1 year - 2 years           :    0%3 years - 4 years          :  7,1%5 years - 6 years          : 35,7%7 years - 8 years          : 21,4%More than 8 years          : 35,7%Well, many of the musicians make music for QUITE some time, amongst them
Lloyd Rosen, Bay Tremore, Jazz, Pink and WOTW.3) Do they use equipment to produce the tunes ?Does own synthesizer etc.  : 57,1%Uses software only         : 42,8%"Equipment" here does also mean a pure sampler, anything except software
programs to create those modules we all love. A hard thing was how to
judge WOTW's answer here, as he does not use synthesizers for his Amiga
tunes, but nevertheless owns an entire synth park in his private studio.
However, overall one can say that it seems that the generation of sample
rippers more and more disappears and that more and more musicians try
to get their hands on more professional equipment than just pure 
software in order to get their tunes even more catchy... 4) Do they think that ProTracker is still useful?Yes                       : 60,0%No                        : 33,3%Do not know               : 6,6%Still most musicians think that Protracker is still very useful. Let us catch
some reactions here to get to know why Protracker IS useful or why it is 
NOT...MeloManiac: "No and it never has been."Jazz      : "Oh yes it is! It´s one my most beloved musicprograms on Amiga
ever. It has some kind of feeling, which really isn´t achieved
with any other program. I still enjoy composing in Protracker a
lot more than many other programs, although it is only 4ch based.
You still need SKILL to get something cool out of Protracker with
only 4ch. THX is some really nice clubby 64 alike which really
rules, too. So these two programs are the ones and nothing else
on the Amiga"Pink      : "Yep. It's easy to use and efficent."Hardfire  : "I think protracker is a bit useless now, because of all
the good trackers available on PC these days.
If you want still to use an Amiga, DigiBooster is far better
than the good old Protracker."5) Do they have a musical education?Yes                       : 13,3%No                        : 86,6%The average computer musician don't seem to be in need of a special
musical education, though we spotted Juice and Psycho, two musicians
who actually had an education...6) What do they think about the momentary Amiga demo music scene?Dr. Avalanche: "It's quite big, but more and more users are leaving Protracker
in advantage of other tools whose format can't be handled by
every music-player"Bay Tremore:  "Muffler is definitely dominating the Amiga demo music scene.
Where the hell are all the other talented ones? I'd like to
see a GOOD demo with "Mortimer Twang" soundtrack someday."Ganja:        "It has kind of stopped from moving in a better direction. The
last two years had LOTS of great demo music coming out, but
this year been a bit boring. Maybe it's because many good
musicians have left the scene. I personally like Revisq's
demo music best as it's perfect for any demo!"Hardfire:     "Too much techno I think! Really too much... But these days,
I'm much more on the MULTICHANNEL scene... And a lot of
interesting tracks are released, and often by some guys who
have been tracking for years now... So the tracking scene is
still really interesting, with some talented guys like Wave,
Hunz, Mystical, Laxity, Drax, Radix, Scorpik..."Jazz:         "At the moment, there are not many really GOOD musicians left in
the Amiga scene. To be honest, in my opinion there are only a
few musicians left, who still compose great tunes. The scene is
not dying, but due to a lack of newcomers it is about to just
stay, no fluctuation, no movement."Juice:        "I think everybody is frustrated, because it's about time to
move to multichannel, but the Amiga has all sorts of problems
(expensive zorro slots and soundcards, and wack and/or
expensive software)...  So people are getting frustrated and
move to PC where they can make high quality xm's for less
money."Lloyd Rosen:  "Technocrap."MeloManiac:   "It's OK considering the platform situation. But I think demos 
in general lack originality. There has been some recent goodies 
though, e.g. the demos from Powerline and Nerve Axis which I
think have been the most original lately."Notman:       "Nice new music styles popping up everywhere. People are really 
creative and innovative. On many points much more innvative
than the "usual" music scene."Pink:         "Very poor"Psycho:       "It has become bigger. But not better. And almost everyone uses 
Mod2Smp and the mods thereby get alot bigger in size. Though
I think the quality might have enhanced some."Reflect:      "It`s OK! But some demos start to get the same style, due to
much  demo music from the "most used" musicians. Other
musicians should get the chance too! Todays demo music is
303 sample demos.."Wotw:         "Can't say much about it, because I had a break for 5 years!"7) Do they like 303 stylish samples (Created with the popular PC program Rebirth or it's sequel)?Yes                       : 46,6%No                        : 26,6%Depends...                : 26,6%Well.. There have lately been many discussions concerning the rebirth samples
which can be heard everywhere in our soundlandscapes... At least when it comes
to the demoscene... I wondered what the musicians themselves think about the
use of that style. In fact, most musicians liked the style, but I have to add
that some of the ones we asked produce tunes of that style themselves...
Anyway, some can absolutely in NO way cope with those tunes and then we have
some who aren't quite sure and where it depends on the quality of the tune
and on the musical style the samples are used...8) Do they like chiptunes? Do they think they are still popular?Apollon:         "I honestly don't know."Dr. Avalanche:   "Chiptunes are only good for short intros or fun-competitions, 
but in general I don't like 'em, if it isn't a Bubble Bobble 
remake ..."Bay Tremore:     "I think that they're not. (Atleast i don't like them
anymore). They just sound too old... We have to progress in
the music scene too."Ganja:           "They would be, but they don't fit the modern intros too well
... A shame really."Guffaw:          "Ofcourse they're popular... Chippies will always be around
to remind people of their roots in C64 music. I think that 
chiptunes often describe feelings and emotions a lot better
than normal modules with samples... Ofcourse you need a
good stereo equipment and not some lame-ass pc speakers!"Hardfire:        "I still love chiptunes; So to me they are still popular
ofcourse. I keep composing them too... Sometimes on 4
channels sometimes using even 10 or more..."Jazz:            "Naturally there are not many reasons left to still compose
them, but as long as intros exist, there will be chiptunes. 
(And they are melodic & fun,too)"Juice:           "They are. A bad composer can grab loops from a sample CD,
cut and paste them together and make a decent sounding tune.
That way you really don't know these days who knows his
music, and who is just a cut'n'paste artist, because
everyone uses loops. On the other hand, when somebody can
do a good chiptune, then you KNOW he is a good artist as you
need to know about harmony, modes and scales to make a good
chiptune - There's no hiding behind fancy samples - there's
only the music."Lloyd Rosen:     "I love chiptunes! And I'll continue doing them!"MeloManiac:      "Chiptunes popular? YES... Because of the C64 and because of
the restrictions associated with the concept I think."Notman:          "They are usable for intros. Intros are still popular, I think. So it has to be a "yes"."Pink:            "Unpopular. Mostly only c64 guys can appreciate chipsounds."Psycho:          "Real chiptunes are cool as far as they are made seriously
and are kind of happy/funny. Tho I don't think the people
out there who are trying to make chipmusic for their groups
intro's and don't even know some of the most useful
commands in PT for making music. They should not be making
it. Ask me instead...Reflect:         "It`s OK.. Even though I still can`t do any cool ones.."WOTW:            "As we all know the scene started with Sid and chiptunes so
it's great to hear them still today!"9) Why are there so few musicdisks coming out lately ? Apollon:       "Not enough coders and graphicians"Dr. Avalanche: "The demo scene in general is getting smaller... Remembering
those days back in 1993 I received lots of stuff nearly every
day, by snail-mail, but what's up today? Too few productions
in general, and if there is one, it's not made for fun, but
for money in hope to win anything at a competition. The same
goes with the musicdisks... I could write a whole article
about this subject"Bay Tremore:   "No idea"Ganja:         "Because there are fewer musicians who ever compose enough to
make a quality musicdisk and even less pixelers and coders to
actually produce one. I'd love to see a few cool musicdisks
around and thus am producing one myself soon-ish."Guffaw:        "I guess it's due to the fact that most of the groups we know
have become too lazy. The coders are often involved in pc
programming as a living, and don't care much about todays
scene."Hardfire:      "Difficult question... sure there are really few musicdisks
released, but I can't find any good reason for it... For
sure a lack of motivation."Jazz:          "Yep! Competition is almost gone. Nowadays musicians don´t
need to fight for reputation anymore. Those who are still in
the Amiga scene composed tunes for years, and those who are
not - are doing musicdisks. Ok, there are some coming up
still, but mostly it´s old material that is transformed to
disk."Juice:         "I think it's because of the advend of music-mod groups... You
know, releasing mods on their own just like it is. There's
much more mod artists than coders, and this way they can
release their work without looking for coders to do a
musicdisk. Besides, the PC and Amiga mod scene are so
interlinked, meaning that if you do an Amiga musicdisk you
loose half of your audience because they can't run it (And
vice versa)."Lloyd Rosen:   "Musicdisks are not a good release for a party. Everything
released nowadays are for parties. (BOOORING)"MeloManiac:    "One main reason: Noone to code them. I know this problem
from several people I know - they would like to do it but
can't find a coder.  Another problem is motivation for
using maybe 6-12 months on a production so few will see -
demos have a broader 'market' - everybody watches demos, but
not everyone cares about sitting through 30 minutes or more
of music without any fancy effects."Notman:        "Who would release a musicdisk where only one module would fit 
onto a disk anyway?"Pink:          "Why are there so few musicians left?! Any idea?"Psycho:        "Beacuse of the large unstandard. I for one have only a "Clean
A1200 with a HD... No axxelerator card. Today a musicdisk
almost takes up more mem than I even have if I never started
the Amiga. Ofcource there are some chip packs around that
makes the musicpack scene go on. But the larger music disks
are not to common. And that's too bad as they were the only
way for some musicians to get known of the crowd. Especialy
for the ones that never get any demos released as their
music migth not fit the demo right or be in the correct time
aspects right now."Reflect:       "There are much demo releases. Mabye people don't have the
time to do a music collection so often anymore..."WOTW:          "I think most of the coders and graphicians do more stuff for 
companies so there is not the time to code any musicdisks.
Also there are only a few musicians who are able to create a
perfect musicdisk!"10) Was the Amiga music scene better some years ago?Apollon:      "No! Making music sound modern demands a big amount of work."Dr. Avalanche: "OFCOURSE!"Bay Tremore  : "Well.. I liked the old tunes back then, but I don't like them
anymore (Except some Yolk+Legend and Groo tunes). Like I said,
we must progress in the music scene - Maybe we should
experiment more with sounds, not just make music that happens
to be popular at the moment."Ganja:        "Well, not really. As the productions develop so does music.
Every style has it's own time. But like I said, 1996 and 1997
were the best years so far.."Guffaw:       "Better? Older Amiga music was pretty much 'synthpop' with a
poor sense of rhythm, listen to the drums in older mods to see
what I mean. Ofcourse there are always exceptions."Hardfire:     "Oh yes, definitely. The best years were for me 1993-1994, when
Moby, Dizzy, Chromag, Jogeir, Groo were at their top level!"Jazz:         "Yep. And it was a lot better! If I check demotunes these days,
I really have to laugh sometimes, since even some old st-01
instruments have found their way back to some modules, and
there are too many simple techno tunes. Hey boys, electronic
is somehow progressive, but why not combining it with real
instruments? Also a big "sssiiihhh" to the ones who still think
using only distorted elements is then called ambient"Juice:        "Not better. Or worse. Just different."Lloyd Rosen:  "Hehe, it seems as if YOU think so."MeloManiac:   "Definetely yes, without sounding like some oldskool nostalgic 
old fart - I wasn't even on the scene myself in the 'good old 
days'. Demotunes in the late 80's-early 90's were more melodic and 
I tend to like that a lot more than the 99.9% techno-focused
tunes in demos today. I think they all sound pretty similar
and hardly any of the music today stands out."Notman:       "Not at all."Pink:         "Yes"Psycho:       "I think that it's still the same. When I entered the scene in
93, the music were more experimental and not so narrow as it
is today. Musicians like Jogier and Lizardking stod out of
the mass and showed me and the rest the way. Today it's all
"bom bom bom bom" techno and nothing more. Tho there are some
that try to keep the old styles around but they are not the
big mass..."Reflect:      "Well.. Hard to say... Some... Some not."WOTW:         "I think the quality in the past was better because the
scene was bigger. Nearly every musician is producing that
303-shit today which sounds very, very poor!"11) Legendary all time favourite musicians they concern as being really
great, having produced loads of outstanding modules throughout their
scene career.DizzyJesper KydYolkLegendPinkAudiomonsterHeatbeatLizardkingCharles Deenen (Maniacs of Noise)JogeirMantronixSlide4-matRomeo Knight12) Which musicians do they like the most, concerning the MOMENTARY music scene?VirgillKuuMortimer TwangRevisqDavePinkMysticalMufflerDreamfishAzazelPlukselLaxitySlideFinal Question: Should programs like "Mod2Smp" be forbidden in competitions ?Apollon:  "No, because it would be hard to define when samples are mixed "too much"."Dr. Avalanche: "Nope, why?"Bay Tremore  : "No... It's quite useful. And why should it be forbidden? It's a tool to edit sound and a good one it is."Ganja:        "Of course not. Why should be set limits to our imagination? The 4ch is already big enough limit and a challenge and if someoneimplents a great tool like Mod2Smp it definitely shouldn't beforbidden!"Guffaw:       "Hell no... People who like to use it will keep on doing it. And people who think Mod2Smp is lame crap will keep on avoid ingit."Hardfire:     "No, I don't think so... It's a really good tool to improve the depth of your sounds. I've used that in a few tunes, and I don't understand the ones who don't like it."Jazz:         "No, why? We only have 4ch, but if you need to create some better atmosphere and dynamic range, you should use Mod2Smpl. Those people who complain about mod2smpl simply don't know that it's normally used to enlarge channel bandwith instead of only enlarging the size of the module. It shouldn't be overused, tho, since it brings no talent."Juice:        "No. But perhaps they should introduce 40k (Or 10 or 100 or whatever) mod compos (Like they have 40k intro compos)."Lloyd Rosen:  "There could be a size limit on the module perhaps."MeloManiac:   "Nope."Notman:       "Not at all. Should we also forbid people to make melody-lineson their synths and sample it later? I don't think so!"Pink:         "Who needs them? If someone doesn't have any equipment it could be of use.."Psycho:       "It would be great but then it should be two compos. Sadly.... As to many today are hooked in the Mod2Smp way of tracking and would not get to pleased if they sudenly realizes that they have violated one of the main rules in the compo. But ofcourse, more music compos with different rules would be nice for example The Party as there are so very many contributions there. Two compos are too little today... And to play 20 out of 400 tunes are not to really compete. Some how I think good ones still won't be played."Reflect:      "NOT AT ALL? WHY THE HECK? This is a fine way to get more out of 4 channels and 31 samples!"Wotw:         "Yes!"Xby Dascon (c) Insomnia'98 
