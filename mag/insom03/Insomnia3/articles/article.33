Pescara  is situated towards the central part of the Adriatic coast in Italy.
It's easily reachable from all Italian principal cities like Rome and Milan.

>From the Central Station of Pescara take bus number 1, and ask the driver to
leave  you  in front of "Teatro D'Annunzio".  You will see a sort of very big
tower...  well, welcome to the party place :)                                
                                                                             
The  party  officially  starts  on Friday 11th at 12:00 (opening ceremony and
compos start at 21:00), and will have an official ending with prize-giving on
Sunday  13th  at 19:00, but we will only close all doors on Monday morning at
around  10:00-12:00,  so you can even take into consideration to sleep at the
party  place  itself  during Sunday night (and enjoy the last party rave :D).
We  are  taking  great care to avoid problems with our local council, like it
unfortunately happened last year.  So don't worry, just come :)              
                                                                             
There  is  a  free  camping site next to the party place for all the guys who
prefer  pure  air.  A beach is to be found in front of the party place, ready
for  your  favourites wild compos.  Tables and sockets for all (but a mail to
the  organisers  will  be  much appreciated). Party Net with 2 ISDN 64k lines
