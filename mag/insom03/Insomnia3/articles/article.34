Christmas  time;  a  widely recognized holiday season dedicated to traditions
and time spent with the family.  The demo scene also has it's traditions, and
christmas time is particular holy:  Going to The Party.                      
                                                                             
For  the  8th  time  in  a  row, we're proud to hold our annual party in late
December  and  feature  more  competitions,  prizes,  events,  surprises, and
activities  than  ever.  Experience the real party feeling, meet friends, and
see  the  master  work of soon-to-be computer and digital arts professionals.
Or  stare  at  your  monitor for 70 hours straight, live on Coke and peanuts,
feel  the true stress of meeting deadlines, and watch Amiga demos at 04:30 in
the morning without knowing why.  In any case, you'll have to ask yourself:
