2                      by Zulkir Maligor of The Magic Guild


Deep and sad was the silence in the rooms of the Crystal Cave.

Many  shapes  stood  silently  in the cold, dark air, breathing slowly as not to
disturb some sleeping spirit of the Overnatural Reigns.
The members of the Magic Guild were all there, King Arthur himself could be seen
in the multitude of those still, lugubrious, depressed faces.
He  seemed even older than he was, if possible, and he was the most grieved soul
of all the ones who had travelled from the farthest lands of the whole M'Yiomosa
world  to  gather there, in the legendary Crystal Cave, to leave the last salute
to  the  mage  that  had  made  of the Magic Guild the most important, known and
envied group of magicians ever.

Merlyn was dead.

Merlyn,  the  oldest and the noblest of the wizards named Merlyn in the Northern
Lands of M'Yiomosa.
The fact that he actually was the only one of the name Merlyn, isn't important.
He  was the Name, the one for whose health every member of the Magic Guild would
have been happy to donate his own life.

There  was Galdalv, with long white hairs, with the silver beard which seemed to
have  lost  its  natural  fierceness,  at his feet his own favourite creature, a
little  strange  thing of unknown origins and sure lack of intelligence.  At his
side  Rincewind  and is own odd suitcase, which didn't find the courage to crawl
around in such a dark and silent atmosphere.
There  was  Elminster playing a slow tender tune with his enchanted flute, as to
give an helping hand to the empty minds.
The  whole  Magic Guild were there, from Axeman of the Elven Isles to Cyclone of
the  Lands  of  Fire  and Sand, from Druid of the Moonmist Mountains, to Fox and
Eagle  of The Enchanted Plaints, from Mad Bit of Colorado to Nuno of the Rolling
Plains  and  even Painkiller of the Never Never Lands and Macros, Bluestorm, The
Joker,  Oz,  Greystar,  Torchfire and all the faithful Merlyn's close friends of
The  Northern  Lands,  Cogline,  Decker,  Raistlin,  Red  Zone, Gloria-Huk, King
Diamond, Simon, Lord Amen, Medwin, Meegosh, Sperminator, Tarl, Spider.

Also  the  beautiful witches couldn't stand the hard and unbearable air, Athena,
Sadira, Morgana, Corinne...  the natural light of their eyes was darkened by the
utter  sorrow,  by the desperation in seeing the dead body of their master, and,
maybe in their dreams, lover.

They  were all weeping for the only member that had managed to make them to feel
united  and close, even if they lived in distant lands, where different cultures
had built different personalities.


They  were all facing almost astonished the body of Merlyn, lying with a sort of
smile on his own bed.  He died without an apparent reason, while he was sleeping
his  body  had had to battle with some mysterious and wicked spirit, whose hands
managed to grasp his vital essences.


All  at  once,  a  strong  terrible  thunder  broke the innatural silence of the
Crystal  Cave,  it  seemed  an  horrible howl, a scream of a mad man, it was the
voice of the Spirits of Evil breaking the cage of magik that the Guild had built
around them in the legendary Battle of the Tempest.
All  the  wizards  immediately  understood  what was happening, in all of them a
sudden  shock  of  horror  crossed the eyes, their minds forgot for a moment the
real reason of their gathering to think about the immediate, fearful future.

A universe of fire and noise invaded the Crystal Cave! They were attacked!

The  Spirits  of Evil had somehow destroyed their magical prison and could cross
again the lands of M'Yiomosa, spreading death and terror, disease and pain!
They  decided  to  start  the  slaughter from the Magic Guild itself, their most
hated  enemy which was now weakened by the departure of Merlyn, the one with the
strongest magical powers.

All  the mages started to battle, they invoked their friend spirits, they casted
the most powerful spells they knew, they were ready to die in this second Battle
of  the  Tempest, they knew that it was their only possibility to save the world
from  chaos.   The Spirits of Evil were the most horrendous menace for the peace
of the world.

The  colors  and the sounds, the smells and the thunders of this huge battle are
signed  forever in my memory, I can see it now as it happened so many years ago,
my  presence  on  the battlefield of the crystal Cave has marked forever my same
mind,  my  thoughts,  I  can hardly explain what immense flood of magical forces
convened  in  the  Crystal  Cave,  raping  these  holy  places,  leaving me as a
speechless observer, feeling the overwhelming powers subduing my body.

I am a mere chronicler of the deeds of the Magic Guild, but I am lucky enough to
have lived one of the most important and terrible moments of its existence.

Outside  the weather got completely insane, thunders and lights were shaking the
trees, the wind was blowing with power on the hard rain; huge, black clouds were
pouring their essence all around the Crystal Cave while the sea was raging as to
destroy the bounds the lands had built around it.

The  first Battle of the Tempest had started in the same terrific way, this time
the  result  could  not be the same, there wasn't a Merlyn to guide the Guild to
the final victory.

I  saw  King  Arthur  giving  orders to the Guilders, with a strong and resolute
voice, I saw Oz battling fiercely with an immense black evil Spirit, helped by a
decisive  fire  ball  of  Nuno,  I  saw  Druid preparing his essences and drugs,
distributing  them  to  his  mates,  I saw the Magic Guild battling as an unique
creature,   with   multiplied   power,  forgetting  little  jealousies  and  old
misunderstandings among members, I saw white light battling with black light, in
a cascade of flashes, in explosions of energy.

Those  old  and  apparently  decayed  bodies  were  cruising the enemies with an
unnable  rage,  with incredible courage, I saw mages like Greystar and Raistlin,
coming from different and distant lands, battling together with double strenght.
Great  and  glorious  acts  I saw, heroic enterprises and most of all, I saw the
love  for  life  battling  at  the  side of our heroes, helping them in the most
difficult situations.

Slowly,  after an impossible time, the dark evil spirits started to be weakened,
their extreme power seemed not enough for the Magic Guild.
The  wizards,  drugged  to  gain  more forces but tired anyway, started to build
again the cage of magik that could imprison the enemies again.

It  had been another terrible effort, they were giving their last drop of mental
blood  for  that.  I saw their faces wincing in amazing strain, I saw their eyes
burning with hate, their hands grasping firmly the reins of justice.  I saw them
pushing  back  the  evil spirits to their dark and evil world inside the rebuilt
magical prison.

The  battle  was  won, the heroes collapsed to the ground totally worn-out, they
fainted, they closed their eyes as to forget the physical pain and they breathed
again.


They were all sleeping or half awaken, when a melodious music filled the Crystal
Cave and a tender soft light smiled on it.
Jogan,  the sagest of the Gurus and external adviser of the Guild, walked inside
the main room of the Cave.
The  warriors  opened their eyes, they stared at him and they listened surprised
his deep, low and firm voice.

" Congratulations, brothers of the Magic Guild, Merlyn and me are very proud of
your  brave  gestures,  we  have  tested you, we had to know if the Guild can be
strong  enough  without  the  guiding  light of Merlyn and you succeeded in your
examination ".

" That's not a good reason to leave you so early, anyway ", interrupted suddenly
another  voice,  which,  with total surprise of the Guilders (and of your humble
chronicler, indeed) belonged to Merlyn.

Noticing  that  none  of  the magicians could find the use of the tongue, Merlyn
continued  "I was not dead, my loved and esteemed brothers, it was just a spell,
me  and  Jogan  were afraid of the situation inside the Guild, we feared that it
was  weakening  in  thinking about some distracions", he glanced for a while the
group  of  the  beautiful  witches,  "but  I  have  to  say that these ...err...
distractions have proved, as all the others, to be worthy members".


Still  observing  that  the  most  intelligent  glance  in  the room belonged to
Gandalv's  original  pet, bearing in mind that after such a battle they actually
could deserve to be forgiven for their momentary dumbness Merlyn winked at Jogan
and  added,  smiling  a  bit  sadically,  "Well, comrades, I think I am going to
sleep, it has been fatiguing to attend such an hard battle!".

While  he  was  merrily stepping away King Arthur asked him with a tired and low
voice,  as  not  to  be  heard by anybody else, "Merlyn, why haven't you told me
anything  about  this...  test?".
He also stared him with a very suspicious and slightly altered face.

"Oh,  sorry Wart (it was the nickname only Merlyn could dare to use referring to
the king), did I really forget to inform you?", smiled innocently Merlyn.
