You, who are you?

You  are a heap of citoplasmatic matter, a weighty bunch of billions of cells, a
complex  mix  of  Carbon,  Hydrogen,  Oxygene,  Nitrogen and some other chemical
elements.

You think to be unique, different, individual and you think to think.

Your  mind,  you  believe,  is  something  all  your,  which decides in complete
autonomy, which is keen and active.

You think to have a personality, an individuality an own position in the world.

You think to see with your eyes, to hear with your ears, to talk with your mouth
and to think with your brain.  As if it you existed since ever.


Try  to  look  back, try to examinate your roots in order to understand what has
became of you.
You  were  a  single cell, your genetic material came from your parents and what
you had to became had to be related to them.
That's true, but that's not all.
What you are, how you are, what you think and how you think is deeply influenced
by all the experiences you have had during your life.
These  conditionments  are  not only the same well-known ones as the family, the
school,  the social condition and so on, they are also all the micro events that
have crossed your life, for just a chance.

Maybe  if  when  you were 5 years old you decided to watch Tv instead of playing
with  a  toy,  you  could  see  something particular on the screen, you could be
touched  by  it,  you  could relate it to some other experiences you had had and
then  you  could  elaborate  a  different opinion about a particular topic which
could  influence  your way of behaving and then change maybe the kind of persons
you wanted to attend.

It's  only an example, once the little ball of our life has started to roll down
a  mountain,  the  impact  with  a  stone  and  the folllowing direction, can be
completely  random  and  can  change  the path of the ball in totally unexpected
ways.
A  speech  with  a  friend of yours could have made you think certain things and
maybe,  for  this  reason  you  have  faced  a  certain  kind  of problem with a
particular  mentality.   Maybe you have decided to do the same kind of school of
this friend and this has definitively changed your way of thinking.
A physician thinks as a physician, a student of literature thinks in a different
way,  his  same  mental  schemes  are  different,  the way he consider things is
different.
The  differences  are  also  between the physician of subatomic particles or the
physician of newtonian physic, they both study the same scientifical subject but
the  differences  of  impostation,  of  the  same  mathematics  involved,  has a
different  weight  on  their logical processes also in situations not related to
Physic.

What  makes the difference between you and the others, is just the fact that the
events  of your life have been unique and impossible to repeat.  They have given
a particular shape to your ideas and your knowledge.

For  this  reason  you may think that after all you are unique, that's true, but
that  doesn't mean much.  If your thoughts are the rielaboration of informations
and  influences  that  have bombed you since your birth, and if your same mental
schemes,  your  same  way  of  thinking and rielaborating, is influenced by this
external   flow  of  conditionments,  can  you  really  think  to  have  a  real
individuality and personality?

You can if you accept that this individuality is just the fact that you have had
a different life, in its microscopic parts, nothing more.
It would be absurd, or just blindly arrogant, to think to have built by yourself
your personality and individuality.


I referred here both to mental processes and personality.  They are not the same
things,  but probably they have the same roots.  A slight genetic overall scheme
which  has been completely morphed by the social influences of the single.
It's  not  the case here to decide if what we are is completely due to genetical
informations or social conditionments.
I  think  that  on  a  genetic  scheme the society (and with this I mean all the
single events of a life and the relative environment) has had the possibility of
giving shape to everything, even changing the basic genetical general lines.

For  example  a  great  musician  like  Mozart  has had "music in his blood", as
somebody use to say?

Well, I can accept that MAYBE he genetically had somehow a mental predisposition
which  could  find  a  good  work place for a discipline like music (with this I
don't  mean  that  his  mind  was made for music, music is a human art form, the
genetical  based  structure  of  the  mind has biological roots) but for sure he
never  could  become  the  Mozart  we  know  if he hadn't a father musician that
thought him how to play piano if the very first years of his life.

If  Mozart  had  been  the  son  of  a fisherman, he would have never existed as
musician.   Not  only  because he wouldn't have had the occasion of just seeing,
but  also  because  he couldn't have the conditionments that could influence his
mind and give to it a great musical sensibility.

Another  example can be a writer, whatever writer, do you really think that it's
written in his genetical pool his ability to handle words of a language that may
have less than a thousand years?

How can genes be influenced by Human Disciplines?

They  just  can  give  a  sort of foundation which can apply to an activity that
works better with certain menthal schemes.


So, what are the conclusions of this speech?
Just  that  I think (but, as you can guess, this is not a real own mine thought)
that  we  are  just  the  result  of our lives, meaning with that the social and
cultural  conditions and all the single events of our life, that, day after day,
have given a particular shape to us.

Here   stays  our  individuality,  to  think  to  be  indipendent  and  directly
responsible of our personality is just an illusion.
