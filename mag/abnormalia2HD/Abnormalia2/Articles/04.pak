Yesterday evening I finally solved it.  It had been forgotten in my mind already
long  time,  beyond  the other thoughts.  Either it came out without no sense or
somebody  helped  it...Or was it just yesterday planted to be in my brains?  The
words, "God's Aquarium", somehow it started to confuse my head...

The room was again humming randomly around the house, though it knew that it had
better  things  to  do...Damned,  again  it  didn't  seem to be responsive to my
orders!   I tried not to pay attention to it, but somehow it made me nervous...I
felt like somebody was watching me from somewhere higher.
No,  it  wasn't my best liquid friend, Koskenkorva...I didn't have even headache
or heart attack.  What?  Did I say heart attack?

Whole  night  I  wrestled  against  these  answers  which  I  have found from my
thoughts.   Some  problems  I tried to solve for hours, but I didn't come in any
conclusion...But  then, just as somebody would have helped me, hit my empty head
with  a  hammer  of information.  It hurt, but it made some things more clear to
me... Maybe  the  big  boss  thought  that  I was already too hopeless sight for
everybody; it was too useless to tease stupid man with this problem.

In  the  middle  of  the  night  it  was ready:  the answer to all secrets which
humankind  have  sought  for millenia.  Why we are here?  What is the meaning of
life?   What  a hell are we doing with a food processor?  After writing down all
these  important  things  I  finally decided to go to sleep...tomorrow everybody
will know what's it all about!!!

In  the  morning  I  woke  up  and at once I wanted to look what I have written.
Somehow  I  didn't remember very much about last evening.  I got up and read the
paper:

 "Waffles, ei, alati, radis, ezme, galleta, ouzo, dina, svamp, auster,
  queijo, uborka, aspansat, rädisa, iz, uva, makkara, donut, ister,
  dindon, yeast, oxtunga, uovo, gaskavuolla, escargot, tortina, ispanak,
  tarandos?"

Hmm,  what's  that?  Again I seemed to fail what I had to do...or maybe there is
some  secret  inside  that  weird text?  Well, I don't care to solve it, I think
it's better to concentrate to Koskenkorva...

However,  I'm  still  not  sure,  is  this  all true, am I just imagination of a
writer, a text on a paper, inside humans' mind...Or are you only my creation, is
this environment just an illusion, what I really see and what I'm imagining?  Is
this all chaos of my thoughts...

Far  away, where a place and a time lose meanings, some guys are talking.  "Hey,
watch  this!", says number one.  "Wow, it's beautiful so green and blue, what is
it?",  asks number two.  "It is my aquarium, there's everything; plants, animals
and those...", tells number one, who seem to be very proud of it..."Hmm, what do
you  do  with  this  aquarium,  are  there  any  use for it?", asks number three
jealously.   Number  one  answers:   "Well, it's nice to watch what those little
guys  are  doing..."  "Who  are they?", asks number two..."They are called human
beings...by  the  way, there is a guy who almost solved the secrets of life, but
he had drunk too much Koskenkorva!"
