Second issue.
Another breath of words that have to fill the empty soul of a floppy disk.
Articles  to  give  a  meaning  to a title, stories to justify the time spent in
writing  and  reading  them,  efforts that have to underline our presence in the
Amiga scene, as if it could decide our same existence there.

I  have read with curiosity and expectation reviews and comments about the first
issue.
It  would  be needless and absurd to say that I don't care of them, I care but I
don't always understand.
It  seems  to  me  that  a  diskmagazine  for the scene is good if it has a nice
design, a good code (whatever this may mean) and well matched colors.
It  almost  seems  that  a diskmagazine without brushes is below average, that a
piece of coding that doesn't include them is bad and easy.

I wonder what the reader and the reviewer of a diskmagazine wants.
Does he wants clip arts everywhere?
Different fonts and a good intro?
Does  he  still  want standard scene articles, like the ones you can read on the
majority of the scene mags?
News  that  are always the same, comments about friendship and swapping, reviews
of demos and interviews to scene guys?

A  diskmagazine  with good design and ten real articles (have we really to count
in  their  number  the advertisments, the credits, the "how to write an article"
texts,  the two pages long meditations about the importance of pack disks in the
scene?) will surely be more succesful than an Abnormalia.
Well,  if this is what the scene wants, if this is what the reader expects, then
we have completely failed.
I  still think that a magazine has to offer something to READ, it doesn't matter
if it looks marvellous.
Once  the code is fuctional, the graphics are not totally horrible and the music
doesn't hurt your ears, what have you got to ask to a diskmag?
What about some articles?


When  we  decided  to  make Abnormalia we choosed to make it in this way for two
reasons.   First  of all because that was the kind of mag we would have liked to
read,  second because we couldn't fight with the big names in the diskmags field
with their same weapons, as many mags try to do.
We  had  to  find  a different solution, we had to find different topics to talk
about:   new  or  not  much explored fields where to pour our desire of fame but
also new things to talk about, right in the way we wanted them to be.

Maybe  the  average  scene reader doesn't appreciate, maybe we have looked for a
kind of reader that doesn't exist and this has influenced our impact around.


Filippetto  of  Freedom Crack has written in his review:  "If you want something
GOOD to read in the screen of your Amiga, then load Abnormalia".
Nice words, but the overall mark on the mag was quite low, due to the code and
the design, considered of low quality.
Now  I  don't  want  to  comment  the  mark  itself, that's not the point, but a
magazine is something to read or to look?
The most important part of it are the articles or the other things?
To  look  a  nice  picture  I  load  a slideshow, to listen a good music I use a
musicdisk,  to  see  some  powerful coding  effects  I  look for a demo, to read
something I am supposed to take in consideration a diskmag.
I'm  not  saying  that the articles of this mag are better than the others, it's
not  up  to  me  to judge, but I strongly would like that our work is judged for
what it is intended to be.

2Judge what you READ of this mag, not the rest.

This  whole  text it's crap, it's crap because it has had to talk directly about
the  magazine  and  its  purposes, nowadays it seems that allegoric, lateral and
maybe ironic speeches are not understood.

If  you  want  to be understood in the best way you must say things directly, if
you  try  to  be  a  bit  elusive or ironical or sarcastic you risk of not being
understood.
I  won't  wonder  if  somebody will get angry for something written in Scenaria,
without understanding that it's just an ironic and self-ironic scene chat.

Well, here is what I really think of this mag, then.
I consider its articles far better than the average articles of the average mags
around,  I think that the code is fuctional and does what it has to do, that the
design is not ugly and the music is something worth to be listened.
If  you  don't  agree,  you  are  not the reader we were aiming to (this doesn't
impies that you have something bad) or we are just blind by our work.
It happens often in the scene , it may happen also to us.


As  for  the  more or less original and abnormal things that this mag can boast,
here  is  a  direct  and  explicit list, I thought that it wasn't necessary, but
maybe I was wrong.
- A totally ironic part about the scene.  Nothing serious and conventional about
  it (SCENARIA).
- A female co-editor, Phoenix, who should be something new for a diskmag (she is
  real,  you can touch her, hear her, read her words, she's not another Patsy in
  the scene).
- No  advertisments  and  a  reduced  number  of  "service"  articles (credits,
  addresses and so on).
- Few 1500 bytes texts just to fill space.
- A section where all the languages are accepted (BABILONIA).
- Serious scientifical articles, maybe too serious to be liked.
- Stories, more or less abnormal.
- No  group under it.  Abnormalia is made by persons, it doens't matter of what
  group.
- The irony and the tragedy of the contemporary life.
- Different kind of sections like BREVIARIA or CONCILIUM.
- THE LAST JUDGEMENT and the SPANDIMERDA AWARDS.
- A living mag which could say something worth to be read in every line.  (or it
  could be terribly boring and patetic, but that's a matter of points of view).
- A  main  editor who after this article feels himself a sort of traitor of the
  Abnormalia spirit, lateral and indirect, ironic and tragic, abnormal, maybe,
  (even if many people nowadays claim themselves to be abnormal, as if it were a
  sign of coolness) and a bit mysterious.

There is nothing similar in these words, flip page soon... 
WHY the hell have you read this rubbish?!

The  aim  of COMMENTARIUM, actually, is not to defend our choices and to explain
the  spirit  of Abnormalia, it should be a sort of round table where people give
their opinions about the short stories published.
It  would  be nice to probe into the various, more or less deep, meanings of the
stories, to discover maybe, what has been ingnored at a first read.
For this time we have just to be enlighted by Ripper's critics on some stories,
he only has understood what Commentarium is about.
