Mark entered home.  It was 4.00 AM and it was raining outside.
He  never  loved  those  soggy  autumn  days, and considering it was Saturday he
decided not to go to bed and to work with his beloved AMIGA.
He  was  a  genius  and  everyone  underlined  this  thing every time he went on
meetings and such other shits like-looking.  He was a GENIUS.  A GENIUS.  And so
after  about  an hour he decided to create a thing nobody else attempted before:
modifying  Directory  Opus  in  order to use it for playing with life instead of
files.
He  immediately turned on his wonderful Amiga 3000 tower with 32M ram and 4Gb of
HD  space and started his work.  Mark worked hardly for 4 Months, day and night,
isolating  himself  from the world and finally in a shining, beautiful March day
his masterpiece was ready!
With a growing emotion he typed the fatal words "SYSTEM:DIRECTORYOPUS.LFP".  And
he was the only one to know that "LFP" stood for "LIFE PLAYER".
His wonderful Western Digital's HD emitted a deaden sound and suddenly....READY!
Mark  asked for a directory of his life and after a few moments all possible sub
directories were shown on his monitor.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING:  now he could delete all bad events in his life.  He was
going to achieve the oldest dream of humanity, an HAPPY life.
With all those thoughts waving in his head Mark started the job.
He  deleted  that bad car accident in 1978, then these ugly boys joking with him
at  the  age  of 6, then that bitch of Pamela who said "you're my only love" and
then fucked with all her friends except Mark.
After  having  a little rest to focus up what should or shouldn't be erased Mark
restarted  his  work.   In a moment came up to his mind the words of a song of a
rock group:  "WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO YA, WHEN A GOT A JOB TO DO, YOU GOTTA DO IT
WELL...AND  PUT  OTHER  FELLA  HELL!",  and so started with a new vigor deleting
files  on  files....his  sister he never loved....his teachers....his friends he
never tolerated....
After 3 days of work he raised his head up and went to the kitchen....EMPTY
Ran into all his life....EMPTY
Took up his car and had a tour in the city....EMPTY
At the end Mark realized he was ALONE.
Frightened  of  the  situation he determined he opened his house door, turned on
the  monster  he  created  and  selected  the  only  directory  survived  to his
destructive  impulse:   "HD1:FILES/LIFE/BIRTH",  then  clicked  once on the file
"MARK", laid in his chair and pressed the delete gadget.
After  few seconds the HD started to work and a message was displayed on the top
part  of  the screen:  "ALL SELECTED FILES DELETED; RECOVERED FILE(S) UPDATED IN
HD1:FILES/LIFE/DEADS.  OK!"
In 10 minutes all people were back at their places and no one knew who Mark was,
except his computer which is still updating Births and deaths.
