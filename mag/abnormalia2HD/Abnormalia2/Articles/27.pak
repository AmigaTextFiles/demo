Even if you take a dictionary and read what's the meaning of Inquisition you can
understand  that  it's  a  negative  word.   It's  defined  an inquire made with
arbitrary  systems  that  injures  the  human rights; a procedure followed by an
ecclesiastical court to repress heresy.

A  lot of things have been written about this but most of them are based only on
popular  credences  and  common  opinions; now I'd like to present an historical
point of view.

The  Inquisition  was  created  in the late Middle Ages to punish heresy and the
other  crimes  against  the  Christian  faith  (false  miracles,  profanation of
Eucharist,  sorcery,  superstition),  its story must be divided in two different
moments:   the  medieval  and  the modern one, i.e.  after the Reformation.  The
real causes of its birth anyway weren't religious but politic and economic.

It  rises in the XII century helped even by the "secular arm".  In the XIII with
Innocenzo  III  and  Domenico  from Guzman it spreads against the neo-Manichees.
Filippo  Augusto  uses  this  occasion  to  conquer the south of France with the
crusade leaded by Simon de Monfort (1209-1218) against the Albigenses.  Federico
II  of  Germany  decreed  that  every  heretic,  recognized by the bishop of his
diocese, were burst alive.

Victims  of  the Inquisition, besides the Catharists, decimated at the beginning
of  the  XIV, were the dissenting Grey Friars, converted Hebrews, Templars (more
for policy than religion).

The  Inquisition  Procedure  established  a  sort  of  "time of grace", when the
heretic,  spontaneously  given  himself  up, had had light punishments (prayers,
charitable actions, pilgrimages).  After this time the court went on, sueing the
suspect  or asking for his arrest; generally two honourable witnesses (never put
face  to  face  with  the accused) were enough for a sentence.  The penitentiary
regime  could  last  quite  a  few  years and the practise of torture, to extort
confessions, was allowed "citra membri diminutionem et mortis periculum" (except
mutilation  and death danger).  It was Innocenzo IV that allowed torture against
the suspect of heresy, and this practise was accepted by all the italian states,
by France and Spain.  Torture was ordered with a sentence:  the accused, brought
in  front  of  the  torture  tools,  if he didn't confess, was tortured into the
presence of a judge, a chancellor and a doctor.

The  most  common  kinds  of torture were the water one, the rope, the fire, the
forced  waking  and  the fast, but I don't want to delay upon the particulars of
this practise or its brutalities because I think every one already knows them.
It's  interesting  to  notice  that torture disappeared from the interrogatories
only in the XIX century.

The  sentence  was read in a public "general sermon" and could be an absolution,
preceded  by abjuration, the partial or permanent detention and the death to the
stake,  the  execution  of  this  was  granted  to  the secular arm and could be
inflicted even post mortem (after death).

There  were  a lot of famous men that were accused and condemned by Inquisition,
one   of  this  was  Giordano  Bruno,  anticlerical  and  antiaristotelian.   He
considered  religions  like  allegoric translations of a rational Truth in a way
suitable  to  be understood by the rough populations that must be ruled.  He was
pursued  by Inquisition for all his life, so he had been in Rome, Geneva, Paris,
London,  Frankfurt  and Venice, where he was imprisoned.  Roman inquisitors kept
him in prison for seven years without succeeding in making him abjured.
Condemned as impenitent heretic, he was burst alive.

In  Spain  Isabella of Castile obtained the permit for a special court to punish
those descendants of hebrews and moors that continued to practise their religion
secretly.   So  the  spanish  Inquisition  became a court for the defence of the
State and decided even upon crimes that little or nothing regarded religion, for
example  the smuggling.  According to some lay historians, Inquisition condemned
31912 persons to be burst alive and 291450 to the prison.

A  new  chapter  of Inquisition began in Rome with Clemente VII and Paolo III in
the XVI century.  In a first moment it limited itself to persecute the heretical
books  publishing  an  "Index";  after  the competencies increased.  Violent and
cruel  repressions  had  caused  the  persecution  of some catholic prelates and
famous intellectuals.

At  the beginning of 1900 the word Inquisition disappeared, but the congregation
of  the  Holy Office and the Index of the forbidden books remained and are still
in force.
