Long shadows on pale hands.
They melt down on the keyboard, leaving vital traces on the beige plastic.
The keys are bumped, touched, caressed, hammered.
Rage and terror, fear and pain, love and life, sweet and sour stream which flows
through them and comes to the monitor.
New  lands  of  verbal atoms, new worlds of mental components can reach now your
eyes.
From  the  keyboard  to  the monitor, from the monitor to the magnetic soul of a
floppy disk and then back to the monitor you are staring right now.
Words are flowing, just let them come into you.
They can be superficial and flat, they can be boring and uninteresting, they can
be bad and crap, but they something you have not seen before.
Something new, a new sequence of words of alphabetical essence, can be soon part
of your knowledge, why should you miss it?

For this Abnormalia is made, its goal is to be eaten by your mental mouth, to be
digested  by your neuronal stomach, to be assimilated by your cerebral intestine
and  maybe,  somewhen  in  the future, to be defecated by your oral anus, in the
shape  of  new  words,  new  ideas,  new  messages  which have a far root in the
Abnormalia world of words.

Knowledge is not possible without communication.
Our  communication  is in a simple, juvenile, superficial english, but you could
have something also from it.
Also the humblest tree can make food of the sun.
Abnormalia's  words  could  be new humble food from the solar world of ideas and
dreams where human minds like to float.

Where ends communication, light switches off.
