  2                             by Mike Smithwick


To all AmiGuys and AmiGals!

I  know that I am not really supposed to talk about it, but hell, non-disclosure
agreements are just pieces of paper, aren't they??  So what follows is a summary
of  the  events  and  non-events  that  went  on  at the recent Amiga Developers
Conference and Glee Club Tryouts.

We  arrived  at  the  conference  on  January  25,  Monday.   For early arrivals
Commode-door  was  holding  additional  seminars.   One was "Introduction to Mac
Programming", and the other taught by Mehdi Aleeeeeeee!!!!  was called "Managing
Your Business for Failure-A Case Study".

After  signing  up  everyone received their conference notes in 27 convenient 3"
binders, a handcart and a free CDTV.

That  evening  they  held  a banquet and inbetween frequent visits to the DevCon
Kissing  Booth  (thanks to Cathy), the Jolt concessions and tryouts for the Mark
Barrett  Whine-Alike  contest we begin to hear about the adventures in store for
us  in  the  upcoming  4  days.  We were tipped off about the new Elvis chipset,
featuring  the  regular Elvis chip for the low-end Amigas, and the Fat-Elvis for
the  high  end  models with the option jewelled cape.  We also heard the NewDrek
was  coming, and that they had rented out EPCOT for what was billed as a "Little
NewDrek Family Get-together".

That  next  morning we reconvened for the keynote speech covering new directions
for  Commode-door.   We  learned  that  Commode-doors new direction for 1993 was
"left  and down the hall" as compared to their 1992 direction of "turn right, go
down a block and make another right at the beauty parlor, you can't miss it".  I
assume that this made sense to someone.

After  this  was  a talk on future hardware and software.  Not only did we learn
more  about  the  Elvis  chipset,  they also talked about the new Elvis.lib, the
Elvis.emulator  package  and  Elvis  boopsi  objects  and datatypes.  The entire
interface  was  going  to be modified to take advantage of these "powerhouse new
capabilities".   "What other computer will talk to you the way Elvis would?" the
CA  marketing  guy  told  us.  He then typed in something on the machine and the
Elvis-narrator.device  kicked  in  "Would'ja  please insert one of them disks?",
which  he  did.   The  computer  then replied "Thank-you, thank- you very much".
This  is meant to be only the first of many CEKs (Celebrity Enhancement Kits) to
be  made  available.  If, God-forbid, you're not an Elvis fan, you may have your
choice  of other PMs (Personality Modules), going all of the way from Elmer Fudd
("Harddwive  wead  ewwor, hehehehehehehe!") to the Dr_Ruth.lib ("All you haff to
do  is to please insert disk").  Developers have already begun to take advantage
of  these  features, from NewDrek's Elvis effect (best observed when one is in a
highly drug induced state) to Electronic Arse's "Deluxe Elvis Construction Set".
ASDFG  also showed off their "Morph Elvis Plus" in which anything can be morphed
into  looking  like  The  King.  SunFries likewise demonstrated their "Studio 54
Disco Board".

Right  after  this  we  heard  a  double-sonic boom over the hotel.  Rushing out
visitors  were  treated  to  the sight of NewDrek's own private Space Shuttle on
final  approach.   At  last,  I thought, I could finally meet that great NewDrek
babe,  Kiki  Jackhammer!   Star of the Video Roasters special Power Tools effect
series.

From  then  on the sessions broke up into about 129 different parallel meetings,
covering  topics  from  "FuzzyLogic  As  Applied to Commode-door's Marketing" to
"Localizing  you  Software  for  Arkansas".  This brings to mind one of the main
thrusts  of  the entire conference, namely localization issues.  For instance we
learned all about the new keymaps, from the Arkansas keymap (everything types an
"X")  to one for Linear-B to handle that ancient Sumarian market.  At this time,
CA  also  announced their bringing back of the beloved "Guru" error.  But due to
the  increased  "diversity"  of the Amiga market, a new sensitivity was awakened
inside  Commode-door,  so  as  with  everything else the Guru was localized.  In
Japan  it will read "Shinto priest meditation error".  Machines shipped to South
America  will  use  the  Madonna  (this  may be a mistake due to the fact that a
machine running the beta release of this software had 14 shrines built around it
overnight  following  an  Illegal address error.  However 78 miraculous healings
were  also  reported testifying to the power of the new OS mods).  Machines sent
to the far East will use the Buddha, French boxes, Jerry Lewis, and Fidel Castro
goes to certain pockets in Berkeley.

Around noon the NewDrek entourage arrived, pulling up in 42 stretch limos out in
front  of  the  hotel.   The  first  14  limos contained nothing but bodyguards,
off-duty defensive linesmen hired away from Forty Niners.  Then came the NewDrek
engineers, who were quickly whisked away by the adoring press after tossing some
flower  petals  our way.  Finally Tim Geniusson stepped out, put a clenched fist
in  the  air  and  yelled  "Roaster!  Roaster!  Roaster!".  He then approached a
microphone, and the crowds stilled.  He thanked everyone for coming to the Video
Roaster Power Supply Developers Conference, tossed some diamonds into the throng
and mysterious vanished.

A number of disks were handed out to the attendees.  A new SetPatch was supplied
which came on only 14 disks.

The  following  day  we  heard  about the new interface standards.  Peter Hernia
opened  up  the  advanced  Intuition meeting by announcing "up to now, GUIs have
only  addressed  2  of our senses, sight and hearing, ignoring 3 other perfectly
good senses, those of taste, touch and smell.  Well, wait no longer!".  Beaming,
Peter  then  began  to demonstrate several new features such as the proportional
"Scratch and Sniff" object.  He gave a sample of the source code:


      smellgad.ng_GadgetText="Lean close and sniff really really hard!";
      smellgad.ng_GadgetSmell=SNG_PORCUPINE_MUCUS;


      gadget=CreateGadget(SMELL_KIND,gad,&smellgad,TAG_DONE);


Commode-door  will  supply a scent.lib used by the datatypes, and users are free
to  add  their  own.   Supplied smells include those for a dead skunk, Madonna's
armpits,  Sushi  in  a  hot car, Calvin Klien's Obsession and wax.  Beta testers
have been reporting one fairly major bug however, which seems to make everything
smell  like  dead skunk.  That could explain why the first 12 rows were empty in
the meeting room.

He  followed  this  by mentioning the "Point and Lick" extensions still in their
early  stages  and  showed  the  optional  tongue  electrodes  needed  to "fully
appreciate"  the  new  features.  For some reason, Peter refused to demonstrate,
saying something about the smell bug also affecting the taste code.

Extensions were likewise shown for BOOPSI.  The new "OOPSI" modules were created
for the clumsy programmers out there.

At  this  time, members from the Kansas City Royals handed out flyers announcing
the  release  of NewDrek's, BlightWave 3.0.  Current owners may upgrade for only
$42,199.  "A FULL $150 OFF OF THE REGULAR PRICE!".

Besides  the  seminars,  Commode-door  had  special  rooms  set  aside for other
activities.   They had the "Compatibility Lab" so developers could try out their
products  on  a  variety  of  equipment.   Next  to  that  was  the  BLAZEMONGER
Compatibility  lab, so developers could try out their products while BLAZEMONGER
was running at the same time, in the SAME ROOM!  I never went in there as it was
always  just  a  bit  crowded  due  to  the presence of half of the Orlando fire
department  and the NEST team supplied courtesy of the Atomic Energy Commission.
I  did  notice  that  Commode-  door  thoughtfully  provided  free psychological
counseling  to  anyone  after  using the lab.  There was a long line for this as
well.  (Side note :  On the third day, ABC's Nightline did a live broadcast from
in  front  of  the  lab  door.  I didn't have time to see what they were talking
about, but I caught Koppel mentioning something about "how could anyone let this
happen",   and  the  words  "careless",  "irresponsible"  and  "Chernobyl"  were
overheard as I rushed to the Marketing seminar.)

In  the  Marketing  meetings, Dave Goldenarches revealed some of the preliminary
sales  figures for the Amiga 1200.  He announced that the Central African market
has  finally  opened  up,  and  they've sold over 9500 units in only 10 weeks in
Botswana  alone.   And  16000 machines were sent to Cambodia just for Christmas!
This was followed by the US Marketing rep who boasted that a full 28 Amiga 1200s
were  shipped  in December and that they had orders in hand for at least another
12 units.

A new "PowerDown" program was revealed in which C-64 owners could trade in their
system  for  a  CDTV.   If  they wanted, the C-64 could be bought back for $1.19
which could be traded in again if desired.

In  between  the  afternoon  meetings,  various  goodies  were  handed  out.  On
Wednesday we received free Dove Bars.  On Thursday, it was CDTVs.  Friday due to
popular  demand, more Dove Bars were given out, as well as CDTVs.  In understand
that the extra CDTVs were sent to a local landfill.

Thursday  night was "NewDrek" night at EPCOT.  We were ushered in to the park by
colorful  characters  dressed  as  Penn  and  Teller  (goofy ponytails and nails
through  their  arms) or Kiki Jackhammer (leather pants, splitting at the seam).
After  the  catered  French banquet, Michael Jackson performed for a few minutes
followed  by a reunion of the remaining 3 Beatles.  Next, Tim came out and spoke
briefly,  announcing that the next DevCon would be held in Topeka, Kansas, which
he  had  just  bought  (Kansas, not Topeka).  President Clinton wound things up,
announcing that he had just made Tim Ambassador to God.

The  show  restarted,  SDI  lasers  were  used  to  burn "NEWDREK" on the moon's
surface.   (Too  bad  about that 747 that wandered into the beam though, but Tim
brought out his checkbook and promised to take care of things).

As  we left the each attendee was handed a numbered key and directed towards the
parking  lot.   There  we saw a literal sea of red Ferraris.  Tim said that they
had considered handing out free T-shirts, but "everyone hands out T-shirts".

On  Friday  morning  we  had  the  Mark  Barrett  working group.  New flags were
introduced into the driver support code to filter out anything from Mark Barrett
that   might   get   through.    These  included  MB_ANNIALLATE,  MB_BLAST,  and
FORCE_MB_TO_SMELL_PORCUPINE_MUCUS.

Commode-door  unveiled their new Mumbly-PEG board, but no one could explain just
what  it  did.   To  answer  the complaints of no SCSI support in the A4000 they
showed  off  there  new interface card supporting the SCSI-4 standard!  Shipping
date  is  whenever  SCSI-4  is  established.   To  support  that  ever expanding
graphics-computer-multimedia  agricultural market we were shown the EIEIO board,
able to control 12 milking machines simultaneously.

We  saw the new ABCDTV prototype, dubbed the "3DO Killer" because if placed near
a  3DO  unit  it  would  explode.   During  the  demo,  the  Arkansas keymap was
accidentally loaded so all text on the screen was rendered as "X"s.

Commode-door  had  a  store available to all attendees selling things like Amiga
keychains, CD-ROMs, Dave Haynie pinups, and notes from past conferences.  Buyers
were given free CDTVs for each purchase over $1.25.

Also on Friday, we were given a peek at the new chipset, dubbed the "AA killer".
Details   about  these  chips  have  already  been  revealed  at  the  World  of
Commode-Door, but they did mention a new HAM-24 mode (set with the "Sagan" bit),
able to display "billyuns and billyuns" of colors at once.

Motorola  came  in  to  talk  of future CPUs, after the 68040 is going to be the
680486, capable of "emulating" popular chips by other manufacturers.  Then comes
the 680586, capable of "emulating" popular Motorola chips.

The  retargetable  graphics  seminar  was popular.  We were told that the design
goal  was  to permit Amiga graphics to be displayable on any device.  Not just a
display  device,  but  ANY device.  The engineers explained that in the lab they
already  had  Workbench  displaying  on  a  washing  machine,  a Sears Craftsman
powerdrill  and  Mr.   Coffee.   They were at a loss to explain as to why anyone
would want to display workbench on their Mr.  Coffee, but were quick to add that
the Amiga "would be the first computer to do so!".  They had a point there.

On  Friday night there was a field-trip to the local topless bar, notably absent
were  most  of  the  developers  who  stayed  back  at  the  hotel building play
fortresses out of CDTV units.

The  last  day  of  the  conference  began with a talk about the App-BodyBuilder
software.   Not  only  does it help build nice interfaces, it will pump up those
flaccid  biceps as well.  This requires a the new "PowerMouse" weighing in at 25
pounds.

The conference ended with a "Developer's Choice Awards Luncheon", in which Amiga
developers  were asked to vote for their favorite products.  Best interface went
to NextStep, best hardware was the Pentium chip, Best Software awarded to Ultima
Underground.   It  was  decided that next year, winners will be limited to Amiga
only  products.   The conference ended with drawings for door prizes.  The first
prize  was  5  CDTVs,  the  second  prize  3 CDTVs, and third prize was an Amiga
keychain.   The  conference  ended  with a group tour of Disney World, now named
NewDrek World.

As  I  was  climbing  aboard the plane to head on home I heard that NewDrek just
bought the planet.


P.S.  Portions of this report were inspired by Steve Pietrowicz one dull January
night inbetween top-10 lists.  Gee, I need to get out more often.
