Summary: Commodore's annual retort

Keywords: prang, gleep

    OK, everybody, you can stop arguing about Commodore's annual
report.  It's all pointless now.  I just got this off CompuBixLink.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


    COMMODORE INTERNATIONAL BOUGHT OUT BY "MYSTERY" COMPANY
          HOSTILE TAKEOVER LEAVES 18 DEAD, 2 MISSING

WEST CHESTER, Pa.  -- November 3, 1991 -- Personal computer manufacturer
Commodore International, makers of the popular "Amiga" computer, was the
target of a hostile computer takeover yesterday.  Several prominent analysts
have called the takeover the "fastest and most violent ever witnessed" in
the history of American business.

At approximately 4:15am Eastern Standard Time, the attacker struck.  The
exact method of attack is still not known, but witnesses report that the
entire operation was accompanied by "really, really mind-blowing graphics,
animation and sound."  Police on the scene immediately ruled out Apple and
IBM as suspects.

"It was terrifying," said one ex-CBM employee who requested anonymity.  "I
don't think I've ever been in a more frightening situation.  Everything
happened so fast.  One minute, I was sitting at my terminal, hacking OS 2.06,
and the next... I was flat on my back in the middle of the front lawn,
surrounded by flames.  I could swear I heard demonic laughter, explosions,
and the grinding of heavy machinery.  Only one thing's for sure:  whatever
it was, it happened fast.  I mean, really fast.  And violent."

Irving Gould, former CEO of Commodore, was unavailable for comment.  All of
Mr. Gould's 6,595,338 shares of Commodore stock were found shredded in the
basement of CBM headquarters.  Poor Poopsie.

The identity of the marauding corporation is still unknown, but FBI agents
are beginning to pick up the trail.  "We did find one small clue," said FBI
Inspector Reginald P. Blarno, "when we examined the tragic scene from
several hundred feet up in the air.  It looks like somebody took a gigantic
can of spray-paint and wrote the words 'BLAZEMONGER WINS AGAIN' on the roof
of the building.  We don't who this 'BLAZEMONGER' person is yet, but we have
a few leads."

------------

    Wow!  I wonder who did it?  I guess all we can do now is wait and
see if the "mystery corporation" will come forward.

    [Heh heh.]

    Dammit, Mike -- there you go, violating your non-disclosure
agreement.  Oh well, now that the topic is out in the open, I might as
well talk about it.

    Yes, it's true:  Commodore has hired BLAZEMONGER, INC. to do its
next generation of television commercials!  Thanks to the astounding,
universal success of our BLAZEMONGER and PHRASEMONGER products, we were
approached by Commodore at last year's DEVCON and the deal was made.

    Here is a SPECIAL PREVIEW of the first upcoming Amiga commercial by
the MARKETING GENIUSES at BLAZEMONGER, INC.  Our predictions show that at
LEAST 90,000 sales will result directly from each broadcast of this
commercial... GUARANTEED!

    It begins with soothing music and a scene of ocean waves lapping
gently at the shore of a tropical island beach.  A voice says:

    "Just imagine...

        ... a computer so amazing, so powerful, that the
            most difficult tasks execute with blinding speed.

    [A flash of lightning strikes a palm tree and causes a bright
     explosion.  The beach-goers flee in terror.]

        ... a computer so fast, simple to use, that it takes you
            higher than the height of the highest heights.

    [Cut to a view of the earth from the US Space Shuttle.  Australia is
     cleverly labeled "AMIGA" for a touch of subliminal advertising.]

        ... a machine so advanced that it can operate an electron
            microscope, yet so friendly that it licks your face.

    [Cut to an X-ray diagram of a large dog.]

        ... a computer than can do ANYTHING!

    [Cut to HAM picture of a size 41 girdle covered with maple syrup.]

        WELL?!?  WHY DON'T YOU *OWN* ONE, STUPID?????  Are you just
        IGNORANT NATURALLY, or did you have PAINFUL SURGERY to attain
        TOTAL BRAINLESSNESS????

    [Cut to the flag of whatever nation is watching the commercial,
     waving in the simulated wind.]

        The Amiga is the ULTIMATE, ULTIMATE computer -- EVERYBODY
        knows that.  So get WITH it, DOOOD!!!  Any OTHER computer
        isn't worth the GRIMY DIRT on its RETURN KEY!  BLEAH!!!

    [Cut to silicon-chip cleanroom.]

        First, we've got HARDWARE.  Oy, do we got hardware.  The
        HARDEST in the INDUSTRY!!  Our chips are made of a secret
        TITANIUM STEEL/DIAMOND ALLOY, covered with MOLTEN LEAD and
        garnished with a sprig of PARSLEY!  [Cut to Julia Child,
        nodding approval.]

    [Cut to shelves and shelves of software.]

        Then, we've got SOFTWARE.  You NAME it, we GOT it.  Graphics,
        programming tools, games, word processors, games, and
        other stuff!!

    [Cut to successful-looking business office, full of good-looking
     businesspeople.  Way in the back of the picture is Irving Gould,
     stacking money into neat piles.]

        Business applications?  OF COURSE!!  MILLIONS of business
        applications!!  BILLIONS of them!!!!!  Oh yes!  For instance,
        for instance, er, um, uh... uh..., yeah, LOTS of business
        applications!!!  TONS of them!!!

    [Cut to scientists in lab coats with "Amiga" decals.  One of them
     looks not entirely unlike Dave Haynie (or Peter Cherna... whoever
     is cheaper).]

        Finally, there's the OPERATING SYSTEM:  the most ADVANCED
        operating system on the PLANET.  Multitasking?  You GOT it!
        Run ANY NUMBER of applications SIMULTANEOUSLY to your
        HEART'S DESIRE!!

    [A low, ominous rumble begins...]

        And of course, ONLY the Amiga runs the most DEVASTATING game
        ever produced:  BLAZEMONGER '92!!!

    [Cut to actual footage of the Nagasaki atomic bomb, followed by a
     short but bloody animation of dying children being eaten alive by
     Nancy Reagan.]

        So do the SMART thing today... and buy AMIGA!  Made by
        COMMODORE, who is not a games-machine factory.

        AMIGA:  Making the Imagination of Tomorrow Make Today's
            Imagination Possible... Today!"
            <Catchy, eh??>

    So there you have it -- our commercial!  It will air for the first
time tomorrow night on ZBS.  Watch for it!



2Press release: BLAZEMONGER backs out!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

       BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED TO CEASE SELLING POPULAR GAME

WEST CHESTER, Pa.  -- February 10, 1992 -- BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED,
authors of the popular "ViolentWare" software series, announced
yesterday that they were taking their top-selling product, BLAZEMONGER,
off the market.

"We have just ended some successful negotiations with Commodore," said Dan
Barrett, official B.Inc. spokescreature, "and afterwards decided to pull
BLAZEMONGER from production.  I cannot give any more details without
violating a non-disclosure agreement, but I will say that we are very happy."

The latest meeting between BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED and Commodore Business
Machines capped off months of speculation about a possible collaborative
effort between the two computer giants.  Commodore, maker of the popular
Amiga microcomputer, has been in need of improved graphics technology.
BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED is best known for the stunning graphics and sound
in its products.  Could there be a connection?

"I seriously doubt it," said top market analyst Mirk Birritt.  "I predicted
over five hundred years ago that Blazemonger [sic] and Commodore would try to
team up, but it's hopeless.  Commodore will never be anything more than a
little speck of slime on the bottom of my business school diploma."

On the other hand, some advocates have other views.  "I think this is a
wise move," said one source named Dave who asked not to be identified.
"After all, when the copper hits the VBL, hundreds of MMU cycles can be
gated without adding bus contention to the whiffle."  Key spokespeople
from Apple, IBM, and NeXT were quick to deny the charges.

Regardless, rumors are still flying.  Once source claimed that Commodore is
licensing the as-yet-unheard-of BLAZEMONGER Advanced Chip Set.  Another
source reported that B.Inc. plans to market a "standalone" BLAZEMONGER box
with an Amiga inside.  A third source claimed to know that the two
companies are collaborating on a new computer called the BlaZinga.  "It will
have forty-thousand bits per pixel," he said, "and an infrared mouse with
eighty buttons."

Perhaps the mostly likely case is that Commodore is working on its own entry
in the "ViolentWare" series.  "It will be called GOULDMONGER," said one
insider, who refused to give any further details, except to promise that it
will be "everything that the Amiga advocates would expect in a game of this
name."  Further research indicates that the game is supposedly being written
by disgruntled employees at Commodore.

Even with the promise of new technology on the horizon, some BLAZEMONGER
owners are outraged.  "I can't BELIEVE they are abandoning us!" said an
angry Baird Macintoosh.  "I mean, they are even closing down their
'900-number' hint line!  Don't they realize that some of us need those hints
on a daily basis??  This is terrible... I'm going to have to switch to a
different game now, like 'Eye of the Potholder'."

What will happen next?  Only time will tell.  But sources say to watch
USENET carefully for future product announcements.

>Re: Mac vs. Amiga (was Re: Amiga vs. Mac (was Re: Amiga vs. NeXT

    All of you comp.sys.amiga.AIRHEAD readers don't know what you
are TALKING ABOUT.  It is TOTALLY OBVIOUS to me that NONE of you has
*EVER* USED A COMPUTER.

    You can just BAG those '486 slowpokes.  TOSS OUT those boring
Macinsloths.  And feed your WIMPY NEXTS to RABID ARMADILLOS!!  If you want
to experience the ULTIMATE in personal computer GRAPHICS, personal computer
SPEED, and personal computer HYGIENE, then there is ONLY ONE CHOICE.
Count it:  ONE (1).  Can you count that high?  I knew you could.

    [Yes, you knew it was coming, didn't you...]

    Announcing...

                B L A Z E - P C

THE MOST SPLENDIFERAMAZINGTASTIC PERSONAL COMPUTER EVER CREATED!!!!!!
(From BLAZEMONGER, INC:  makers of fine games for psychopathic individuals.)

    Anyway, you ask, "How fast is Blaze-PC?"  That's a very reasonable
thing to ask, so we'll tell you.

    [Long-time BLAZEMONGER fans can skip the next paragraph.]

    FIRST OF ALL, buddy, it's BLAZE-PC IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS!!!
If you don't SCREAM when you WRITE IT, your COMPUTATIONS BITE IT!! (TM)

    So, is it FAST??  HAH!!!!  Words haven't been INVENTED YET to
describe the BLAZING, RAW PROCESSING POWER of BLAZE-PC.  To combat this
problem, we are now contacting WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY to add a new word that
DOES describe it!!  This word will be the FASTEST word EVER CREATED!!  It's
so fast that every time you try to look it up, it JUMPS to another page!!
This word is IMPOSSIBLE to read!  So you'll just have to take our word for
it.

    How about graphics and audio?  GET REAL!!!  Other WIMPY PC's have
24-bit graphics and stereo 16-bit sound.  NOT BLAZE-PC!!!  BLAZE-PC has
24-MEGABIT graphics (yes, 24,000,000 bits per pixel) and 16-CHANNEL sound
arranged as 4 independent QUADRAPHONIC systems -- one system at ear level,
one above you, one below you, and one in the FOURTH DIMENSION!!

    In addition, BLAZE-PC supports VGA, EGA, XVGA, IGA grocery stores,
and even new *UGA* ("Universal Graphics Acronym") for the ULTIMATE in
COMPATIBILITY!  And yes, it emulates the Amiga CUSTOM CHIPS, plus all
available 3rd party, 4TH PARTY, and 117TH PARTY graphics boards at SIXTEEN
MILLION HILLION JILLION TIMES THE SPEED!!!  It even emulates the HEADLIGHTS
on your ancient '73 FORD MUSTANG!!!  Yes, ANYTHING involving LIGHT or COLOR
pales in comparison to the AWESOME, SPINE-TINGLING GRAPHICS of BLAZE-PC.

    But what about software?  BLAZE-PC has the BEST software in the
KNOWN UNIVERSE.  In fact, EVERY major and minor software manufacturer has
agreed to port their applications to BLAZE-PC, so there's total freedom of
choice and no compatibility issues!  How did we do it?  Simple -- we sent
our "Customer Service Representatives" around to all the companies to...
uh... "convince" them to port their programs.  Our Reps are EXPERTS.  No
company has EVER turned them down and remained in business.  The last company
that refused to port its software had a mysterious EXPLOSION occur at its
disk-copying facility.  A few days later, several employees got their TONGUES
caught in the disk drives.  Within a week, the company was gone.  Of course,
we don't know WHY this all happened.  But it is never a good idea to piss
off our Customer Service Department.

    And if you can't afford to buy commercial software, check out
BLAZE-PD, the ULTIMATE freely-distributable application!!  It is a
combination paint program, structured graphics program, word processor,
spreadsheet, database, MIDI sequencer, sound sampler, and ARCADE GAME (guess
which one) all in one integrated package, communicating through a new
interprocess-communication language called A-WRECKS.  A-WRECKS has the
AMAZING feature of being able to talk to ALL YOUR PROGRAMS at once!!  How
does A-WRECKS do it?  Simple -- by YELLING AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE!!!  Any rude
application that refuses to listen is automatically BLOWN INTO A MILLIONS
PIECES by A-WRECKS's special "Cleanup" command.

    "So," you ask, "how much does Blaze-PC cos... no, wait!  Put that
sledgehammer down!!  I mean, how much does *BLAZE-PC* cost?"  Now THAT is a
fine and well-stated question (luckily for you).  The answer is:  CHEAP!!
Yes, you can buy a BLAZE-PC for less money that you'd expect to pay for a
BALL POINT PEN!!  They're SO INEXPENSIVE that if we paid you to buy one,
you'd be a MILLIONAIRE in TEN SECONDS!!  NOBODY beats our prices.

    Of course, that price doesn't include some of the available OPTIONS,
such as a CPU and memory.  Those are "extra."  (Heh heh.)  But don't
worry... if you need them but can't afford them, just call our "Customer
Service" Department.

    So... aren't you glad that all of these c.s.a.advocacy arguments are
now POINTLESS?  There is NO other computer worth owning except the BLAZE-PC.
It does EVERYTHING.  Take one home, flip the switch, and INSTANTLY all of
your home financial calculations are complete!!  You don't even have to PLUG
IT IN!!  And when you read your final bank balance, notice that it is
ZERO, and discover that all of your money has been mysteriously channeled
to a Swiss bank account owned by an anonymous software company, you will
KNOW the INCREDIBLE POWER of BLAZE-PC.

    In fact, this POWER is echoed in our new slogan:

            BLAZE-PC:  Buy it or die.

(Are you listening, Commodore Marketing?  No, I suppose not... you're
probably out buying blindfolds.)

    Oh, so you think a "smiley face" will get you off the hook, eh?
FORGET IT!!  Let's see what my beta copy of PHASEMONGER III has to say:

    [Click on "Really Not Nice" gadget]

        "Wasting tax money???  HAH!!  If you were any more
        HIPPOCRITICAL then you'd be in a HOSPITAL for LARGE ZOO
        ANIMALS!!  Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, what do you think YOU are

    [time passes...]

    [Amiga explodes.]

Sigh.  Well, it seems that PHRASEMONGER III still has some bugs.  Anyway,
the point it should have made is that posting lots of BLAZEMONGER
announcements actually SAVES tax money!!  Yes!!  Just ask anyone!!  And if
you want to know HOW to save money yourself, pick up a copy of our new book,
"Tax Backdoors:  How To 'Convince' the I.R.S. of ANYTHING."  It is written,
of course, by our "Customer Service" Department.

    WRONG-O, DWEEB-FACE!!  This shows how LITTLE you know about
BLAZE-PC.  Maybe it's true on all those other, WIMPY PSEUDO-COMPUTERS
that you TAKE TO BED every night, but NOT for the One True Computer,
BLAZE-PC.

    You see, BLAZE-PC uses *exactly* 1,000 bytes per kilobyte.  This is
the way that computers were MEANT to be built.  If GOD had intended
computers to have 1,024 bytes per kilobyte, HE/SHE would have given us
SIXTEEN FINGERS!!  Powers of ten are the ONLY way to go, and in fact account
partly for BLAZE-PC's MIND-BLOWING SPEED.

    And now, for all you other LOSERS who keep asking about BLAZE-PC's
graphics resolution (which we didn't mention), it should be totally OBVIOUS
what the answer is.  NO, it's not 1024x1024 or some other BLAZEPHEMOUS
resolution.  In fact, BLAZE-PC's graphics resolution is 10x10!!  Yes,
ten pixels by ten pixels.  You see, BLAZE-PC is SO POWERFUL that even
with 100 pixels, it BLOWS THE COMPETITION OUT OF THE WATER!!  Each pixel
can have over 100,000 different colors SIMULTANEOUSLY, and can be SIZED
from infinitely small all the way up to cover the entire screen!  These
pixels are SO VERSATILE that it requires only 2 pixels to display the
MONA LISA!!  And it's INDISTINGUISHABLE from the ORIGINAL PAINTING!!!
(In fact, one morning we discovered a dead art thief on the floor by
our computer.  He tried to cut out the painting using a knife, and hit
a capacitor.  Poor Poopsie.)
