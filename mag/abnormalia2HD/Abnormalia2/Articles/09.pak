That  was  too  much  even for Mr Smith.  He had always had patience when he was
alive,  he  accepted  also  that little and uncomfortable coffin that his stingy
relatives  had  bought  him,  but  when you see insects and spiders entering and
starting to bite your body, you are not happy at all.
The  decomposition  was  already  enough, with those bacteries having their long
lunches on his meat, but insects!  They are faster and hurt more.
It's not igienic too, Mr Smith thought, they can bring some disease with them, I
can't always keep my mouth closed.

To  contact his mates was easy, at the first spiritualist seance he took control
just  few  seconds  after  being  invoked  and  he  started  to spread the news.
Cadavers  on  strike!   Time  to  protest for the absurd conditions where we are
compelled  to die!  Larger and cleaner coffins!  He shouted this and more, among
some  terrified living humans, the ones who imprudently had made the seance, and
many  bodies  from  the ground started to agree and assure their support for the
initiative.

Soon  the voice flew from tomb to tomb, from cimitery to cimitery, in a while it
was  heard  by  all the deads of the world and they started to discuss about the
idea of a strike, about the means to express their disapproval for their general
decaying  condition.   It  was  the  first time that something similar happened,
usually  the  deads didn't talk much, they preferred to enjoy eternity silently,
but  this  time  it was different, it could be the right moment to fix a pair of
annoying things.

It  is  to  be  said that these deads were a bunch of disorganized and anarchist
guys,  everybody  was  shouting  his opinion, without listening the others' one,
without  caring of the living people, who, meanwhile, were all terrified hearing
whisperings and voices, howls and rattles, yums and yawns from everywhere.

While  the  world of the livings was in the hands of panic, the one of the deads
was  in  total confusion, with different trends of opinions and ideas mixing and
fighting in endless quarrels.  Mrs Jones for example, was happy of her condition
and  was  quite  angry for all the noise that the others were doing.  She didn't
like to interrupt her eternal sleep.

Others  were  saying  that  the world of the living humans was too dangerous for
them,  there were unnable and terrible things out there, only a mad could try to
exit.   Mr  Smith  somehow  managed  to  took the control and organize a sort of
rappresentative bunch, whose aim was to talk with the leaders of the livings and
obtain some kind of compromise.

The crusade in the realm of the living people was planned for the following day,
of  the  little  group at the orders of Mr Smith there were Lord John, noble and
gentle  corpse,  once  belonged to a Lord called John (not surprisingly indeed),
Miss Janet, very attractive skeleton, with white and thin bones, being dead many
years  before.   The  fourth  of  the  company  was  Maccio,  a  kid in advanced
decompotion  conditions, whose importance was unknown for everybody (actually he
was  the  son  of  a  friend of the brother of Mr Smith, who had to make favours
around after all the popularity he had obtained).

To  see  these  four  zombies coming out from the earth probably wasn't the best
aspiration of Dick the grave-digger, but anyway that was not the problem.
Something more serious happened when the dynamic quartet reached the town center
spreading panic and nausea, due to the not exactly fair smell of their bodies.

When  they  started  to  be shooted by the army, the police and the water gun of
Billy the kid they realized that maybe they weren't so pleasant as they thought.
When  Mr  Smith  asked  to the bazooka of a marine to talk with the President he
received  a  enormous  hole  in  the  face.  The fact that he didn't care of his
external beauty was, now, an important achievement.

Soon  anyway Janet started to moan about the lack of cosmetics for dead women in
the  world  of the living monsters.  She was really disappointed and was already
regretting  the  time  she  could  spend  in  her  grave  talking  with her tomb
neighbour, Ted nice head, whose skull was utterly sexy.
Anyway  they  had  a  mission  and  for this mission they were travelling in the
universe of fallax pangs of life.

When  finally they proved that their intentions were peaceful (this the generals
had  wanted  to  believe  after having used three nuclear bombs, half hydrogenum
bomb  and a petard on the four brave knights of darkness) things really changed.
The  President  came and they showed their doubts and worries for the conditions
of  the graves.  There is much corruption among the undertakers, they said, they
are  cheating  the  cadavers,  they  use  bad  materials and few care.  Our four
walking  bodies  retended also larger and better coffins.  Conditioned air, bar,
stereo  system  and  television  included.   Possibly  also  with  the satellite
receiver to watch MTV and its bunch of dead tongues.

The  President  asked,  quite  boldly  "And if I don't accept?  What do you do??
What can YOU do to ME???".
Mr  Smith  just  breathed  directly  on the face of the President, who winced in
utter  disgust,  then,  our brave and cheeky hero said:  "Do you see this child?
He  is Maccio and he needs a new father, a new adoptive family and all that sort
of  things.   Take  him back in the world of running lives if you don't want the
general  and  ultimate  strike  of  the frustrated cadavers.  Either this or the
same.  Make your choice".

It  was  a compromise, he knew that but few minutes and half of the Earth bellic
power had immediately made him understand how the things were going in the world
of  the  living humans.  He wanted to come back to his grave as soon as possible
but  he  couldn't  come  back  to  his  mates  with  no  meat on the hands.  The
resurrection of Maccio could be a good prize for the general strike, he thought,
sure  that  it was better not to change the situations of the graves if not just
for  some  softer  willows,  but  not much more.  The pollusion of life could be
quite dangerous for them.

Despite his age and his well developed arteriosclerosis he was sure to have made
the  right  move.   The situation was hot and he had been cold as a...  deadman,
there was nothing better to do.

He  knew  that  the President was a friend of the Pope, who was supposed to be a
near  friend  of God, a good word here, a pray there and Maccio could go back to
his  world,  where  he  could  find  his  father again, the friend of Mr Smith's
brother, who happened also to be the cousin of the grave-digger of his cemetery.
Nothing  is made for nothing, Mr Smith thought smiling and waiting for the reply
of  the President who was wondering in the meanwhile if all this could be a good
thing for his rielection campaign.

All  the good stories must have some ball breaker to break the balls, here there
was  The General Balle, a very serious and therefore dumb general whose duty was
to be the general of some kind of army.

Generally  the General didn't use to talk much, his mouth, as his soldiers liked
to  tell,  was  a cannon and his words were some good nuclear missiles (also for
this  reason, maybe, it was born the legend that no woman had survived to a kiss
of his).  But this time he changed a few his manners:  "Me not agree, me destroy
them",  he more or less managed to say and suddenly he ordered to his soldier to
pour on the four walking skeletons some billions of ammos of mysterious nature.

The President wasn't happy of this extravaganza and he finally kicked away Balle
and  his balls.  While a Yippie was already partying for the good choose (he got
arrested  ten  seconds  later  for  abuse  of  cannabis),  a tremendous howl, an
horrible  cry,  a savage scream suddenly shocked the whole country.  It was Miss
Janet,  not  completely happy of the new greenesque colour that her skeleton had
got due to the exotic substances poured on her by the armies of Balle the  balls
breaker.

Mr  Smith  was  tired.   The General Balle had really destroyed the balls and he
wasn't in the right mood to take care of few coloured bones.
He said to the President what to do, he breathed again to be more convincing and
he waited.

The President did the rest.

A  shout  to  the  whitewasher  "Ehi  there!  Come here, there are some bones to
paint!"

A  phonecall  to  the  Pope,  "Hi  Pop,  are  ya  Ok?  Listen, you gotta ask Him
something..."

A declaration to the press, "It's all Ok, I have discussed with Mister Smith and
we have reached a gentlemen's agreement..."

A phonecall to his own home, "Hi Margie, prepare the pizza, I'm coming..."


The day of the President was accomplished.

The mission of Mr Smith was accomplished.

The resurrection of Maccio was accomplished.

The bones of Miss Janet were cleaned.


After  some good five minutes of hands waving to Maccio, the three cadavers came
back to their natural place.

Once  home  they  were  asked  many interested and even interesting questions by
their friends, the excitement for the heroic mission lasted some months and then
everything came back to its natural stillness.

Few  eons later Mr Smith thought again about his "heroic" days, when the deadmen
had  came  back  to  the  world  of  the living men, when the zombies really had
returned,  when  he  talked  with  the President, when he mastered all the angry
souls  of the upset cadavers.  Good old days, but they had passed and of this Mr
Smith wasn't totally diapponted.
He closed what had remained of his eyes, ready to enjoy eternity again.
