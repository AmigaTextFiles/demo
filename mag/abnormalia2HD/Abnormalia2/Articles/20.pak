  Echoes of gay laughter and snatches of funky tunes drifted faintly on the 
  night breeze.

  Kevin HardBuckle kicked irritably at a crumpled newspaper lying on the 
  pavement.
  He felt lonely and depressed. If only he hadn't said anything!
  The sudden pain and look of deprivement in Corinne's eyes still smarted in
  Kevin's mind.
  How could he possibly have known that her brother....!

  A sudden gust of wind sent a cold shiver down Kevin's back. Irritably he
  tugged his winter cloak tighter around him, trusting his hands deep into 
  its pockets.
  Hunching his shoulders he resumed his listless walk.
  The dwindling sounds from the party still mocked and jeered at his back,
  although faintly.

  Rounding a corner, Kevin crossed the street and decided to take the short-
  cut through the city park.

  Trudging along the gravel path, Kevin wrestled with dark thoughts, which
  tumbled and churned in his head.

  After a few minutes' walk he stopped abruptly.
  An alien sense of foreboding and unease lanced through his troubled 
  thoughts, scattering them like dead leaves in a strong wind.
  Shivering slightly he glanced along the gravelly path.
  No, nothing.

  Casting an embarrassed glance over his shoulder, he smiled uneasily.
  Cripes, act your age, he admonished himself.
  His twentieth birthday was next week, wasn't it?!

  Unconsciously lengthening his stide, he hurried through the dark park.

  "What was that?"
  Was it only his imagination or had he actually heard a crunchy footfall
  on the path behind him?
  Seeking comfort in the golden glow of the tall lamp-posts bordering the 
  path, Kevin once more felt the icy fingers of dread racing down his back,
  when the lights suddenly went out!

  Probably a power-failure somewhere, he mused.
  A sudden image of the party he'd just left, flashed through his mind.
  How about that! No electricity, no music, no dancing, no laughter!
  A giggle bordering on the hysterical burst unwanted from his mouth.

  Re-focusing on the path ahead, Kevin walked slowly onwards, carefully 
  avoiding dogs' turds and other misfortunes in his path.

  There it was again! Footsteps, definitely the sound of footsteps!
  Could it be Corinne?
  Turning abruptly, his eyes scanned the dense shadows intently.

  Dark images and long shadows wavered and flickered in the faint breeze.
  His sharp glance stopped and slowly swivelled back to re-focus on a tall,
  particularly dark shadow under a large weeping-willow.
  Was someone standing there? Watching him?
  Taking tentative steps forward, Kevin slowly approached the willow.

  No, nothing. Just eerie shadows cast by the tall tree's slowly wavering
  limbs.
  And yet, something wasn't quite right.
  Swallowing nervously, Kevin stalked up to the tree and peered sharply into
  the dense shadows.
  
  A slow, faint pulsation in the dark caught his attention.
  As he closed in, a slight shimmering in the air pulled him forward.
  What could it possibly be?!

  Treading cautiously, the young man cast furtive glances at the closing 
  darkness.
  Swallowed up in the shadows, Kevin suddenly saw a faintly glittering portal
  reveal itself in front of him.
  A gate in here?

  A low, mesmerizing tune, almost like an enchanter's whisper, floated 
  alluringly from the portal.
  Momentarily forgetting his premonitions and natural reserves, Kevin slowly
  went through the portal and disappeared from sight.

  
  On the gravelly path an old man looked into the shadows under the weeping-
  willow.
  A slow, malicious smile creased the wrinkled face.
  The sorceror's magic gate had caught yet another hapless victim!
  Another candidate on his way to the Land of the Lost!!

  A thin, triumphant laughter drifted away on the night breeze and languidly
  disappeared in the darkness as the lamps along the gravel path flickered on,
  one by one.
