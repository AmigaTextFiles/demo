In  the family of elementary particles, one of the most important and strange is
surely  the  neutrino:   someone  says it's a very close relative of the nothing
since,  according  to  what is called the standard model of particle physics, it
has  neither mass nor electrical charge.  But this particle is also likely to be
the  most  common  in all the universe, since some estimates say there are about
one  million of millions neutrini for each proton, and the most elusive too:  in
fact  it  feels  only one of the four fundamental strengths (gravitational, weak
nuclear,  electromagnetic,  strong nuclear), the weak one, and this means that a
neutrino  has  a  very  high probability of crossing the whole sun without being
disturbed:   I remember a joke of a professor, who said he wanted to protect his
new  detector  from  neutrini  and  asked  us  to calculate the thickness of the
shield; well, the result was he needed an iron armor some light years thin, with
a mass much bigger than the sun!

This  capability of travelling (at the speed of light!) through the matter is at
the  basis  of several experiments upon them, but is also the main diffuculty of
these  experiments:   the idea is that in the nuclear reactions at the centre of
the sun there is a huge production of neutrini that can immediately go away from
the  sun  (while  the energy can take up to ten millions years to join the sun's
surface!):  if we could detect them, we would have direct infos upon the nuclear
reactions in the core of the sun.  Well, this is possible, even if with terrible
problems:  neutrino detectors are made of big masses of liquid with a relatively
high  (but  always  incredibly small) probability of capturing a neutrino, which
would cause an atom of the liquid to become radioactive and then to be revealed.
As  an  example,  the  first experiment of this kind was made with 600 tons of a
sort  of  cheap  detergent,  put in a mining facility about 2000 meters deep (in
order  to avoid that reactions similar to the expected could be caused by cosmic
rays:   the  neutrini  can easily join the detergent,no matter if they come from
above  or  below  the  laboratory, but other particles are absorbed by the rocks
around)  and  the  expected production was of some radioactive atom per week (in
600 tons!).  The surprise with this experiment was that the real ratio was below
the expectation, with a difference of three times.  Since it was thougt that the
branches  of  physics  regarding  nuclear  reactions  in  the stars and neutrino
detection,  were  well  known,  this  result  put  a  big  doubt  about the real
understanding  of  the  matter.   The first reaction of theoricians was (can you
doubt?) to say the experiment was wrong, but up to now several other experiments
(american,  japanese,  russian,  italian  ...)  have  confirmed  the data, using
different  kinds of liquid in order to catch neutrini of different energy :  the
experiment  which  is  closest to theoretical forecast sees less than the 60% of
the  predicted  flow.   A  lot of people tried to explain this lack, but the two
main  hypotesis  are:   i) we don't know enough about nuclear reactions in stars
ii)  something  happens  to the neutrini during the trip from the sun the second
hypotesis  is  surely  the  most developed, since it agrees with an old idea and
also  with  some  (very  uncertain)  experiments:   neutrini  could  have a mass
different from 0, and this could let them "oscillate":  I have not said yet that
there  are  three  kinds  of  neutrini (electronic, muonic and tauonic, each one
associated  with another particle, the electron, the mu and the tau) and if they
happened to have a mass, they could transform themselves from a kind to another,
so  that even if the nuclear reactions in the sun produce almost only electronic
neutrini, they could become of other kind before joining our detectors (sensible
to electronic neutrini only) and so we see a lower flow than we expect.

This  idea  of  massive neutrini has become a sort of deus ex machina in several
other  fields  of  physics and astrophysics.  The most important is likely to be
the  dark  matter  of universe:  there are theoretical reasons to think that the
mass  of the universe is much greater (up to 1000 times) than the mass we see in
stars and galaxies and several observations confirm this hypotesis, even if with
a less dramatic difference (from 10 to 50 times).  So, we ask what is this "dark
matter",  and  we  find  it cannot be "normal" (technically, "barionic") matter,
because we would see it in some way:  the theoricians are still taking out a lot
of  strange  ideas,  like  "supersymmetric  particles",  "WIMPs"  (that  is Weak
Interacting  Massive  Particles),  "photinos"...   (obviously, none of these new
particles  has  ever been seen and in most cases we can immediately give up even
the  hope  of seeing them for the next two or three centuries...), but there are
also  less  exotic proposals, starting from a lot of tiny black holes and ending
with  massive  neutrini:  I have already said that neutrini are likely to be the
most  common  particles in the universe, so, if they had a very little mass (one
part  of  a  million  of  the mass of the electron, that is the lightest massive
particle  known,  would  be  more  than  enough),  we could explain at least the
observed  mass excess and they could also be enough to "close" the universe i.e.
to  join  the  critical  mass  beyond  which  our  universe is forced to fall on
himself,  ending  in  a  "big  crunch"  that is exactly the opposite of the "big
bang", the great explosion that we think to have originated the universe.

So,this  "relative  of the nothing" could be the main component of our universe,
the particle that produced its actual form and will give its destiny.
