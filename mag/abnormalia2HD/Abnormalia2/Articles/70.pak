-It's  terrible  to  wake up early in the morning, when the sky is still full of
shining stars and the town's still in the dark, especially during the winter.
But  it's  more  terrible  to  do  it when you are deeply conscious that another
boring day on the desks of your school is beginning, among four narrow walls, in
front of those old and filthy PC 786, that only in an Italian school can be used
without  making  laugh  their  users.   We  are the only country of the European
confederation that's still using machines which could be present in a museum:
awful!...- -Oh shit!  It's eight o'clock and I'm still dressing my pajama!
Big  shit!   I've  got  my  bus  at  8:10 and if I miss I'm in dire straits!  My
teacher would bust me!- -A cup of coffee, a couple of biscuits, t-shirt and blue
jeans  smelling of stale beer because of yesterday's party and I'm ready to rush
out  into the street to catch the bus.  Just in time.  The heavy vehicle in fact
is  coming  right now.  It stops.  I get on and then it restarts.  This time I'm
almost  punctual.   A  fast  chat  with some friends of mine, always punctual as
clock,  real  creatures of habit, and then the lessons begin.  Lessons that grow
in  the  deepest  and  more  hidden  part of my soul a real sense of impatience,
lessons  that are not able to mean anything for me, that are so close but so far
from me, from my vision of the world, from my mind.
Mathematic, trigonometry, words mixed by numbers to learn by heart together with
demonstrations  without wondering who, what, where or why.  Being quick and good
hand  at  figures,  that's the only important thing for my teacher, a mad man or
maybe only a fool, and nothing else matters.
Everything,  thanks God has an end and so after math it's literature time.  I've
been  studying  literature  for three years and, day after day, I'm getting more
and  more  lover of it.  It's beautiful to spend my time at home, in front of my
AMiGA  8000+  while are scrolling Beowulf, Dante's Commedia, Petrarca's sonnets,
Chaucer's Canterbury Tales or Milton's Paradise Lost.
I've just sat on the chair, in my classroom, but my mind is already out.  What a
nice  life  I  could  have  if I were born centuries before, when literature was
beginning  its promenade:  chatting with Marlowe in a tavern or quarrelling with
Machiavelli in Florence.

But there's no need to go so far.
I  would  like to be born one hundred years later, when literature started to be
written on computers.
Yes!   Yes!!!   I  would like to be as Macno, DDT, Phoenix, Tatlin or THe RiPPeR
were.   The  first brave pioneers that changed, together with other artists, the
way of conceiving literature.
