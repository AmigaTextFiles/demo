2                                    by Macno


When you are alone on an island there is not much you can do.
Especially if the island is the back of a sleeping whale.
I  had  the  impression  that my favourite, stable and only island wasn't of the
idea  of  doing  the island for much time.  It wasn't a good island after all, I
had  seen something better in my life, I mean, the ideal island of a shipwrecked
person has a palm and a bottle to send the SOS message in.
I  just  had  this  sleeping whale, a bottle and a pen.  There just remained the
paper and then salvation could be reality.
When I remembered that I was a paper-for-photocopies-machines salesman I decided
that  it  was my lucky day.  A new life of hopes and happiness seemed to open in
front of me.
I  said  "Here  you are, paper for every use!", my favourite slogan for my firm,
and  I  showed  with  a fast and experienced move a whole pack of 500 sheets out
from my boxers.
It just remained to write my message, to sing the Police's song and to wait.
Something had to happen.

I started to write...

"Hi  there!   I  happen to be on the back of a sleeping whale now...  what about
rescuing me before it wakes up?".

Nope, too friendly, I gotta be more formal, after all this is a SOS...

"Egregious  Mr.Who-reads-this-letter,  I would like to inform you that due to an
unlucky  circumstance  I happen to lay alone on the back of a sleeping whale.  I
would  like  very  much to receive signs of your attention in order to solve the
uncommon situation.  Yours sincerely".

Well, maybe it's too much, somebody could consider it a insurance contract...

"Ehi  asshole!   What  are ya doin there???  Don't you see that I'm in a fucking
bastard situation?  Move up your ass and come here!"

Ugh,  convincing,  maybe, but a bit aggressive, let's try with the oldest weapon
who convinces every human being...

"I  am a sexy horny girl alone on a back of a lovely whale sleeping in an erotic
sea.  I just wait for you to come, my lovely macho-man..."

This  could  be  a  good  one,  but  if a woman gets it?  I should try something
else...

"We  all  know  your  situation.  You are a serious and emancipated woman who is
sure  of  her  position in the society.  Still you need and dream a powerful and
beastly  man  who  can  possess  you.  I am here, I am hard, I am alone and I am
quite in an hurry.  Come on woman!  I will dominate you just as you like!"

And  if she is a feminist?  Maybe it's better to find our target among the young
people...

"Hi  nice  boy!   Wanna  a sweet, soft, coloured sugar-drop?  If you come here I
will buy you all the chocolate you want.  Don't forget, sweet is what your teeth
need."

Well,  it  could  work,  but  after all I am in the middle of the ocean, maybe I
should invent something for the natives who live in these places...

"me greet you.  me need help.  me very hurry.  me have coloured little balls!"

Well,  I  could  also  try  something  for martians...  there are UFO everywhere
nowadays, maybe this message is good for them....

"jgiuy  iuyh iji :-) lknkjh dsflkjh perkele lh s :-!!!  lkdhfsa eli jj iuy a :-?
kiitos ;-)"

I  somehow  have the impression that it would hardly work, maybe I should be the
language of the future...

"10 Print at(rnd(74),rnd(29));"S.O.S."
 20 Goto 10"

Uhm, too lame, I gotta talk directly with the machine...

"    move.w #$4000,$dff09a
     lea    $80000,a7
     jmp    bsr

     load   $eeeabbb8
bsr: bsr    bsr"

Errr,  perhaps  I  should  make something with machines with less than 4 giga of
RAM...

"    move.w #$4000,$dff09a
     lea    $80000,a0
bra: move.l #$eeeabbb8,(a0)+
     bra    bra"

Well, better to change method, better to find hope in the good old faith...

"Saint  God, please help this humble slave, move your glorious Eyes towards this
poor  piece of dust.  May your Glory shine in all the skies, may your Word reach
every  soul  and,  first  of all, may your powerful Hands grab me away from this
unstable creature of yours.  Amen"

Damn!  I don't think that if a God exists he has time to help a poor man sending
SOS from the back of a whale...  let's try with some good marketing...

"Incredible!   Fantastic!   Exclusive!  Wanna much quality at low prices?  Wanna
the best of the least?  Come here and see personally our offers!  You will never
believe them!!!"

Or maybe this one is better...

"Join  the crew of the "Blueship" disco!  Meet new people!  Enjoy the incredible
music!   Lose  your mind in the colors and the special effects!  Come here, come
soon, the ship in blue won't wait for you!"

Gosh,  I  think  that I could have more hopes if I call directly some good brave
vikings, let's try with this...

"Heisan!   What about some free beer?  I have it, do you have something where to
put it?"

And if they are italians? Aargh, I have to write...

"Come here!  Pizza, spaghetti and pussy for everybody!  Sex and hard fuck, blond
girls just for you!"

What  a  shame,  better to drown in the sea than to see an italian around...  he
could  steal  me  even  the  clothes,  I must try with something else, something
easier  to understand, something which can be understood by everybody, something
that  can  give  an idea of the bad conditions where I am....  YES!  Here it is!
Take this one, it must work!

"S.O.S.!"
