George  was  upset,  he  wasn't  used to blind dates, actually he wasn't used to
dates at all, for this reason he tried with a blind one.
It  all  began as a normal pen pal relation.  He found her address on a magazine
for  lonely  souls  and  he decided to write, also because she was from his same
town.
It started like this, a simple letter, quite banal and superficial.  A reply and
then the reply to the reply.
George  wasn't  even  a great writer, his letters were written in a simple style
but  it  was  his  own  style and in that pieces of paper he used to write about
himself.  That seemed enough.

Slowly,  letter  after  letter, word after word, they started to know each other
better,  to  throw  away more and more formal masks, to hide themselves less and
less.
The  letters  were  many,  they took very few days to cross the town streets, he
knew where his words were delivered, he knew her address, but he had never dared
to check directly that number, to control were actually she lived.
Their  relation  got  deeper  with  time,  they  never  sent  photos, they never
commented  things  happening  to  the  world or to their town.  It was a sort of
taboo talking about it for them, they both knew that the other could be just the
anonymous  face  got  across  on the bus or in the underground, still they never
referred  to  that.   In  those  letters  there were two pure spirits, two minds
communicating,  the  bodies  and  the  lives  were  something else, not written,
thought but not said.

It  lasted  a  year,  many  many letters sent and received, always with the same
hearts bumping while opening the envelopes.  They were having an epistolary love
relation and the texts soon became love declarations.  At the end they were real
love letters, feeding a sort of platonic love.
George  at a certain point decided that he had to make the big step, to meet her
for  real  and  to  love  her  for real.  Their relation was already so firm and
established that the physical look couldn't change anything.

Love was and love had to remain.

George  knew  that  it could have been dangerous, he knew that he was physically
ugly, that was also the reason why he had put so much pathos in his letters.  It
was the only way to feed the need of love of his soul.
While  he  was  walking  to  the  date's  place he checked again his dresses, he
controlled  at  every  mirror  the  look of his hairs, he touched his pockets to
check if everything was there.

He  was  worried  and  excited,  scared and anxious.  While coming closer to the
place,  counting second after second, moving faster or slower in order to arrive
at  the right moment, not too early not too late, while walking among the town's
streets,  whose  chaos  was completely unnoticed by his eyes, he was thinking at
the first things to say, at the first acts, at the smile to offer.
The  thoughts  in  his  mind  were fluctuating in a strange and frantic state of
stillness,  no  thought  could  manage to stay fixed and it soon got lost in the
flow of other thoughts.  Without pauses, without order.

He  also was wondering what was her look; often, reading her letters he tried to
figure out how physically she was.  At the end the rational part of his mind was
sure  that  she  was  not  looking  too,  that she was as ugly and frustrated as
himself,  but his feelings, his emotional part was different.  For that half she
was beautiful and sweet, very cute and very nice.
He  thought that her look wasn't important, that he loved her the same, he loved
the  name  who  used  to sign those letters, the hands under it, the mind moving
those  hands,  what  there  could  be  covering that soul, how could be her body
wasn't important.
He  always wrote that in his letters, and she always wrote the same referring to
him.   At this point the look was just pointless, there were two loving persons,
two souls that liked each other.  The rest was useless.
With this certainty, he walked more resolute and surer of himself.

He  was  wearing a pair of blue pants and a red shirt, just like he promised and
she had to wear something that he could immediately recognize.
Finally he arrived. She didn't seem to be already there.

The   place   was  ideal,  not  very  crowded  and  not  desert,  impossible  to
misunderstand  and  easy to find, the way from which she could come was only one
and he just sat down facing that direction.
He started to smoke a cigarette, to relax, to calm down himself.
He  checked  the watch, five minutes earlier.  They had discussed much about the
time,  the  place  and  the date, and, at the end, letter after letter, they had
decided.   They  could  phone  themselves, but they didn't dare.  They had never
talked on the phone, he wondered also how could be her voice.

Time passed, every second seemed eternal, time passed and she wasn't there yet.

Often  he saw in the distance women coming closer dressed with colors that could
be  the right ones.  He then started to stare the distant point, while his heart
was  mumbling  faster  and the mouth seemed almost to freeze for the fear.  They
were  false alarms, anyway, at the end the distant dress resulted different from
the waited one, and he started to get worried.

Minutes  passed,  painful  minutes of excitement, expectation and disappointment
till resignation started to grow and invade his mind.

Half  an  hour  was passed and he was already thinking to leave, desperately sad
and resigned.

Then the moment arrived.  A new spot in the distance, new hopes, new attempts to
see  farther  than  his capabilities.  He looked and she was coming nearer, more
and more similar to what he was awaiting.
When  she  was  near enough, when he was almost sure that she was really she, he
looked in another direction and a new inferno of sensations flooded in him mind.
He  forgot  all  the acts he had prepared and thought before, he was just a ship
lost in a tempest.

She  got  closer,  looking the ground, when she was very near he raised his eyes
and looked her.

"George?"  She asked with a feeble, high pitched, voice.
He  mumbled, "Yes, I am George" and he looked in every direction trying to catch
somewhere  the fixed point he couldn't find inside himself.
"Nice to meet you", she attempted, keeping on looking the ground.
"Nice to meet you", he replied, trying to glance her face.

They  stood  there, mute, for few never ending seconds, then he asked, trying to
find  some  strength "What about drinking something?" his words were embarrassed
and awkward.
"Yes, yes, good idea" she immediately replied.

Now  he  had seen her, he had given a face to a name, a voice to an handwriting.
She  wasn't  very  attractive, actually she was quite bad looking and somehow he
was strongly disappointed by that.
They  went  to  the  nearer  bar, they sat down and embarrassed they found their
salvation in the list of cocktails.  They read it much more time than necessary,
pretending to be interested by it.

He tried with "I take this one" and attempted a smile.
She said with a very low voice "I take a coke".

He called the waiter and ordered their drinks.
He  said  again "It's nice to meet you".
She said, looking the table "It's nice to meet you too".

The  drinks  arrived  and, somehow relieved by the possibility of shifting their
attention to something which wasn't themselves, they started to drink them.

He  tried  a  comment about the weather, she said "Yes".
She told something the weather of the day before and he said "Sure".
The  drinks  were  finishing,  very  slowly,  tasted in the deepest silence.
He  called a waiter and asked the bill.When it arrived he said "I pay", "No No",
she replied immediately, "No, I have to pay", he insisted and she just added "If
you want so".

With  the  brain  completely  empty,  without  any  sensible  word that he could
pronounce,  having  forgotten  all  the  brilliant  sentences he had prepared he
almost  shouted, after having looked the watch and without having seen the hour,
"I must go now, sorry".
"There is no problem", she said.

He  was  already  standing  and repeated "I am very sorry, I have many things to
do".
"No  problem,  no  problem,  I  have  something  to do too", she replied with an
embarassed smile.

"Hope to meet you again", he said, "Yes, sure", she said, "Bye", "Bye".

He almost ran out of the bar, he ran home, confused and empty.

He  laid  down  on  the bed, he took all the letters she sent, he remembered the
strong  feelings  he had reading them, he remembered the love of those words who
had  filled his life, he touched the sheets, caressed the envelopes.
He  thought  that those letters weren't written by the same woman he had met few
minutes  before.
The  rational  part  of  his  mind  was losing the battle with its opponent.
He  looked  the letters, he touched them, he smiled comforted and turned off the
light.
