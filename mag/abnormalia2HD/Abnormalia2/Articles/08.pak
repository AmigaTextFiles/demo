JIMMY wasn't feeling well.

HE knew HE won't be living for a long time.

HE wasn't desperate, but sad.

HE was realizing the contrasting situation that has been built up in HIMSELF:

On  one  hand  HE wanted to try as many emotions as possible, HE wanted to shoot
ahead towards a redemption HE strongly wanted but didn't know how to get.

On  the other hand HIS body rebelled against the treatment undergone, just as it
seems to love this life HE refuses to live.

HIS  life  was  full  of  contradictions:  HIS smallness in the greatness of the
universe.

Too much....too less.

And now LIFE and DEATH contained in the same nature.

HE felt he was trembling.

HE didn't feel to follow HIS friends as in the good old times....

So,  JIMMY,  decided  to make this last desperate effort to end HIS life in that
place HE went thousand of times before.

HE didn't know why...

HE had never tolerated all those people making such a big noise, and for what?

Only to see the grave of one of them.

They weren't polite: it was JIMMY's house!

But  now  that  HIS  energy  and  HIS strength were going away and HIS heart was
beating for the last times, HE was feeling attracted by that grave.

The grave of a man as idolized when dead as despised when alive.

Finally HE reached the goal.

As HE laid on the tombstone HE got more and more relaxed and....

....in  a  moment  HE felt like burning, then suddenly the world started to spin
and HE was surrounded by a feeling of peace....

What  an emotion:  for the first time in HIS life HE was feeling in harmony with
the world; life was too beautiful to end....too late....and HE died.

Next  day  the  first  visitors  of municipal cemetery of Prere Lachaise found a
little  cat  dead  on  the grave of Jim Morrison; HE had a little plate with the
name "JIMMY" written on, and that was noticed by everyone.

No one noticed his expression: HE WAS HAPPY!

                   I didn't want to live: THEY made me live.
                     I didn't want to die: THEY killed me.
