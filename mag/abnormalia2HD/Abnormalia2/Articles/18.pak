Mark  Stone  was  sleeping,  leaving  his  mind  to  wave  in  the  ocean of the
unconscious, playing with it, dreaming and forgetting all the masks he had built
around and inside himself.
All  at once he felt something different, a distortion, a disturbing fluctuation
that crossed his random oneiric thoughts.
He  opened  his  eyes suddenly, he immediately realized that there was something
strange  in  his  bedroom.   He turned his face to a dark point in the darkness.
There  was  somebody  there,  a  shadow  just at the right of his bed, he saw it
standing still, feeling a pair of eyes staring at him.

Mark  Stone was sleeping.  Without any reasonable reason he woke up, he left his
bed  and  walked  towards  the  kitchen,  his head was feeling the weight of the
alcohol drunk few hours before.
He  took a glass of milk, moving in the dark rooms of his house without actually
seeing  them,  he didn't need a light for the eyes when his memory could see for
him.
He  walked  back to his bedroom, the door was closed, he didn't remember to have
closed it and he entered with a strange sensation crossing with shivers his back
bone.
He  stepped  into  his  bedroom,  there  was something wrong in it, he felt that
somebody was sleeping in his own bed.
He stopped, he stared confused the body that had invaded his own space.

A  discussion,  the  voices  frightened  and  anxious, the whispers confused and
disoriented, the thoughts completely altered and illogical.
- Who are you? What are you doing in my bedroom?
- What are YOU doing in MY bedroom?
The same voice, the same absurd thought from both the mouths.
A light was turned on.
A face staring the other face. The same face. The same.
- Who are you?
- Who are YOU?
A deep discussion.
- There must be a mistake, is it a joke?
- If it's one I hope you are going to stop it!
- It's not a joke.
- I am you and you seem me.
- I must be dreaming.
- Me too, and I don't like it.
A  vortex  of  chaotic  thoughts  flooded  in  their mind, a distorted spiral of
impossible  explanations, the strong feeling that they were thinking exactly the
same things.  The same.
Mark Stone was talking with himself.
- I am Mark Stone, you are Mark Stone, we think the same things and we feel the
  same things.  But we are two and I don't feel myself splitted up.
- One of us should be a shape, a shade.
- Or a share of Mark Stone.
- But  I  feel  myself entire, I am the whole Mark and I feel that you feel the
  same.
- What  can  we  do  now?   I am splitted in two parts, you are splitted in two
  parts,  both  halves  are  a whole, there are two Mark Stone here and they are
  both complete.
- Maybe we are dreaming.  We will wake up and we will find ourselves in the same
  unique body.
- Yes, that must be the solution, we have drunk too much this evening.
- Sure, our head still aches.
- You know, it's like I were talking with myself, I am not scared of you, I know
  what you are saying before you move your lips, I think what you are thinking.
- We can stop to talk, let's just wait and see what happens.

What they thought for the rest of their life is unknown, even to me, John Stone,
son of the same two Mark Stone.
