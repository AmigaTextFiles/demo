2                      by Zulkir Maligor of The Magic Guild


The  sky  was  chasing  the  mountains  at  the  horizon, playing with the first
twilight stars and kissing the red sun sinking into other lands.
From  the towers of his castle, King Arthur closed his eyes and breathed deeply,
scented spring air filled and refreshed his body, the peace of Nature around him
seemed  to  hug  his  soul and to leave a sweet soft feeling of quiet in his old
cells.
He  turned  his  face, wherever he glanced he could see parts of his domains, of
his vast and peaceful empire, ruled with wisdom and Magik.
Nobody  could  say  that  life  was bad or hateful in that realm, everything was
under the enlightened guide of one the most important man of the world.

King  Arthur  knew  that,  he  knew  what  was  his  importance,  which were his
responsibilities,  it  was a weight he had decided to face since his youth, when
the first signals of his forthcoming fame and glory had stepped in his life.
He was the father and the hero, the prime citizen and the king.  He was almost a
god  for  somebody  but he knew that the true reality was far from the image his
people had of him.
Only  sometimes,  when  he could contemplate alone the world and the things, his
lands  and  his  life,  only  sometimes he tried to remove the mask of the king,
which he was so used to wear to forget often the real face behind.
The  first mask to remove is the one with yourself, he used to repeat, and often
he failed to analyze and peer inside himself with the right detached eye.  Often
he  used the same blind eyes of his subjects, not remembering the real reason of
his fame and success.

He  knew what he had done and what had arrived from somebody else, he knew where
his merits could finish and where luck and other forces had done.
When  he  was  alone he could realize how the image of the brave and heroic king
was  actually  a  fake mask given to the mass, as to cheat it and convince it to
follow and obey him.
His  kingdom was based on magical forces he could hardly understand and possess.
Superior  spirits  of opposite nature had had his domains as a battle field.  At
the end some unknown gods of Cosmos had won, they could bring peace and order on
these lands and they needed a puppet to control them.

King  Arthur  was the puppet, he was given the power and the glory, overwhelming
and  superior  gods  had devised this for him, it could be the most envied life,
but it was just given by somebody else.
At  the beginning, when Merlyn told him what was his fate and what these gods or
superior  spirits had decided, he felt euphoric and proud, he didn't care of the
fact that it was all just a huge present, only the idea of being the King seemed
important for him.
Years  had passed, he had done his duty in the best way but things were changed,
the  euphoria  given by the power was passed, he was left with a kingdom to take
care of and a normal human nature to fight with.
When  he  was alone he was weak, his strength and his nobility were in his name,
what he could hinder in his soul was a private unimportant particular.
Not interesting for the masses and not suitable for a ruler.
What  King  Arthur  really was, the man, the soul, the vibes and the feelings of
the  common man, what he really was could only be a danger, a weak point for his
role in the world.
A day, when the weight of the days had already tied his back, he had talked with
Jogan, the infinitely sage guru of the Magic Guild, about this.
He  told  him  about his double nature, about the difference between the man and
the  king, about his impotency in behaving as he really wanted and doing what he
really felt.

Jogan,  with  a deep low voice, giving shape to words very slowly, as if all his
sentences were of exaggerate value, said:
"King,  you  are  what  you do and you have to do what your regal role requires.
The  meaning  of  your  life stays in the eyes of every single subject of yours,
they are made to obey you, you must rule on them in the best way you feel to do.
Only you, Merlyn and me know what are the real origins of your empire, our lives
have changed since the day we decided to obey the will of gods.
If  you  think  to have an hidden part inside you, who wants to live as a normal
man,  who  thinks  to  have the same feelings of a normal human soul, you simply
have to forget it.  It's not important for your people, for the gods and for you
too  simply  because  it's not you.  You are not Arthur, not for me, not for the
gods  not  for  every other human being on this globe, you are King Arthur.
You are what the others make of you.".

King Arthur had thought for long nights about those words of Jogan, he wanted to
refuse  them,  he wanted to feed his own individuality and personality, not just
the  mask  of  power and bravery, but a night, while the rain was pouring on his
lands  and  thunders  and lightnings were pursuing his scared people, he finally
decided that he had to be the king.
His  life  was  justified with that, impulses towards other directions were just
egoist and silly personal demands.

Only  sometimes,  when  he  could face alone the sun  sinking in the horizon and
hugging  the  mountains,  shadows  of  those  vibes  could run shyly through his
thoughts, sowing doubts and hopes whose life could last till the intervention of
the  rational  mind,  no more charmed by an enchanted sunset on the lands of The
Magic Guild.
