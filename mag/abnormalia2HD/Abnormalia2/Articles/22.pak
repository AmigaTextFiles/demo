I'm  feeling  great.   The warm air of this sweet evening of end of summer blows
softly of my face while I'm running free by my car.
I  know  it's my last chance but luck, this time, is in my hands; I can feel her
kissing  my  lips, moisten by the breeze and that makes me a little bit excited.
I  turn  on  the radio and I try to struck the channel for listening a couple of
minutes of nice techno music.
The road is empty.  No cars running; there is only a man who is walking with his
dog,  but  I'm  too  fast  to  look at his face.  Soon he's another dead vision,
forgotten  by  my  busy brain.  After a quarter of hour I'm arrived.  I park the
car  in  a  big place where there are a lot of cars, one more expensive than the
other.  I get out and I walk to the entrance.  A big sign-board remembers me I'm
in  the right place.  "CASINO".  The building is a skyscraper, not too high, not
too  short.   It  was built ten years ago but it's still very modern and you can
notice  it  by a deeper look.  All lights are turned on to draw the attention of
everyone  walking  around  there,  just like honey draws bears.  At the entrance
there  are  a  bunch  of porters, welcoming me, or better, trying to lick my ass
just  to get a couple of bucks.  Usually I don't care a fuck about them but this
evening I'm feeling great and so I give them enough to drink all night.  However
time  has  arrived.  I enter the main door and I'm, of course, in the main hall,
where  twenty green tables, full of people, are waiting for me, together with my
money.

I start to walk to the roulette table.
Nevertheless  the very moment I approach the green table all the good feelings I
had   a  moment  before  vanish,  like  snow  under  the  easter  sun.   All  my
self-control, my calmness and even my good mood are gone.  As a lightning in the
dark  I  realize  why  I'm  there.   I have to pay a huge debt.  I've got to get
500.000  dollars  before  tomorrow's  monday, otherwise I'm history.  I know for
sure  that if I'll not get the amount of dollars old Jack will kill me.  He does
not  accept  delay.   Never.  500.000 dollars or my dirty but precious life.  My
hand  is  shaking  while  I'm putting money on the table.  I've decided a couple
hours  ago  to  bet  everything  I  have  in  one  time.   I must win.  No other
solutions.   14.000 dollars on 29, my age.  I've not so much possibilities but I
need just one.  One possibility or death.  One chance or death.
The  little  ball starts to roll on the roulette.  It runs fast, and then faster
and  faster.   Then  slower,  slower and slower before stopping...  Seconds that
seem days, months, years.  Heart hard beating, or better banging.  It stops, the
little  ball, not the heart.  But when I glance at it I can't even realize which
is which.  It's 13.  I've lost and I'm lost.  But, surprisingly, I feel no pain.
I exit the Casino, its lights and its voices.

A  stroll.   It takes two minutes, maybe it takes two hours.  I don't know, I've
lost  everything I had, sense of time and I'm going to lose even my life.  I can
feel  the  breath  of those bastards sent by Old Jack on my neck.  But they will
not get me.
A  bridge.   Under  the  bridge,  a river.  A jump and I'm flying.  I've lost my
money, my life.  Hope not to lose my soul too.
Hope God will forgive me.
At least one.
