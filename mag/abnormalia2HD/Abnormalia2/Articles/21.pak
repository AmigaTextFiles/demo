The atmosphere in the Galaxy disco was mysterious and exciting.
Mark  was  there  with  his girl friend, they had danced for long, leaving their
bodies  to fade into the music, while the minds were losing their control on the
people  and the things.  They had smoked that evening, a joint with heroine.  It
was  the  first  time  he  tried  to  smoke  heroine,  he  was  told that it had
hallucinogenous effects.  He was ready to discover them.

The colors around him started to melt down in a cascade of music.  His eyes were
listening, they seemed to mix shapes and notes, in an impossible way.
He  tried to reason with the hands of logic but it was useless, the world around
him was following new rules and he was excited to prove them.

He  went  to  the toilet, to refresh his face and try to see how he was looking.
It was a strange toilet, the ceiling was black and shiny, the lights were purple
and the walls were all covered of mirrors.  He entered and he saw dozens of guys
like him walking in opposite directions.  There was not much light, his faces on
the mirrors were pulsing in pink, following the will of the lights.  He ran away
from there, he came back to the dancing floor and he took ten seconds to realize
that it was completely empty.  All the people were gone, disappeared, invisible.

He ran around for many minutes, he screamed and cried, while the music was still
bumping in his ears and the strobo lights were framing his steps.
There was nobody around and the effect of the drug seemed disappeared.
His  eyes  were seeing the disco as it was, with its lights, stairs, tables.  It
was all completely normal, if not for the total absence of people around.
He walked to the dj's room, someone had to play the music.
There  wasn't  anybody inside, he was dreaming a world where the machines didn't
need human control.  He tried to relax and think about the situation.  It was an
hallucination  for  sure, it was the heroine, he thought, and he decided to exit
from  the  disco, to breath the cold air of the town and find some relief in the
comfortable and well known smokes of the cars.

A  deep fog waited him outside.  He didn't remember such a fog few hours before.
He couldn't see more than ten meters but still there was something else that was
strange there.
In  the cold and wet air, among the deepest fog, he took some minutes to realize
that  there wasn't any rumor outside, there was no car passing on the street, no
people  walking  around.   Nothing  at  all.   It was all grey and just the city
lights could sparkle shyly around him.

He  walked  in a state of confusion for few steps, he sat down, he walked again.
Among  the fog, some metres ahead of him he saw a dark human profile.  He called
it,  he  asked what was happening, but the shape didn't reply and in few seconds
was lost again at his sight.
Mark  ran  towards  that direction, screaming and calling, but he didn't saw the
outline  again.   He stopped, he breathed and another shape appeared in the fog,
he called again but nothing happened, nobody replied.
He  saw  other forms around, other shadows, other silent human bodies sliding in
the  fog,  he always tried to run after them, to catch them and he always failed
to  reach  them, they were continuously disappearing in the fog, which was still
coloured by pale, mute lights.
He  was  in total despair now, his mind was completely lucid, his eyes could see
normally,  his ears seemed to hear only his own voice.  He started to weep, like
a  child,  without  caring any more of the shadows dancing around him and joking
with his mental health.

He  thought  about  her  girl friend, he had almost forgotten her and the Galaxy
disco, he remembered the joint and the toilet.  In the cold street, totally lost
and  in  deep  despair  he realized that it had been a bad decision to leave the
desert  disco,  it  all began there and only there he could find the solution of
his nightmare.
He tried to orientate himself, to look for a known street of the town, he walked
again,  trying  to  come  back  on his steps.  Finally he found an open bar, its
lights  seemed to blink at him, to invite him finally to the world of the living
and  moving  people.  He entered, a comfortable heat hugged his body and finally
the fog moved away from his eyes.
There  was  nobody in the bar.  There wasn't even the bar keeper, even if it was
opened and well lighted, even if the juke box was playing merrily its music.  He
walked  around,  among  the tables.  It was like in the disco, everything seemed
normal but there weren't people around.
There  was  something  else,  something  different,  he looked absent-minded the
ash-tray  on  a  table.   It was containing half a cigarette burning quietly, he
looked  the  other tables, there were other lighted cigarettes, and just at that
moment  he  realize that there was the smell of burnt sandwiches in the air.  It
was  too  much  for  his  destroyed  self-control  he ran outside the bar crying
savagely and howling like a beast.  He kept on running, without knowing where he
was  going,  diving in the wall of fog, feeling the cold air caressing his face.
He  started  to  laugh, to cry and to laugh, the world was a cage of coloured in
grey  smoke, he tried to kick and to scratch the air, to break the fog, to smash
it.  He laughed when he realized that he was condemned to be lost in the fog.
There  was nothing better, he thought, than to live centuries running in a dark,
cold,  foggy  and  dead town.  He started to sing, to jump, to hop around, while
cold, mad, tears were crossing his face and his logic mind was completely losing
the battle with reality.

After hours of frantic run he collapsed to the ground, exhausted, dismayed.
He  lied  on  the ground for minutes, or hours, or days, he couldn't realize how
much.   When  he  opened his eyes he saw the Galaxy neon just above him.  He had
find  the  way  back  to the disco and he thought, breathing in relief, that the
salvation was near.  He entered and he saw with total joy that there were person
around!  Living persons, talking, breathing, pushing themselves!
He almost fell down laughing, the world of the men had came back.
He  run  inside,  his  heart  rejoiced seeing hundreds of people dancing, moving
themselves, feeling good, right, normal.
He  was  sweaty  and  his dresses were dirty and ruined, he decided to go to the
bathroom  to clean up himself.  He entered and he smiled again, there was just a
mirror  and the lights were white and strong, it was a normal toilet of a normal
disco  of  a  good  old  normal town of the planet Earth he knew and he loved so
much, especially after the few previous hours.

When  he  left  the toilet he looked for his girl friend, he thought that he had
something  to  explain  to her, he was sure that she could understand, after all
she  had smoked that joint too, she could understand his terrible nightmare, his
bad trip.
He  walked  among  the  people, smiling and feeling other bodies pushing his own
one, he continued to walk, to search and to like the contact of other bodies for
an  hour, then he started to be annoyed, he was sure that his girl friend wasn't
in  the disco any more.  He thought that she had gone back home before, while he
was lost in the fog and he relaxed again, unaware of the fact that the following
days  of his life had to be a desperate and hopeless search for his girl friend,
of which were lost every trace on the world of the breathing humans.
She wandered forever in a world of mental shadows, lost in the fog.
He never saw her any more, after the night at the Galaxy disco.
