Marco, kneeling on the edge of his bed, let his eyes wander in the wall in front
of  him  and  delay  upon  the  usual  things.   Every  night, in the long hours
preceding  the  longed  for  sleep,  he observed the multicoloured covers of the
books  in  the  shelf, as he wanted to impress some components of the reality in
his confused mind.
He  saw the white binding of a history of literature, at the side of some french
poems  collections and Poe's and Lovecraft's tales.  Near these, almost a homage
to  the  authors  habits,  a little collection of bottles.  Among these, Marco's
liking  went  to  an  irish whiskey, cause it often helped him to overcome those
nights that the freakish dawn seemed to avoid.
Even  posters,  for  their  own nature merry, were adverse and cold, indifferent
witnesses of the watching boy.
In  fact,  if  we  exclude  eyes  that,  first  slowly, then more and more fast,
reconnoitered  the  room, Marco was immobile as the objects around him.  But his
stillness  was  only  a  superficial thing:  in his mind the present images were
deranged and alternated with flash-backs of a recent and remote past.
Visions  of  the just spent day mixed with the preceding ones, that had the same
clearness,  not  for the neatness of the older memories, but for the haziness of
the nearer ones.
So  Marco,  overwhelmed  by  chaotic thoughts, tried desperately to cling to the
only thing his senses gave as real:  the present.
Day  after  day  he  lived  in  the  fear  of  the evening and night after night
everything became more confused.
But  it  hadn't always been like this.  Even in the darkness of his ideas, Marco
knew  that  his  drama  began  when he came back from a journey, but remembering
where was a too big claim for his failing psyche.
However  he  was  conscious  of having come home a day and since then everything
looked like in a dream.
To  tell  the  truth, he dreamed a lot, at least the few times he slept, and his
dreams  seemed to have the same consistence of the reality.  Or maybe it was the
contrary,  his  life was losing more and more meaning till when it became only a
diurnal oneiric activity.
Everything was veiled by the coating of time in the same moment it happened, and
so unchangeable, passed.
Sometimes  he  tried  to  rebuild  his  day,  but  he  could  remember  only few
particulars, as instead of hours, years passed.
So he decided to write, night after night, those events, at least, that let some
traces and he realized that they couldn't have been happened in near days.
And  a night, finally, he understood.  That day he went to buy the tickets for a
trip he liked to do for a long time, a journey from whom he'd never come back.
Many  people  say  that  before  dying  everyone  sees  his life like in a film,
perhaps,  you  don't  run  over  your whole life again, but only some moments of
particular relief like in a summing up.
