   2                         by The Ripper/Nightfall


The  shattering  of  a  mirror,  the  missing  of  a certainty, an illusion that
disappears.

Dramatic images that rise an immediate feeling of fear, if not of pain.
Pain  and  illusion,  illusion  and  pain  are  very  often used together in our
literary and philosophical culture.
If, sometimes the first one, pain, is missing, it's because it exists the second
one,  illusion;  and  when  the  illusion is missing pain comes, deeper and more
violent.
So we can say that these illusions are indispensable for us.
They are foolish, brittle, but without them we can not live.
Life  itself  is  pain,  man, however, have in the deepest part of his soul, the
ability  of  building,  around  him,  some  "Myths" such as immortality, love or
beauty, myths for which, altough their illusive value, it's worth to be alive.

The  saga  of  the  human  being  is  ruled by these universal values bearing up
against the destructions made by time and nature.
Nevertheless  they  do not bring man to happiness but they give him the sense of
his dignity and the height of his love.

Looking  at  them  from  another  point  of view we could say that illusions and
dreams  are features of an old and totally dead world, where primitive men could
believe in those dreams, completely driven by their basic instincts and, because
of that, happy.
Year after year, human race, following the sunny Reason, the mind, always asking
and  seeking  for something, is selfish and greedy, believing in nothing but his
ego, in a world parched by science and tecnology.
It's science itself, claiming to build a better world, that make men unhappy.
It's  like a god, always asking for sacrificies, and the victims are always men,
spending their life for it!
Men deceived of being something, without realizing of being only dust.

These  are  some  thoughts of mine I tried to write after a rather deep study of
philosophy  and  literature so, as you probably have already noticed, it's not a
very  original  text.   But it's something that I feel heartly and I agree with,
even if maybe not completely.
Maybe  happiness  or  what  we  desperately are seeking is not only an illusion,
maybe it's a real feeling.  Maybe not.
Maybe what I've written does not mean anything to anyone but me.
Or maybe it does not mean anything for me too.
Who knows? Maybe God, or maybe not.
