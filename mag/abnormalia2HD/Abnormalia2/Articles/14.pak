It was night.
James was driving in the fog.
He  had  to  reach his friends in a sort of castle where he had to pass the last
night of the year.
The  31th  of December is a different day.  It passes in the preparations of the
night, it reaches its meaning in its last hours.
Day of balances and of projects. Day of hopes and aspirations.
The party was to be a huge and interesting one.
There  were  more than 400 persons, that was sure.  The place was an old castle,
completely rebuilt and quite mysterious.
A weird place to pass the longest night of the year.
He  was  quite excited about that, the fact that it was distant didn't touch his
expectations  for  the  party.   There  was  also  Maria and he had something to
conclude with her.
He turned on the radio.  The night had already hugged the world and those sounds
from the world of the livings could give him something different to think about.
During the trip,  driving slow and carefully, he slowly lost his good mood.
The atmosphere was depressing and somehow menacing.
He hated the fog, he hated to drive in the fog.
He  couldn't  stand the idea that twenty metres on front of him there was just a
grey wall.
It was something that made him feel not at ease.
He knew the way, anyway, more or less.
He just had to take care of the signs just out of the highway.

"Take  the  right  direction  and  then  go straight on", he was told and he was
always  repeating those words in his mind without interruptions as to forget the
sensation of being lost in the fog that slowly was entering in his brain.
He  had left the highway, its comfortable lights had stopped to show him a piece
of  road.   He  was  finding himself driving terribly slowly, following with the
anxious eyes the lines on the road.
He started to be worried, the hour was late, he couldn't lose a single minute of
the party.
He tried to drive faster.
The car was running in the fog, it could be dangerous, he thought, but I have to
risk.

Suddenly  he  saw  a dark figure on the road, it was too late to avoid it and he
bumped on it.
"A stupid animal", he thought without stopping, he was already late.
The  little  accident  anyway had convinced him to drive slower, to avoid to cut
the fog too fast.
The radio signal was very disturbed, he decided to turn it off.
Silence came down on his existence and he immediately felt a cold shiver running
on  his  back.  He tried to turn on the radio, he couldn't just think to keep on
driving without some noise to fill his mind.
He  switched  it on but nothing happened, there were just some buzzes far from a
single clear signal.
He  tried to song something, to break the unsustainable cage of silence that was
grasping  his mind.  He soon stopped, like a flash in the night he thought again
at the accident of few minutes before.
A  strange  and absurd thought came to his mind.  It was not an animal, it was a
human  being, he had run over a man!  He started to sweat, panic was entering in
his body.
The  road was still an unknown stripe in front of him, the darkness was complete
and the lights of his car were just enough to follow the street.
He  couldn't  remember how long he was driving, time had lost any sense for him,
they could be hours, days or years, his life seemed passed in the grey, cold and
anonymous fog that seemed to have grasped the world forever.
The  thought of having killed a man was striking his mind without interruptions,
he  couldn't bear the idea and he started to cry, completely caught by panic and
by the sure sensation of being lost in the fog.
He stopped his car, there was no need to go on, the way was unknown to him.
He stepped off and took a deep breath, shivering in the chill of the last day of
the year.
He  decided  to  have a short walk around, just to refresh his mind, even if the
icy atmosphere was even worse for his destroyed nerves.  While he was walking on
the  street  thinking  again about the shape he had bumped into which could be a
man  who now could need help he saw a pair of lights coming towards him, cutting
the  grey  barrier  of condensed air.  He breathed in relief, there was somebody
who  could  help  him,  a sign of life in that desert of the unseen was the best
thing he could hope.
He  started to move his arms, he shouted and he run towards the approaching car,
which was running quite fast.  Too fast.
Too  late  he realized that his shape could hardly be seen by the car driver, he
saw the lights getting bigger and bigger and the metallic monster coming on him.
He  screamed  frightened  but it was too late, the car bumped on his legs and he
was driven out of the track.
He fainted and when he woke up a terrible pain grabbed his body from the legs to
the brain.
He looked around, there was only fog.
He  started  to  tremble,  he  shouted desperate but he already knew that it was
useless.   He  was  there,  at the side of the road, laying in the snow with the
legs crumbled and the dresses wet and frozen.
For  a while he thought about the shape he run over and the new year's party, he
thought  about  Maria  and  the streets of fog he had crossed for minutes longer
than years.
The howl of a wolf lost in the fog accompanied the last seconds of his life.
