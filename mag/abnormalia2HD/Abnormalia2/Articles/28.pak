Etruscans  were  the main tribe in Italy before the rise of the Roman empire and
they  had  a great affect on the Roman culture.  When we think about the Romans,
we  remember  the  togas,  the  triumphs,  the  gladiators,  the  vaults and the
surnames...   I  am  sorry  to disappoint anybody, but all of these are Etruscan
inventions!

After  1st Etruscan tombs were found in 17th century, the historians have argued
the  origin  of Etruscans.  2000 years ago they were almost unanimous; Dionysius
of  Halicarnassus  (1st  century B.C.) was an only ancient historian who claimed
(with  political  reasons?)  Etruscans were the indigenous people of Italy.  All
the other historians thought Etruscans came from Asia Minor.  According to Greek
historian Herodotus (ca.  485-425 B.C.) Etruscans left Lydia (an ancient country
in  Asia  Minor),  because  there  was a bad famine.  According to another Greek
historian Thucydides (ca.  455-400 B.C.) some Etruscans still lived in Limnos (a
Greek  island close by the coast of Asia Minor) before Athenians conquered it in
510  B.C.   This  is  a  very  interesting  piece of information, because modern
archaeologists  have  found  Etruscan  texts in Limnos which were written in 6th
century  B.C.   However,  it  is  quite  strange how little the myths of ancient
Greece  and  Rome  deal  with  Etruscans  and their migration from Asia Minor to
Etruria.   Much  more  the  myths  handle  Aeneas and his migration from Troy to
Latium.  Well, later Latins succeeded little better than Etruscans...

The  political  situation  in Europe and Middle East changed totally in 13th and
12th  century B.C.  At that time so-called Sea Peoples migrated on the coasts of
the  Meditteranean Sea like Vikings a couple of millenniums later.  The names of
the Sea Peoples were strange:  Lukka, Denyen, Peleset, Meshwesh, Ekwesh, Tjeker,
Weshesh,  Skekelesh,  Shardana  and  Teresh.   Three  last  tribes  are the most
interesting ones, because they arrived later in Italy and named their countries:
Skekelesh,  Shardana  and Teresh became Sicilians, Sardinians and Tyrsenians (or
Tyrrhenians, that is the Greek name of Etruscans)!

On  one  the  hand  nobody really knows the origin of Etruscans but on the other
hand many etruscologists think it is irrelevant knowledge.  The Etruscan culture
was  not  very  remarkable  when  they  arrived  in  Italy before 1000 B.C.  The
Etruscan  area in Italy was between the rivers Tiber and Arno.  There were their
greatest  cities  Tarquinia, Caere, Veii, Vulci, Vetulonia, Populonia, Arretium,
Clusium  and  Volterra.   The  cities  were  very autonomous and they had only a
religious  center:   Volsinii.   Very fast development of Etruscan culture began
when  Greeks  started  to  found the colonies in South Italy in 757 B.C.  In the
beginning  their  friendship was very useful for both:  Etruscans gave metals to
Greeks  and Greeks gave luxuries to Etruscans.  Greeks also taught Etruscans how
to  write.   Later  their  relationship  worsened,  because  both  had their own
commercial  interests.  Besides Etruscans allied with Carthaginians who were the
bitter  enemies  of  Greeks.   But  the  biggest  bone  of  contention was their
expansions.   Not  only  Toscana belonged to the Etruscan empire in 6th century,
but also Emilia-Romagna, Umbria, Lazio, Campania and Corsica.  When Greeks tried
to  conquer  the  last-mentioned  island, Etruscans won Greeks completely in 535
B.C.   At  that  time  Greeks  gave the name 'Tyrrhenian Sea' to the sea between
Italy,  Sicily,  Sardinia  and  Corsica,  because  Etruscans  ruled  that sea so
completely.

The  Etruscan  superpower  did  not last a long time.  First Romans banished the
Etruscan kings who ruled in Rome from 616 to 509 B.C.  As a result of this their
good  relationship  changed  to  the  continuous war, and Etruscans were usually
stronger.   But  then  Greeks  helped  Romans when they won Etruscans in the sea
battle  of  Cumae  in  474  B.C.   After  this  defeat Etruscans gave up.  Their
enthusiastic  art  became  fearful of death.  The Etruscan religion was strange:
they believed the lifetime of their nation would be 900 years.  Now they thought
their  time  had  come.   By  the  end  of 5th century Corsica and Campania were
conquered  by  Greeks,  Lazio  by  Romans,  Umbria  by  Umbrians  themselves and
Emilia-Romagna  by Celtics.  All this happened so easily.  When Romans conquered
their 1st major Etruscan city Veii in 406-396, the other Etruscan cities did not
help  their  compatriots.   If  all  the  Etruscan  cities had attacked together
against  Rome,  we  would  have  never  know  anything  about  the Roman empire.
Etruscans still were much stronger together than Romans.  Romans needed 10 years
to  conquer  Veii  which was only the medium-sized Etruscan city.  But Etruscans
had  really  lost their optimism.  Only once they fought together against Romans
in  the battle of Sentinum (295 B.C.), but it was too late.  Romans were already
too powerful, and they conquered the whole Etruria by 265 B.C.

Romans  respected very much the Etruscan culture.  One of 1st etruscologists was
emperor  Tiberius  Claudius  Nero  Germanicus  (10  B.C.-54  A.D.) who wrote the
Etruscan  history in 20 (!) volumes which have unfortunately disappeared (What a
loss!).  His interest in the Etruscan culture was caused by his 1st wife Plautia
Urgulanilla  who  was  Etruscan.   According  to Roman historian Gaius Suetonius
Tranquillus (70-140 A.D.) she was a very typical Etruscan woman:  beautiful, but
immoral!   Claudius also studied Etruscan language.  Most Etruscans had begun to
speak  Latin  100  years  earlier,  but  there  were still many augurs (Etruscan
diviners)  who  were  able to speak Etruscan.  Many other emperors had augurs as
advisers,  too.  The last of them was emperor Flavius Claudius Julianus Apostata
(332-363  A.D.)  whose  augurs  advised  him  not  to  attack  against Persians.
Julianus  did  not believe them, and he died in that battle.  The history is the
most  ironic:  the last pagan emperor died, because he did not believe his pagan
diviners...
