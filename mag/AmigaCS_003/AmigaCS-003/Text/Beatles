                                      Yesterday,
                       All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
                            Now my database has gone away.
                              Oh I believe in yesterday.

                                      Suddenly,
                     There's not half the files there used to be,
                               And there's a milestone
                                   hanging over me
                           The system crashed so suddenly.

                               I pushed something wrong
                             What it was I could not say.

                                Now all my data's gone
                          and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

                                      Yesterday,
                      The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
                         I knew my data was all here to stay,
                             Now I believe in yesterday.

                       When I find my code in tons of trouble,
                          Friends and colleagues come to me,
                              Speaking words of wisdom:
                                    "Write in C."

                           As the deadline fast approaches,
                           And bugs are all that I can see,
                             Somewhere, someone whispers:
                                    "Write in C."

                               Write in C, Write in C,
                             Write in C, oh, Write in C.
                               LOGO's dead and buried,
                                     Write in C.

                          I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
                          For science it worked flawlessly.
                              Try using it for graphics!
                                     Write in C.

                        If you've just spent nearly 30 hours,
                               Debugging some assembly,
                               Soon you will be glad to
                                     Write in C.

                               Write in C, Write in C,
                            Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
                               BASIC's not the answer.
                                     Write in C.

                                Write in C, Write in C
                             Write in C, oh, Write in C.
                              Pascal won't quite cut it.
                                     Write in C.
