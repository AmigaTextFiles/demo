@{c 6EFFCB}1. Novice-Question : How do I recognize Windows ?@{c}

  If  your  screen  is  invaded  by  countless  silly  little  icons no one is able to
understand,  if  your  computers  speed is reduced to almost zero, if your harddisk is
full,  if  you can't start your normal programs anymore, then indeed you have made the
fatal mistake of acquiring Microsoft Windows !


@{c 6EFFCB}2. Virgin-Questions : What exactly is Windows ? Why do I need Windows ?@{c}

  Windows  is  a  form of modern warfare.  It's yet another attempt of the electronics
industry to rape and destroy the minds of its unsuspecting victims.  And of course you
don't  need  Windows.   It needs you.  Bill Gates needs you to buy it to get even more
rich  and  hateful.   Rumours  that  the  Windows  project  was originally launched by
psychiatrists  to  provide  them  with a constant source of new patients have not been
confirmed yet.


@{c 6EFFCB}3. McAfee-Question: Is Windows a virus ?@{c}

  No, Windows is not a virus. Here's what viruses do:

 1) They replicate quickly - okay, Windows does that.
 2) Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system
    as they do so - okay, Windows does that.
 3) Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk - okay,
    Windows does that too.
 4) Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with
    valuable programs and systems.  Sigh... Windows does that, too.
 5) Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is
    too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware.  Yup, that's
    with Windows, too.

  Until now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences:

  Viruses  are  well  supported  by  their authors, are running on most systems, their
program code is fast, compact and efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated
as they mature.  So Windows is not a virus.  It's a BUG!


@{c 6EFFCB}4. Lamer-Question : Are there any cheats for Windows ?@{c}

  Repeated  pressing  of  ALT-F4  RETURN is said to enhance the quality of the working
atmosphere.   The  same  effect  can  be achieved by pressing the reset button.


@{c 6EFFCB}5. Critics-Question : Why is Windows as bad as it is ?@{c}

  If  Windows  were  bug-free, fast, easy-to-use, compatible, openly structured, cheap
and  efficient, in other words if Windows were a good operating system, there would be
no  need  for Microsofts daily updates (also called bug-changes) with which they trick
the  money  out  of  their  customers pockets into their own.  Also, such an operating
system would not come from Microsoft, it would come from real programmers.

@{c 6EFFCB}6. Nintendo-Mutant-Question : Is Windows a game ? Do I need a joystick ?@{c}

  Yes,  Windows  is  a  game!  It has all the characteristics of a game:  It has color
graphics, sound, there is movement on the screen and the user has to press keys or use
the  mouse  to play it.  It's difficult to solve Windows or even Windows NT, but there
are  quick-guides  or, for the inexperienced, complete step-by-step walk-throughs (see
also  Lamer-Question).   There  is  no  need  for  a joystick as Windows supports both
keyboard, mouse and telepathy (think of a system crash and you get one).


@{c 6EFFCB}7. Programmer-Question : Are there any standards for Windows programming ?@{c}

  Of  course  there are.  More than you can count.  In fact, the wonderful thing about
Windows  programming  specifications is that there are so many you can choose from and
that  they  change  from  version  to  version.   Not to forget the fact that no other
program  running  under  Windows makes use of them.  All in all there's only one thing
you need to know:  Real Programmers don't use Windows.

@{c 6EFFCB}8. Sceptics-Question : Is this text making any sense at all ?@{c}

  As  this  text is about Windows, it cannot have any sense.  It's a stupid text about
a stupid  would-be-program.   It's  kept  close to the characteristics of its subject:
It's funny, senseless, useless, and time and space consuming.


@{c 6EFFCB}9. Version-Question : What's the newest version of Windows ?@{c}

  "Kairo"  and "Chicago" are out of date.  After first test runs, Microsoft decided to
rename  their  projects to the more appropiate titles "Titanic" and "Hindenburg".  The
alternative  set  of names "Challenger" and "Tschernobyl" has been discarded.  Rumours
of  other  project  names  like "L.A.", "New York", "Irkutsk", "Chongqing", "Uppsala",
"Claudia Schiffer", "Micky Maus", "Buy Me", "Schoppe" or "Extended Error 17" have been
discarded.


@{c 6EFFCB}10. Utility-Question : Is there a tool that takes care of Windows ?@{c}

  Yes!   Look  out  for the new V4.2 release of KillWin, available at all well stocked
computer stores and mailboxes.  KillWin V4.2 features auto-detection of Windows on all
drives  and  four  modes of operation combined with optional full purging and packing.
Average savings of hard disk space exceed more than 20 MByte, average working speed is
increased dramatically and user happiness is made possible.


@{c 6EFFCB}11. Defender-Question : How can I protect my system against Windows ?@{c}

  The  easiest  way  is to make McAfee's Scan recognize it.  To do this, create a file
(e.g.  "winvirus.txt") with the following content :

  #The two-faced sinister Windows Virus
  "e87928bbf6048be3", Microsoft (R) Windows

  (Don't forget the return at the end of the last line !)

  To check your programs for viruses, start Scan like this :

  SCAN /EXT WINVIRUS.TXT

  Note  that  if  the file is not in the current directory, the full path name must be
specified, e.g.  scan /ext j:\dos\tools\virus\scan\ext\winvirus.txt



@{c 6EFFCB}99. Bill Gates-Question : Are you nuts ?@{c}

  Yes of course, Windows made us so.
