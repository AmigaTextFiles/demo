                    Notes for RTG users
                    ===================

Devotion  is  optimized for a  640x256  display,  and looks
slightly  strange in  other modes.  It has been tested on a
Cybervision 64/3D under Picasso96.  If you want to create a
640x256 mode for your Picasso96 based display, it is really
very easy.

It should  also be possible to create such a mode for CGFX,
but as I don't use it,  the details  are not  included here
(anyone?)

Although devotion will work happily with either AGA or RTG,
on slower CPUs it is a lot faster to use AGA. On my 030/25,
page rendering is noticeably much faster under AGA.  An 040
or 060 should in theory be able to make up for this, as the
speed loss is the CPU doing the work of the blitter.

Note  that  the  taller  the screen is, the slower devotion
will be.  1280x1024 is painfully slow on the 030/25, but it
all looks too small anyway :)

         How to go about creating a 640x256 mode
         =======================================

1. Load up Picasso96Mode
2. Make sure the correct GFX card is highlighted
3. Click on the "New Item" icon,  and drag&drop it over the
   resolutions (it should say "New Resolution")
4. Go to the width and height boxes and change it to  640 x
   256. Give it a new name if you like.
5. Click on the  "New Item" icon, and drag&drop it over the
   modes  (it should say "New ModeInfo")
6. Click on  "Edit" and use the  cursors to centralize  the
   new mode (use your monitor controls also)
7. If the mode is  flickery, try upping the clock speed. If
   the screen goes black and/or your monitor emits  a  high
   pitched  whine, PRESS ESC IMMEDIATELY!
8. Click Save, then reboot
9. Configure devotion to use your new mode

Easy huh?
