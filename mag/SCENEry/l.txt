  "Generation #6" says it's just a rumour. And, just to make confusion
  total, "R.A.W #5" claims Easy-E left the scene :) Another source said
  Easy-E had joined Taurus, which is probably true, since I have him
  confirmed in Taurus running a board called 'TATOOINE'.

Lego is a mainly German demo group of some notoriety, who were born in 1993
and released their first production - the humourours but uninventive "The
Real 40k" [12/93] at The Party that same year. They followed this up with
the strong slideshow "Never Liked Uno" [04/94] in april of the following
year, and suddenly their name was on everyone's lips! In addition to his
activities as a coder, Raw Style is also webmaster of the official Mekka
Symposium website (http://ms.demo.org).
  1994 - German musician Chromag joined from DCS in may. German graphician
Fade One (ex Masque, 05/94) left for Essence.

  The Real 40k (1993, 27.12, ECS 40k Intro).

· Never Liked Uno (1994, .05, ECS Multifile Slideshow).
  code: Bailey, Twice (installer), gfx: Fade One, Sire (icons), music:
  Twilight and Doc Holiday.
  review: What can I say? Fade One's slideshow is amazing, that's all there
  is to it. What amazes me the most, I guess, is the way he is able to make
  amazingly colorful pictures with only 32 colors; it seems like a lot
  more. My favorite picture has to be the first one, of a woman in a lake.
  That's one of my alltime favorite pictures...and his logos are always
  great - need I go further than mention his Razor logo? The music is good
  too, a very easy-listening tune. This one's right up there with "Seven
  Seas" and "Artcore". The release date is based on the one in the
  installer.

  review: "Boom" opens with a familiar-looking Lego logo, before the only
  real effect; a fullscreen, fast but blocky voxelspace routine...with a
  rather large piece of LEGO added to the scenery :). Not bad at all, and
  the hip-hop chick at the end roolz, Sire!

  review: Lego are wellknown for their oldskool flavor, and this invitation
  intro will do nothing to take that tag away. It's basically a rendition
  of the classic Paranoimia cracktro most of you will know from the old
  days, with some overlaid textwriters and remixed music. Very nice idea!
  System demands are very modest; a good old A500 will do nicely.

Lemon. [old] (1993-1993)
------------------------
DEN> Capricorn (music, old handle Hobbit, ex Flash Produvtions), Flaring
     Horizon (raytrace, old handle Morten Thuesen), Pollas (code).
NOR> Blazer (Morten, code, ex Andromeda, new 07/93), Duel (ex Andromeda, new
     07/93), Moxy (swap, ex Andromeda, new 07/93), Disko (old handle Raider,
     new 07/93).

Lemon. (pronounced Lemon-point) was born when some of the best members of
the former supergroup Anarchy decided to leave and build their own group.
The group was officially formed by Facet, Dan, Nuke, Hannibal, Slash, Mad
Freak and Paradroid on the 1st of February 1993. However, they didn't last
that long as a group - they died at The Party 3. They left behind a lot of
good demos, though, and that's always something. They'll be remembered as a
group with a humorous approach to the scene, and one of the leading groups
of 1993 with several memorable releases.
  1993 - English swapper Majic Mushroom (ex Quartz) joined Fairlight late in
the year. Lemon. died at The Party 93, and here is what happened to members:
- Most of the best members joined Spaceballs; Facet (mainorg, ex Anarchy),
  SuperNao (ex Freestyle, old handle Nao), Dan (ex Anarchy), Spaceman (ex
  Anarchy, old handle Nuke), Lizard (ex Andromeda), Danny (ex Anarchy), Dope
  (ex White Label) and Kr'33 (ex Sanity) joined Spaceballs.
- English coder Paradroid (ex Anarchy) left the scene... but The Jungle #7
  claims he joined Axis!
- The two danes Hannibal (Søren Hannibal, code) and J.A.D.E (gfx, old handle
  Slash), both ex Anarchy, left the scene to work on games. They were both
  employed by Core Design, for which they released the great shoot 'em up
  game "Banshee" (with music by Spaceman!) before they moved on to work for
  Sega USA. Who says the scene won't take you anywhere!?

Danish musician Julius (ex Mad Freak/Anarchy) joined Polka Brothers.
Jason, Joachim (both ex Andromeda), Futuremind, Papillion and Dr.Gyble
  joined the new Razor 1911. LOTS of conflicting information is available
  about this, mostly probably due to the fact that they didn't all join at
  once. One source claimed danish superswapper The Pride (ex Sanity) also
  joined, though the truth is he joined Movement, and went from there to
  Razor. Futuremind was claimed to have joined Balance by one source; this
  is false.
Norwegian Chard (ex 2000 AD, new 07/93) left after a short while.

  2000 - Nah-Kolor's new mag "Devotion #1" revealed that likely, Dan, Del
and Spaceman will appear in the hollywood movie based on the game they
designed, "Tomb Raider".

· Announce (1993, 19.03, ECS File).
  code: Hannibal, gfx: Facet, J.A.D.E., music: Julius (ProPacker 1.0 format,
  2 tunes).
  review: I've always liked "Announce", especially the way the music is
  linked with the onscreen action. Coupled with outstanding graphics from
  Facet, fabulous code by Hannibal, groovy music by Julius and a humorous
  approach to the demo concept, this one's a winner. It was, as most of you
  will know, to announce (hence the name) the birth of the new group Lemon.
    To access the 'hidden part' type LEMSHIP on the credits screen at the
  beginning. Nothing will appear to have happened, but on the next screen
  there will be a small bonus travelling across the top of the screen ;).

  review: I dug this small demo when I first saw it, and I still do. The
  design is a refreshing change, and it's fun, considering what people are
  doing these days, to see the first experiments in chunky-to-planar.
  Great design and funky music is what makes this golden oldie memorable.

  review: Supposed to be released at Destiny Communion 93 (28-29.08), where
  the competitions were unfortunately cancelled, Paradroid took this home to
  finish and release it from there. The release date is therefore
  approximate. Please note that the version I review has been fixed by
  Shamrock, and that the original demo probably will not work on machines
  with AGA or accelerators.

· En Gratis Bevendien (1993, late, ECS File).
  code: Dope, gfx: Facet, music: Nao.
  review: This little intro is probably the first intro to feature recipes
  for various cookies and pastry you can make with cannabis products! Audio-
  visuals are acceptable if not outstanding.
    According to some text found when hex-reading the depacked file,
  there seems to be a hidden part that can only be accessed with a
  'slowdown' button, like the ones found on certain cartridges! This sounds
  highly improbable to me, but who knows?

Level 4 was formed as early as 1986, making them one of the very first amiga
scene groups. They were originally four members, of which JPN was the only
one that remained.
  1990 - Towards the middle of the year, they received two reinforcements
from Access, Stranger (code) and Duke (modem). Their first game, "Doveskill"
was finished towards the end of the year, for release thru Thalion, and made
by Mic (code), Whitestar (gfx) and JPN (music). The coder was reportedly
paid 10,000 DM for the game.

Lightforce was reborn in the middle of 1996, 8 years after they first
released Giana Sisters in March 1988... According to their homepage, their
first released was on the 19th of july 1996. They're seemingly based in
Germany, where their leader and most of their boards are. When I visited
the homepage at the very end of 1998, it still carried 1997 copyrights, so
it's a safe bet it hasn't been updated for a while!

Limited Edition is a demo group based in Sweden, where they were one of
three arrangers of Party Remedy 96. They must surely be the only group in
the scene with a SINGER (!) on their memberlist...
  1994 - Swedish graphician Pad joined Solitude 02/94.
  1996 - They're *NOT* dead, even though nearly the entire traderdivision
left or were kicked 04/96.
  1997 - Danish swapper Receiver (08/96) left for Instinct late 97.

Danish swapper Drac (new 04/96) joined Ambrosia.
Sysops Metz (ex Insane) and Wize (ex 2000AD) both joined Hardcore Design.
Swedes MRK (gfx), Nivek (both ex Industry), The Joker, Excel, Atheist (all 3
  ex Septic) and Pete joined Energy, then shortly after they all moved on to
  Vision. These days, MRK is back in LED as a triple-member...

· Ophir Chasma (1994, .02, ECS Intro).
  code: Donald, gfx: Skize, Adrian (font), music: Epithal (4ch MOD format).
  review: Just a small lifesign-intro, made for a party that they decided
  not to attend in the end after all. There's a LIMITED EDITION logo down
  the left side of the screen, bottom right there's a spinning vectorcube,
  and the middle is taken up by a textplotter, albeit with an original font,
  for once. The music is chippy - 'nuff said ;) The release date is an
  approximation, based on the release date of the other releases on the pack
  where I found it. For some reason, the file includes TWO modules,
  Epithal's and one by their new member (announced in this intro) Caroline
  Looen. Perhaps there's a small secret part or something? There's no text
  to indicate it though...
    This intro also announces TBM, Wize and Metz were -not- kicked, and that
  Pad left for Solitude.

· Flavour (1995, AGA File).
  code: PG, Skutt, Corruptor (additional), gfx: Skutt, Skize, music: Radix.
  review: Here's a production for the future! LED's first ever demo is a
  goodlooking ride through good, fast effects to a thumping soundtrack -
  just like ALL demos should be! Don't be so sure you would never win,
  people! Skutt's graphics are also good (as usual), with some unusual and
  cool logos. Skutt's style is almost as easy to spot as Butman's once was!
    Funnily enough, cocoder PG's name doesn't appear on the memberlist :)

  code/gfx: Skutt, Skize, Behemoth (font), music: Lord Epithal (The Player

  review: The intro opens with three logos - Limited Edition, DCS Graphics
  and Candela - before going to the main part, which is a text plotter
  with the party information. Down the left hand side of the screen is a
  very good raytraced Remedy 96 logo. The design in connection with the
  music gives this intro a very polished, professional feel. Especially the
  realistic sampled guitars of the music helps lift the atmosphere.
  The intro doesn't really credit anyone for code...

  code: PG (main), Ufo (additional), gfx: Skize, HP, Skutt, music: Doze
  (main), Elf (end). 5th in the Assembly 96 demo competition.
  review: The first thing that strikes me about this one is: lots of
  colors! They've achieved some fine, colorful effects here, not to mention
  fast ones! It seems all the effects have been honed to perfection, making
  them faster than what I've seen in most other demos. It opens with a
  fast, goodlooking tunnel to the first bars of the usual techno music.
  It's no better or worse than any other tune of its kind, I guess. Then
  we're on to a killer effect: a greatlooking shaded key. This one looks so
  great, you've got to see it to believe it. If I'm not very much mistaken
  we're talking FAST HAM routines here! Next we're shown a fullscreen
  picture by HP, which could have been a lot better... Then there's some
  bumpmapping, followed by a TRANSPARENT mapped chalice. Next are some cool
  morphing mapped objects, followed by a couple of rather wobbly 8-balls.
  I could go on, but you get the picture. With a few better musicians and
  graphics artists, these guys could do very good in the future! Let's hope
  they keep on trying, and give us a KILLER demo sometime soon.
  The potential's certainly there...
    The endscroller can be paused with the right mouse button, though it's
  not mentioned anywhere in the demo. It's accompanied by a calmer tune,
  which is a lot better than the maintune, which lacks identity.
  68030 or better processor is recommended.

  For some reason, there is substantial waiting between the parts. The demo
  appears, though cryptically, to refer to some kind of rebirth of this
  group. There is not enough information to substantiate this, though.
    They make references to a party held 02/90 as 'a while back', so
  this was probably released early 1990.

  review: Yowzers, this was truly a positive surprise! A first production
  from an unknown group rarely come up to these standards! This demo was
  written on and for 060-based machines, though it runs perfectly fine on
  any 020+ system with enough fast memory. Keeping this in mind, it's
  almost a given that it's not very fast on anything but a 060... I'm
  sorry, low-spec people, but if visuals like these are the tradeoff, then
  I'd better start considering a new machine right away! What we're given
  here may not be terribly fast on my machine, but GOD does it look GOOD!
  There's a 3d engine here that's to die for, and plenty of other cool
  stuff to look at! The endpart with the spiralling green bumpmap tunnel
  thing in the background was AWESOME. And I haven't even begun telling
  you about the music! It starts off like so many other tunes for the demos
  of today, but soon picks up an identity of itself...and a ton of groove!
  I hereby FULLY RECOMMEND this. I'm looking forward to what these guys
  will do next! With talent like this, the Amiga scene is far from dead!

  review: This intro was made just to adress some lies LKR feels other

  logo, followed by an ok designed textplotter part, and an end logo.
  The most notable thing, I suppose, is the music. It gets my vote for
  weirdest MOD of 1996, for sure. How about some MUSIC? And besides, the
  use of eLEET lettering in the intro really bugs me. Please, people?

  review: Another production in the peculiar LKR style, but I like this one
  quite a lot! I guess it's the special graphics style that give all these
  LKR productions a look all of its own. Actually, it just struck me that
  these graphics are not entirely unlike something Ra might come up with!
  The design is also nice; it looks like it was rushed but they managed to
  come up with some neat stuff anyway! The biggest asset of this invitation
  intro, though, is a great piece of music by Neurodancer. It's a kind of
  calm techno with a piano lead. Very very good!
    Please note that this review caters for the fixed version. The original

  review: This is not an intro or a demo, this is a piece of art. This

  rivals what professionals create today. It's a surrealistic masterpiece.
  Once again, Looker House proves that they are uniquely different, and not
  afraid to think in new paths.
    This intro was made to promote a new, forthcoming diskmagazine called
  "Insomnia". They are preparing the mag in cooperation with TRSI, and
  former "Suicid" editor Shade will be main editor of this new mag. It's a
  promising prospect, and if they can maintain the typical Looker House
  air of originality, it could well be that they've got a monster on their
  hands :) The accompanying text credits for music, but not a note left my
  speakers when I viewed it :( I'm basing the release date on the file
  dates of the archive, since no date appears in the intro or the text
  files that come with it.

  review: LKR are a group that tries hard to be different, and to have
  productions that bear some kind of common mark. Sometimes they succeed,
  and sometimes they don't. In "BTL" they only succeed halfway. They also
  try hard to be original, and also do so to a certain degree. The palette
  choices are certainly something that can instantly make you recognize an
  LKR release, and BTL is not different here. That's a few plus points for
  trying to be original then, as well as an effect I don't believe I've ever
  seen before, sort of like a flame bursting out from the middle of the
  screen and dying away towards the edges. Real cool that one! Overall
  though, I'm afraid there's still not enough entertainment here to make
  this an essential download. Sorry.

  Graphically, the mag looks like a cross between the standard Looker House
  offbeat abstract art design, ROM and late RAW. The mixture is not at all
  a bad one. Ofcourse, like all mags these days, this one also multitasks
  happily, making my job so much easier :)

  review: Riiiiight... Ok, what we have here is something a little
  DIFFERENT... These mad danes have made a 40k intro that's a tribute to
  the 'famous' (I certainly never heard of the guy ;) Danish scientist
  Holger Bech Nielsen. To Loonies' credit, I can say that now that I've
  seen the intro and read the quotes, I wanna know some more! The intro
  itself, mr. Bech Nielsen aside, is nothing that makes me jump up and down
  with excitement. There's a few routines, of course, but nothing really
  outstanding. It's mostly various (blocky!) chunky color routines that
  work best as backgrounds for the quotes.
    The intro itself contains no real credits, just the names of some of
  the producers flashed onscreen for a moment beside a picture of the main
  man, Holger. If I'm bored some day I'll watch the intro again and add the
  names to this entry :) Unlike the competition version, this one features
  a requester at the start that allows you to choose between Danish and
  English versions. Needs 2.5MB ram to run, according to the aminet info.

  review: After a brief spell of precalculation, this intro apparently
  starts...without showing me any visuals, though. Perhaps it's a graphics
  problem with the intro, I don't know, but I don't see shit though... I do
  get the chance to hear the tune, which is a pretty engaging techno affair.
  Sure wish I could see anything...

LSD was once an important, if often criticized, part of the English scene.
They took in a lot of members, until they were finally so bloated, the group
died. Their diskmag "Grapevine" was pretty popular in some circles, while

boards and published as articles (also the case of the last Cracker Journal
issues).

Grapevine... Graphician Watchman started working for Core Design late 92.
