  more than a small slideshow for some atmospheric graphics the team has
  created. No coder is credited.

The middle of 1993 was obviously a good year for Rage, winning two major
Swedish competitions in a row! Rage moved more and more of its operation
over to the PC during 1996, until it now finally seems like it's all moved
over. They released a PC demo at The Gatherig 97. The members who are now
active on the PC have been removed from THIS memberlist, and have had their
entries moved to the PC part of Scenery. They are: Digimatic (code, 08/93-

  Review: Not-bad little intro is perhaps the first impression, but when
  you look at it more closely, it becomes painfully apparent that this one
  adds absolutely nothing new. The effects are all based on old - and in
  some cases antique - effects without making ANY improvements, and the
  only half-way innovation you'll find is a semi-cool caleidoscope at the
  very end. Other effects you'll find here are zoomrotators, sphere
  mapping, fire particles and actually a wireframe vector line routine!
  A few OK transitions is all that saves this from the dustbin.

  Review: "Rabies" is a very good demo; perhaps the best demo the Amiga
  section of Rage ever made! It opens with a small animation sequence,
  which sets the perfect atmosphere for the rest of the demo. The demo
  itself contains fast, but small renditions of effects that were not all
  that common at the time; like phong shading. The design is good, with a
  red cyberpunk-y look and feel, spiced with some quotes along the same
  lines. The entire production looks pretty polished, and leaves you with
  a good feeling. Very nice.

  Review: This is not a bad little intro! It starts with some dots forming
  a Rage logo, from the bottom of the screen...almost like the routine in
  the ancient The Silents & Crionics classic "Hardwired" (12/91), though
  that routine was heaps better. Next we're given a plasma zoom tunnel
  thingie that's pretty cool, before we're shown a fractal zoom in 2x2
  resolution. Next there's a rather cool fire object routine in 2x2, where
  five or six small objects on fire fly around the screen...and that's it.
  An end screen with some email adresses and the homepage address, and
  we're outta there.
    No actual credits appear in the demo, just the e-mail addresses of four
  of the participants, and they're not very revealing.

Ram Jam was known for a long time for their chartmag "The Charts", which
was eventually closed down. Their next project in the same vein, years
later, was the magchart "Showtime" which saw a handful of issues released
before KaosMaster took the mag to Darkage.
  Ram Jam died in 1997 after key members of the group decided to end their
involvment with the scene. The group was disbanded, and the Swedish members
left to join Rebels (ROM9). Anyone can identify these Swedes for me?
  In addition to the above URL, http://www.algheronet.it/ramjam/ contains an
old website, not updated since august 97.

Italian coder Modem (ex X-Zone) left the group after RJ used his routines
  without crediting him in their demo "Massive Killing Capacity"! He formed
  a new group called Darkage.

  Rocketeer (ita swap) left late95. They did NOT leave the scene, as stated
  in some mags, but formed a new crew to develop games, called The Spooky
  Fellows (TSF). All this was in a newsfile I once found on aminet :)
Swedish musician Atheist, who was a Balance doublememb for a while, left to
  be in Balance only again, early96.

  Winner of the Euskal party 98 demo competition!
  review: Well, this is a first for me - a demo with a seemingly religious
  theme. Well, that's what it looks like the first time you look at it, but
  the title does seem to reveal a slightly humourours approach =) However,
  the theme is exploited to the full here, complete with imagery of Jesus
  himself. It all opens with a Ramses logo distorted onto the screen to
  weird music, then going the same way out. Next the real music kicks in, as
  well as a 3d scene engine taking us around what is seemingly the inside of
  a church, with those multi-colored imagery windows you find only there,
  and this is also where the intital credits appear. Next it zooms in and
  out of picture of a Jesus a few times, with the title of the demo
  gradually overlaid. Next is a more traditional 3d scene of pillars with a
  goblet inside and a moving lightsource. Next is a fullscreen picture by
  Zaac, of a black woman holding a heart in her hands which is seemingly
  spewing flames. Zaac won the graphics competition at this party too, but
  it is uncertain whether this is the same picture. next is a 3d scene with
  crosses, four moving lighsources and cubes with greetings on their sides.
  Then what looks like a painting from a church appears, waving, with a
  bumpmapped Ramses logo in the bottom left corner. Now for something
  original, a seemingly 'rubbered' 3d scene, the one from before with the
  crosses. It ends with yet another 3d scene, this time seemingly inside an
  enclosed room with some objects suspended in dead air. An upscroller (ugly
  font!) is the last thing you see, overlaid over the very first Ramses logo
  that appeared in the demo. Much of this demo relies on its 3d engine,
  which unfortunately is not among the very very best. It's good, but
  ultimately not fast and smooth enough at its present point to really
  impress in the jungle of amiga 3d. A good demo then, but not an
  outstanding one.

  review: Nicely designed and with an ambient soundtrack, this slideshow
  really had absolutely nada to do in a demo competition =] But it's full of
  charm, mostly thanks to the happy faces of the drunk RNO+DCS members who
  obviously had a good time while making this fun-prod. It opens with a few
  roughly demo-style visuals, nicely designed (as mentioned) first
  presenting the production, then with credits. One question: How on earth
  do you make a screen consisting of a wireframe vector object, and simple
  graphics scrolled in from the left and right move anything LESS than
  smoothly on a 50mhz 030 JPV? God heavens knows it can be done, I've seen
  it done on A500's! Hell, I've seen it done on C64's! =] Hrmpf. Well,
  anyway, the main part of this is a slideshow with no additional design,
  just pictures fading in and out. The charm comes mostly from the fact that
  these people appear to be having great amounts of fun.
    The slideshow is very system friendly, and you can flip screens with the
  normal Amiga-M method. It requires AGA or a graphics card, and at least an
  020 processor. There is no mention of the memory requirements. The
  'meeting' of the title occured in Lahti, Finland between the 23rd and 25th
  of february, at the same time as the World Championships in cross-country
  skiing was held there. Just in case you were wondering... =] This is the

R.A.W, after it went from a Spaceballs production in issue #7 to the first

  Astro/Virtual Dreams (main), Terrox, Rokdazone/Infect, Macno/Abnormalia,
  Lord Helmet/Spaceballs, Hollywood/Axis, Facet/Virtual Dreams.
  Review: A hallmark in the jagged history of R.A.W was the release of
  this issue, which meant several big changes. It was the first ever issue
  to be released without Lord Helmet as main editor, and it was also the
  first ever issue not to feature any graphics from Fairfax. Fresh blood
  brought fresh ideas, though, and Astro's articles are written like he'd
  have been doing this all his life. History would later show that the
  choice of Astro for a new editor would not be the best decision, but the
  things he does for this issue is very good. Even though this issue is
  released just three months after the last one (another small revolution!
  :-), the contents seem polished and well thought-out. It's especially
  nice to see Facet doing graphics reviews again, just as he did in the
  old days for Stolen Data. This is also the first issue where the home
  page is announced - what would later become a much larger part of RAW.
    There is apparently also an intro by Virtual Dreams for this issue, but
  it was not included in my distribution, and I have consequently not seen
  it. Some clipart in the 'group review' section is misplaced, occasionally
  ending up on top of text. To sum up: Very good, but then it always is.

Razor 1911 was born in Trondheim, Norway by four guys from the C64 scene -
Sector9 and Doctor No from Active Cracking Crew (and both original members
of the original Razor on the C64) and Lord S and Hypocrite from Raw Deal.
The group had previously existed on the C64 from 1985 to 1986.
  The first few years was mostly spent doing demos, and they eventually got
quite good at it. They were, however, always determined to enter the
cracking scene as well. Their big break came after The Accumulators split
up in late 1989, and they managed to persuade Onyx (euro crack) and Zodact
(usa supply sysop) to join them. Suddenly they had both originals and
crackers! This lead to a steady stream of releases (including a shortlived
cooperation with Classic in spring 1990) until april 1991.
  At that time the leaders of the group were getting tired of the Amiga
scene. Luckily the solution was near: a great PC cracker called Darwin
lived close by, and it was decided to close the Amiga section in favour of
a new life on the PC. Only a few members remained, releasing the infamous
"Voyage" demo as a last death twitch before the group was officially closed
down in the early days of 1992. The members that went along to the PC
section were Sector9 (nor mainorg), Doctor No (nor), Red Baron (Dag Nilsen,
nor sysop 'DIGITAL EXPRESS', new 07/90), Onyx (ex Accumulators, new late89)
and Zodact (Brian C., usa sysop 'THE CASTLE', ex Accumulators, new late89).
  Their board DIGITAL EXPRESS (opened 1990) was probably Norway's first
elite board, and is legendary on the Norwegian scene. They were also the
first Norwegian team to have an american elite board. See the entry below,
for Razor 1911 new, for the controversy concerning that.

Musician Gamma (10/91) joined Anarchy.
Mr.T (sysop, 12/91-early92) left.
Rascal (ex Alpha Flight) got kicked.
English coder Paradroid joined Digital.
German sysop Guru Josh (Guido, 'TECH', ex Storm) decided to leave the amiga
  scene after severe disagreements with Zodact. He eventually went back to
  where he came from; the c64 scene!
Norwegians Shine (gfx) and Lord Strangelove (Michael Karlsson, founder
  code crack) left the scene.
Swedish coder Colorbird (ex Shike/Supplex) was kicked, and therefore left
  to join Noxious (SLH11).
Psimon and Shocker joined Compact Inc. late 92.
Frequenz (sysop, ex Amaze, new RAW3), together with Badcat and Edison, got
  arrested by the Police when they were at Fornebu, Oslo in order to

  Review: Voyage is one of the greatest demos of all time, bar none. There
  are so many little touches and design things here that makes it a thing
  of beauty. Not to mention the revolutionary code! Mind you, this was the
  end of 1991, and Sim was doing some quite outrageous things here, with
  the texture mapping and stuff. He was truly a coder before his time.
  The music is also worth its weight in gold. These two tunes are half the
  demo for me, I must confess. I personally believe that the middle, calmer
  section of Overload (heard during the bubble part) is some of the best
  music Mantronix and Tip ever made. So totally recommended it hurts.
    This demo *DOES NOT WORK* on AGA machines. Fortunately, we in the Amiga
  community are blessed with some skilled coders who have taken it upon
  themselves to fix some older demos so that we can see them on our
  machines and run them from our harddrives :) Galahad is one such person.

     08/94), Subra (ex Equinox).

The new Razor 1911 was the source of some controversy when it was formed by
Colorbird/Illusion, Lizardking and Tony/The Silents and Odoen/Phenomena in
late 1993. Their only claim to the name of the old heroes was that
Colorbird was once a member... The real Razor had moved to the PC, and
wanted the Amiga side to die with their passing. Still, the debate toned
down after a while. Famous musician Lizardking is also a member of Triton
Technologies on PC, and has released several CD's. Swedish graphician PGL
was never a member, this was a misunderstanding.
  Propaganda #5 was supposed to be released at the Virtual Conspiracy
party, with new code by Hammer. Due to several circumstances, including a
hard disk crash that took parts of the code to hell, the issue was never
released and issue #4 became the final one ever released. Some of the
articles to be released in the mag were donated by Diesel8 to other mags,
like RAW, ROM and Upstream.

Young swedish graphician Tony (ex The Silents, new 12/93), one of the
  founders of the new Razor 1911, made his last scene graphics in "Memorial
  Songs 2" (01/95). He was subsequently appointed to a fulltime position
  making graphics for Team 17 in the UK.
Swedish coder and editor of 'Propaganda', Colorbird (Johan Andersson,
  03/94-12/94) was kicked between 04 and 05/95 (RAW8). The rest of the
  group felt he was becoming increasingly intolerable and arrogant after he
  moved to Oslo to start working for FunCom 04/95. He was one of the
  founders of the new Razor 1911. Diesel8 is the new main organizer.
Slash was allowed to join as a swapper after most of the danish division
  left, taking two swappers with them (Roscoe and Condor). However, three
  weeks later The Pride was recruited, and they no longer needed Slash, so
  he was kicked (PRP4).
Danish swapper Roscoe (ex Equinox) left in mid 94, and joined Bomb! in
  late 94.
Danes Chorus (music), Sid (music) and Condor (swap, all ex Majic 12, 12/93)
  joined Jewels mid 94. Chorus and Sid made the great soundtrack to the "We
  Shave Ass" (03/94) demo!
Finnish swapper and trader John Peel (ex Angels new) joined Desire (PRP4).
Swedish supposed coder Boki joined 02/94, and was kicked 04/94 because he
  was found to be a liar. He claimed he was working on a great demo, but in
  reality hadn't made anything at all (PRP4).
Swedish coder Calypso (03/94) was kicked 05/94, since he promised to start
  coding "Memorial Songs 2", but never did. It was eventually coded by
  Psionic instead.
Swedish coder Exidor (ex Infect or Medicine...) joined 04/94, but
  unfortunately left the scene soon after (PRP4).
Norwegian duo Jason (music) and Joachim (gfx) (both ex Lemon., new WHN1)
  were kicked because of too little contact with the rest of the group
  after a relatively short while, in the early part of 1994 (PRP4).
Fazer (03/94), sysop 'FLATLINE' left due to a harddisk crash. An official
  newsfile on the Propaganda disk said he joined Delight with his board,
  while inside the mag itself, it said he joined Millennium. Since the news
  in the text file seemed a little more up to date than the stuff in the
  mag, I choose to believe the file.
The danish ex-Lemon.'ers Futuremind (code), Papillion (code) and Dr.Gyble
  (trace) (all new PRP4^WHN1) were kicked mid 94.

· We Shave Ass (1994, 05.03, ECS 1MB File).
  Code: Colorbird, Hammer, Odeon, Gfx: Diesel, Tony (picture), Music:
  "Killing Floor2.1" by Chorus & Sid (main), "Dawning" by Deelite (end).
  Review: Tempo is the keyword for this demo. The uptempo rock'n'roll tune
  fits perfectly with the mood of the demo, which consistently throws some
  new effect at you. The audio-visuals are great here, with Diesel's
  graphics a highlight. Tony's graphical contribution is just one picture
  of a big, smiling face. The code is another matter though. It doesn't
  totally suck, it just fails to really come alive. There aren't any real
  'wow' effects here, so to speak. Still, the coders are the ones that have
  put the graphics and music together into such an enjoyable package, I
  guess I can forgive that. Not bad at all.
    To access the hidden part, hold down the 'l'eft mouse button before the
  'l' starts rotating in the beginning. The demo requires 1MB total memory.
  The text file mentions it may not work on 2.0 machines with only 1mb, but
  it worked fine on my A500 setup, provided I ran the add21k program prior
  to the demo.

  Code: Colorbird, Gfx: Danny/Spaceballs (title), Diesel (font), Music:

  Review: Though not much of a 'demo', I guess this animation is perhaps
  worth getting for the music. You see, all that this small production
  encompasses is a big, B&W raytraced animation of a cityscape and a boat
  in the water outside of the city. So we travel around and around these
  skyscrapers, endlessly... and that's it. I think they could have done
  without this kind of 'demo' really. Still, the music's not bad.

  Code: Odeon, Hammer, Gfx: Diesel, Music: "No Limitations" by Deelite.
  7th in The Gathering 94 40k intro competition.
  Review: Short but sweet, Chaosmaze takes a new approach to the Doom
  routine with some shading instead of real pixeled textures. The shading
  looks VERY similar to what Skull/Virtual Dreams did for his trackmo
  "242"...and this intro contains (in the file) the text 'Tanks for the
  enlightining Dr Skull' (yep, that _IS_ misspelt like that!). I guess
  this was certainly impressive back in 1994.

  Code: Colorbird, Hammer, Gfx: Danny/Spaceballs (loadpicture), Diesel
  (panel), Music: Deelite, Editors: Colorbird, Diesel.
  Review: No intro this time, so it's straight into the mag. The loader
  picture by Danny is a green, topless nymph seen from the side, with
  letters forming the word PROPAGANDA down the left side. The mag has been
  totally recoded since issue #3, and the new code sports a UNIQUE feature
  - a sort of limited hypertext clone, where you click your way to the
  article you want! Unfortunately, not enough is made of this feature,
  which could have been a killer.
    Design is the point where Propaganda fails most miserably. There's not
  really any one thing to put your finger on, it's more the FEEL the thing
  gives you. Not adequate, it says. Also, most performances here are below
  par, from the dreadful panel graphics to Deelite's music. Sorry.
  This was to be the last ever issue of Propaganda. It multitasks, though
  in an unstandard sort of way. Mind you, I'm writing this with the mag in
  the background!

  Review: A very good, polished 40k intro is this. The music is a funky
  little thing that sounds everything but chippy. There are also a few very
  nice routines here, with some texturemapping and a very nice effect with
  LOTS of dotballs bouncing around. Very very nice.

  Code: Psionic, Gfx: D-Design, Music: "Shivan Dragon" by Lizardking
  (Tracker Packer 3 format). 16th in The Party 4 40k intro competition.
  Review: Early attempts at shading here, with a not-too-good-looking 4x4
  routine with spacecutting. It's used twice, once for spacecytting three
  objects and once for showing a revolving face - that looks quite comical.
  There's also two (blocky!) pictures by D-Design...and that's it.
  It's small, not particularly sweet, and very forgettable. AGA?
    Please note that there are two versions in circulation, crunched with
  different crunchers (StoneCracker and PowerPacker, I believe). This had
  me mightily confused, since the filesizes were different. However, de-

  Review: A 'one-routine-intro', this small prod showcases Colorbird's
  blocky 4x4 doom routine without ceilings or floors. It's an early attempt
  at doom, but I can't see this impressing anyone, even back then. The Doom
  part can be paused with the RMB, but the upscroller that ends it can't...

· Memorial Songs II (1995, .01, AGA Multifile Musicdisk, 2 disks).
  code: Psionic, gfx: Tony, Diesel(8) (additional), music: Lizardking.
  review: This musicdisk is a gift for the eyes, with LOTS of great
  graphics by Tony and Diesel. There's pictures everywhere! Lizardking's
  music can't be faulted, and the coding does its job reasonably well.
  Another good thing about this disk is the fact that it's fully
  multitasking, so you can flip screens with Amiga-M just like with any
  other program. I love being able to write a review while having the
  thing in the background! This is wholly recommended.
    The tunes on this musicdisk are: Memorial Theme, Longstabben, Weird
  Personalities (also in R.O.M #1), Orhtanc (also in Oepir Risti #2),
  Sunshine Dance, Physiology Theme, My Little Oliphant, Thematic Hymn,
  Magic Nights (3rd at TP93), Compulsion To Obey (winner Assembly 94!),
  and Water Below (also in Upstream #8). There are also two additional
  hidden tunes accessed by clicking certain parts of the panel. One button
  is at the top right of the panel, and the other is below the addresses
  button, at the very bottom. The disk can be run straight off the harddisk
  with no assigns, or from floppy if so is desired. The original MEMORIAL
  SONGS was released in 1993, when Lizardking was a member of Alcatraz.
    I'm guessing at the release date; it's based on them calling it a
  delayed christmas present in one of the scrollers. This was probably
  Tony's final scene appearance, since he was employed at Team 17, making
  graphics for games.

· Dalahorse (1995, 08.10, AGA 2MB Multifile, 4 disks).
  Code: Hammer, Psionic, Gfx: D-Design, Diesel8, Music: Lizardking &
  D-Design, Lizardking & Mantronix. Winner of Party Remedy 1995!
  Review: There's one very good thing and one very bad thing about
  Dalahorse. The good thing is undoutedly the music. Lizardking and
  D-Design deliver a stonking techno tune as the main soundtrack, one of
  those pieces of music that can lift a demo all on it own...almost.
  The bad thing is its speed. Even on my 030-50 it snails along, never
  quite managing to keep the update rate up. Despite some innovation, this
  is what brings this demo down. You can't help thinking they should have
  spent some more time on these routines. Also known as 'Falukorv'.
    I belive, from the way the files are set up, that this would run quite
  happily from disk. Anyone?

Cooperation and Roadrunners decided to join forces. Their first production,
announcing this, was released two days later at the Bamiga Sector One and
The Warfalcons party in Denmark. The original members were (I believe) all
Danish. They were; BJ, Codex, Cruncher, Droopy, Jake Up, Jason, Joz, Obx,
Raz, Static, Thrasher, Vandal, XOD and Yoyo. Cruncher (den, Rasmus Hartmann)
suddenly sold his Amiga and left the scene 08/89, only six months after he
helped found Rebels. Danish coder Proxt left for Panzerfaust (now Cave).
  1990 - Jake released issues of his pack "Candyland", and Nick & Zaxxan
released issues of their pack "Sweetest Perfection". Australian members The
Teacher and The Corporal left for Scoopex. Swedes Alta (code), Fuzzac (code,
02/90), Marillion (music, 02/90) and Mogwie (code) all joined The Silents,
but Mogwie later rejoined.
  1991 - The Austrian division got kicked around easter 1991. Nick & Zaxxan
released issues of their pack "Sweetest Perfection". Labyrinth was kicked
out, so he joined TRSI late 91.
  1992 - Early in the year they were reinforced with the Germans Chaos,
Diddle, Zaphod, 16 Beat, Jester, Cthulu, Hawk, Cruiser, Vindicator and
Panther from Sanity, but their stay was a brief one and they soon returned
to try and rebuild their old group. They left behind only one production;
the intro "Sanity Is Dead".
  1993 - The year started disastrously for Rebels, when january brought on a
mass migration to a new group formed almost exclusively of ex-Rebels
members; Movement. The group was founded by dutch musician 911 (ex The
Silents) and Finnish organizer Meegosh, and soon many key members had moved
on to the new group. A.o. Swedish trader Logic (ex Noxious), dutch Astro (ex
The Silents), finnish musician Nugget (ex NKOTB), finnish coder Jef (old
handle MCD), finnish coder Ruben (old handle Willow), finnish sysop Storm
('WASTED TIME', 07/91-), danish Toastmaster (ex Bacteria, new late92), and
Turkish 'Eternal' editors Orion and Kris (ex Accuracy, new mid92). Since
Meegosh was the previous world leader (since mid 92), a new one had to be
chosen, and Jake took over the reins of the group. In the weeks and months
to follow, also Swedish coder Asterix (old handle Alta, 02/90-), Swedish
musician Omega (12/91-) and French musician Reflex (ex Delight, new
late91-10/91) joined Movement. I don't know what happened in the meantime,
but 12/93 Bozo is suddenly the new main organizer! Frenchmen Meta (ex Bass)
and Patrick (both early93) both left to reform Bass mid to late 93.

  Several of the original Danish and Swedish members returned to be members
of Rebels again after the group was reborn in 1994. Danes who returned were
a.o. Bozo (mainorg trade pack, 12/92-10/93), Conan (code, 03/89-12/91) and
Static (music, 03/90).

Danish coder, and one of the original founders, Droopy (02-08/89) was
  mentioned 12/92 as a member of Rebels PC, so he probably went over to that
  division at one time or the other. -- Raz (founder code gfx music swap,
  02-06/89). Q (code).

Danish Xience joined Rednex.
Danish sysop Stripe ('HIGH TENSION') joined The Silents.
Norwegian sysop Raven ('WONDERLAND', 91) got kicked.
Danish musician Unison (12/92) was later in Impact DK.
English sysop Clairvoyant ('FORGOTTEN REALMS', 02/92) joined Dual Crew
  03/92.
Finnish musician Maza (ex Accession, new RAW4, 12/92) joined Sonic (RAW5).
Finnish trader Zakka (ex Spaceballs, new RAW4, 03/93) changed his handle to
  Black Sheep and joined Alpha Flight (RAW5).
Danish coder Xarium (ex Bacteria, new RAW4, 12/92) and trader Bizarre joined
  Angels new.
German swapper Speedhawk (12/92) changed his handle to Elric and joined
  Essence.
Rogue left for the PC scene.
Norwegian graphician Skywalker (12/92) joined Cryptoburners.
Danish organizer, swapper and trader Janitor (new 10/90-02/92) joined Kaos
  Design, the Crack Inc subgroup.
Finnish Hoover (ex Brainstorm) left to work commercially.
The Swedish division has many internal problems, because mainorg M:ET
  (trade), Nick (swe mainorg trade, later RBS PC? 12/91), Portwer (Johan
  Ramsay, trade sysop 'EQUIPOISE', ex Noxious, 12/92), Dragon (sysop
  'DRAGON'S LAIR', ex Dual Crew, later RBS PC? 02/92) and Wico (sysop
  'INNER CIRCLE', ex Scoopex, 02/92) all left the Amiga scene to start a new
  PC group called THE EDGE.
Frenchmen Skynet and Suny (gfx) joined Anarchy.
Danish musician, graphician and one of the founders, Static (02-08/89)
  joined Paradox, then rejoined 12/90. He then joined The Silents. He later
  returned once again to take part in the new Rebels when they were reborn
  in 1994.
The entire Swedish division (except M:ET who joined Cascade) joined The
  Silents. However, many of them has since returned - like M:ET, Alta, Vic.
Finnish Heatbeat (music) and Dweezil (code) got kicked. Instead of joining
  some other crew, the two decided to form Carillon.
French coder Dca (ex Delight, new late91) joined Anarchy.
Hitchcock joined Extreme.
Danish Trix (ex Dexion) joined Anarchy in mid 91. However, in RAW3 (quite a
  lot later!) it was claimed he was simply kicked.
Swedish coder Jas joined Phenomena.
Dutch trader and musician Mark (ex The Silents, 12/92) joined Banal
  Projects.
Frenchmen Albatros and Hof (gfx, 92) joined Alliance Design.
French trader (and sysop 'ARTIFICIAL DREAMS'?) Rhod joined Anarchy.
When Kefrens died, R.W.O and S.L.L both joined, but left after 14 days to
  form Hydronic. In addition, ICronite and Milkshake joined, but
  immediately moved on to Anarchy.

  code: Jef, gfx: Hansie (logo), music: "Intromuz-1" by Heatbeat.
  review: Another nicely designed Rebels intro, this one's even a cut

  with a bouncy Heatbeat tune make for some very cool entertainment!

· Rebel Without A Cause (ECS Intro).
  code: Paleface, gfx: Seen/Alliance Design, Krest (title, ice font),
  music: "Test1" by Yoyo.
  review: With an unusually high amount of effects for a BBS intro, this
  one kicks off with a respectable picture by new member Krest, based on
  the title picture of an old game called 'Baal'. Then there are effects, a
  text plotter and even a sinus scroll! Though the intro works best with
  KillAGA, a few effects still have (non-fatal) graphical errors. The intro
  destabilized my system after exiting, so a reboot is definitely
  recommended after seeing this intro. Paleface and Seen were later the two
  people behind the runaway success group Melon Dezign.
    This intro seems to introduced new member Krest, as well as calling
  PANTEON 'our new world headquarter'. No release date appears anywhere in
  the demo.

· Wild Side BBS Intro (ECS Intro).

  review: Nothing spectacular here, and far from their strongest BBS intro.
  The show opens with a fullscreen picture, which is the best part, and
  from then on just plots text onto uninteresting background stuff.
  This intro announced Mogwie's joining, Analog Kid's joining, and the fact
  that the French section is NOT dead, despite rumours in some diskmags -
  among others Stolen Data.
    A reset is recommended after running this intro, since it made at least
  my system highly unstable after being run.

  code: Droopy, gfx^music: Static.
  Released at the Digitech - IBB Summer Conference 89.
  review: This one's a quite simple demo, with the obligatory logo at the
  top and the obligatory scroller at the bottom :) The scroller's jumping
  up and down in time to the music, making it hard to read. I'm sorry, but
  this is uninnovative, boring, and incompetent. Get the picture?
  The scrolltext of this demo makes me almost believe this was
  hacked out of Rebels' Megademo...? The release date is assuming it was
  actually released at the summer conference.

  review: Errr...right. A theme demo of that lovable green cartoon
  character The Incredible Hulk! Well, it's original if nothing else :)
  The demo has an animated Rebels logo at the top, a digitized Hulk with
  some spotlights flying around him, and a scroller on the bottom. OK,
  not exactly revolutaionary, is it? One thing that amused me quite a bit
  was the text before the scroller - 'Mess with the best, Die like the
  rest'. Seems familiar to anyone? Interpol? Taus' first real demo.

  Just a blue logo, selection in the middle of the screen by mouse, and two
  scrollers at the very bottom of the screen. Very very ordinary. The module
  is not in standard MOD format, may be a packer - no poss to check yet.

  review: "Waterproof" is a multi-demo demo, if that makes any sense :)
  What I mean is you load the thing, and you're presented with a small demo
  part from which you can select three other parts.
    I only got this to work once on my machine, though I tried numerous
  times. Therefore credits are only an approximation based on the
  information I could retrieve.

  manages to quite take off. The demo was supposed to be released for the
  TSL and Red Sector party (which was held 29.06 1990), it says, so it was
  probably released later then :)
  Though the demo runs with KillAGA, it is far from perfect.

  code: Newton, gfx: Newton, Krest (ice font), music: Tip/Phenomena.
  review: This cool little intro was made to announce their new BBS
  'REBELS' HIDEOUT'. As far as BBS intros go, this is not half bad, with
  some plasma-like effect and some cool vectors. Though the demo works
  perfectly fine on the 030, it's _WAY_ too fast. Also the music replayer
  seems to choke on the extra horsepower, so KillAGA is hereby recommended
  even though it's not essential. Why this small 50k intro doesn't have an
  exit is beyond me.

  Review: The then-new Finnish division's first production is a fun little

  the first Heatbeat tune I ever remember hearing, and placed him firmly in
  my mind as a talent for the future...and he did not let anyone of us down!

  review: Just a one-screen intro from the Finnish division. It contains no

  production) and Heatbeat getting kicked. Anyway, nothing special - just a
  vector variation and a scroller. Nicely put together, though.

  review: Another onescreener this, with a scroller on top, an acceptable

  me, it's not as bad as it sounds. Design is pretty much as good as it
  gets for this kind of thing. Music is a chiptune, though quite a dynamic,
  good little number.

  Review: This one's a bit curious... It's just a cartoon picture and a
  tune. In the picture you can see the following text: 'Claude's Runner.
  Call Belgium at +32-91334268' and 'A Rebels Product'. Probably a BBS
  intro of some kind, but it's still a bit weird... Anyway, get it for
  the tune, which is classic vintage Heatbeat...beautiful melancholy!

  review: A small intro, but with tons of style, this one is mainly based
  on its animated background, with a lot of small filled vectorboxes and
  some other moving stuff. Fonts and design are perfectly fine, making this
  a competent little package. Just the way I like my BBS intros: Short,
  sweet and to the point!

  review: This one opens in style, with a fullscreen picture by Hof,
  showing a semi-naked woman and a cool Rebels logo! The chart system
  itself is perhaps not the best ever seen, but still nice visuals and
  audials certainly help the production along. The charts concern the modem
  scene only, and are of stuff like 'best uploaders'. There's no indication
  of when it was released other than the tune, which says it's from 1992.

  review: I can't really judge this fairly, as I have never actually
  watched it. The intro WORKS, as such, but the graphics are all scrambled
  up - even with KillAGA. There is a nice opening logo we get to see, tho'.
    No release date appears anywhere in the intro, so the VERY general
  release date is based on some known facts; the Finnish division's first
  production was "Snap" (91). Ruben and Nugget were in their new group
  Movement early 93, so it had to be made somewhere between those two
  dates. The name of the intro refers to the three days spent making it.

  review: Another one-screen intro, this... It's got a vector cube with a
  moving lightsource and a realtime-rendering fractal on it as the main
  effect. On top of this there's a one-plane font with various information
  about the Assembly'92 party. The module was dated 25.04, so obviously
  this intro was released on or after that date.

Rebels was once a major force on the demo scene, but activity has decreased
somewhat in later years. They now seem to be on their way back, though,
with some activity evident from coder Krustur and musician Jerry.
ROM4 reported rumours that german graphician TeeVaan had left the scene in
order to produce game graphics.
  1994 - Shortly after being reformed, the German section released their
first demo, "Prurient" (94). It was quickly followed by the winner of the
Doomsday party, "Switchback" (10/94), and the Rebels seemed to be back on
track! The finished the year at the party with "Whammer Slammer", the third
demo in a row by german duo Zulu and Grey. Sometime between 04 and 05/94,
swedish sysop Dracula ('TRANSYLVANIA', 03/94-) left the group. Bozo became
mainorg. Sometime between 05 and 10/94, germans Siriax (Dennis Lewerenz,
trade sysop 'CRAP TOWER', new 04/94-), Toxic (Sven Dedek, gfx, later
Abyss, new 05/94-) and Dynamite (Sirko Zidlewitz, music, 04/94-), as well as
danes Angel (trade, 03/94-), D-Siya (modemorg trade, 03/94-), Ice Lord
(Mikael, gfx, 03/94-), Janitor (trade, 03/94-), Static (Anders Bukh, music,
03/94-), Strike (Jesper Knudsen, trade, 03/94-), Xod (Morton Plass, gfx,
still in the pc section? 03/94-) and Yoyo (Karsten Kiems, music, 03/94-)
left the group. Sometime between 09 and 10/94, German sysop MDB (Carsten
Lewandowsky, 'LOVE LIKE BLOOD') left the group.
  1995 - After three strong demo releases in 1994, the new year presented
us with total silence! It was also this year that German organizers Exciter
(Ingo Kamps) and Weezer decided to leave the scene. Things were further
complicated when his replacement, the dane Nighthawk (Steffen Karstoft, gfx,
ex Majic 12, 03/94-) also decided to leave the scene in August, after moving
over to England to study! His replacement - in turn - would be the swede
Swoop, hopefully a more permanent solution. Swedish graphician Slime (Ola
Wiklander, 09/94-12/95) left the scene towards the end of the year, after
his computer died. Danish cofounder and earlier main organizer Bozo
(Flemming Ljungdahl, 02/94-) also sadly decided to leave the scene towards
the end of the year.
  1996 - The year started tragically, as a lightning bolt took out Twister's
board 'FLASHBACK' in january. After some consideration, Twister (Anders
Lindquist) and fellow swede graphician Disc (Mats Erikson, ex Tetragon
UPS10/Equinox ROM3, 95-) were asked to leave the group. Around the same time
Norwegian sysop Jedi (Hans Petter Andersen, ex Puzzle) decided to leave the
Amiga scene for his career in a pc cracking group. March saw the recruitment
of CyberState and Jerry in Norway. We wouldn't see a new Rebels production
until after the middle of the year, when their new danish recruitment Fresh
Prince secured them a winning 64k intro at the South Sealand Party. The only
other release this year was the norwegian section's "Chip Nostalgia". In
august, danish musician Vocal (Andre Greve, 03/94-) was kicked, after he
bought a pc, and no contact had been made in months. Swoop continued to lead
the group throughout the year.
  1997 -

Danish graphician, musician and also eventually sysop Bird (new 01/96-
  02/97) joined Scoopex to work with his friend Boogeyman (ROM9). For a
  while in 96, Bird also ran the board 'ELEKTRIK CAFE'.
Swedish coder Lussar'n (ex Medicine, new early94-) left Rebels after about
  a year of scene inactivity (ROM8) and joined Craze late 96.
Red Cheese joined Passion late 95.
Germans Zulu and Grey (code, ex DCS, new 94-95), Excess (raytrace, 04/94-
  95) and Cueball (code raytrace, 04/94-95) all left for Essence (ROM5).
  Zulu & Grey came 3rd in the music competition at The Party 1994 with "A
  Kind of Love", but actually, they didn't compose the tune at all, it was
  just delivered by them for their friend Chromag, who couldn't attend :)
German swapper Ghandy (09-10/94) joined Bonzai Brothers (ROM4).
Danish coder Ozone (03-10/94) is now only in the PC division (ROM3).
German musician Mel'o'Dee (Heiko Klueh, 09-10/94) was asked to leave along
  with the others in the cleanup specified below. After that, he chose to
  leave the scene. He is now composing music professionally, trying to earn
  some money that way.
A major clean-up was performed, reducing the amount of members from 40 to
  25. Among the people that had to leave were Mr.Magoo (Nicki K. Jensen, den
  code, old handle Xariun, 03-10/94), Mr.Orion (Kennet Bendixen, den
  modemorg, new 09-10/94), Weird Dream (Lars Schmidt, den swap trade, ex

Red Sector was born in the spring of 1985, when Bill Best, Kangol Kid and
Greg decide to join forces under this label. At this time, the group's
members were spread over America and Canada. Towards the end of 1985 Irata
and Mr.Zeropage formed the European section. Irata became the group's main
trader. Red Sector ran the first ever Canadian bulletin board. All this was
on the C64, but when the Amiga 1000 appeared in 1986, PBA, MZP, Bill Best,
Irata and ECA all bought one. The first Red Sector intro on the Amiga was
released in early 1987, and was coded by HQC. Twilight coded the second
RSI intro, with music by the father of SoundTracker, Karsten Obarski.
In 1987, RSI entered into their first cooperation, with Def Jam. It was not
only their first cooperation, but the first ever cooperation on the Amiga!
However, it didn't last too long. The C64 section was officially disbanded
in 1988, and everyone moved over to the Amiga. Years later, it was
restarted by Mr.President, Irata and Mr.Cursor, but that's another story.
1988 was also the year of the first big busts. Irata was, for example,
visited by the police in the morning of the 24th of october, but they found
only five disks. RSI had hard times, and started to look at other venues for
their activities. They recruited TCC as their demo division, and 9 months
later their baby was born: the Red Sector "Megademo" [09/89]! This demo took
them to the undisputable top of the demoscene, and made legends of its
makers.
  1990 - As a demo group, you can perhaps talk of RSI pre- and post-
"Megademo". 1990 started well, with the successful releases of the mag
"Criminal" [02/90] and the demo "CeBit '90" [03/90]. Onyx left Vision
Factory since he was frustrated with the internal organizing of the group,
and joined in february. Later in the year they would enter into a
cooperation with Tristar, the result of which we all know. TRSI was born.
Big thanks to an article about TRSI in ROM #4 for massive amounts of source
material for this precise history! Please excuse us if this seems like a
straight rewrite of your article, Mop. If it's too close to the original
text, consider it a tribute rather than a ripoff :) I really couldn't word
it better than you.
  If Dr.C's real name, Holger Kruse, seems familiar it's probably because
he's the author of one of the most-used utilities for Amiga InterNet users
these days, the TCP/IP stack utility "Miami".

German musician Bit Arts (02/90) joined Sanity. He did some of the best
  tunes for RSI's "Megademo" [09/89], and is probably best remembered for
  that.
German Beatmaster joined End of Century 1999.
Swedish sysop Istvan ('MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE', ex Empire) joined Fairlight late
  1990.
Danish musician S.L.L (87) joined Bamiga Sector One in 88.

  review: A rather simple into, but nice nevertheless. It's just a flipping
  logo at the top, and a sinescroller below. The real aim of this intro is
  to announce the new Danish members Pendec, Caucasian and Metal Force.
  It doesn't mention a release date anywhere.
    The intro will start on my machine, with the help of KillAGA, but has
  to this day never exited without taking my machine down.

  Review: Words cannot describe what the RSI Megademo meant for the scene
  at its time of release. It was a breath of fresh air, a show of force so
  powerful that noone dared deny the fact that it was a modern classic from
  the moment it was released. The design and - not least - the music gave
  it a very special atmosphere that I can safely say is still there when
  viewing it today. I have never been more spellbound by a demo, or watched
  a demo more times than this. An amazing achievement.
    SHD/Mystic made a one file version fixed for HD/AGA. It still had its
  flaws (graphics/music bugs, endpart crash), but at least it made the demo
  available to the new generation Amigas! This review refers to that fix,
  and not the original trackloaded demo. Therefore there is no
  compatibility reference.

. Criminal No.1 (1990, .02, ECS Filemag).
  INT - code: Onyx, music: "Telephone" by n/a (SoundTracker format).
  MAG - code: Zeronine/Quadlite, gfx: Dennis, music: Psygnosis (ripped),
        editors: Irata (main, aka The Editor), John Player, Xymox, Dr.Soft.
  review: The intro preceding Criminal is a classic, and one they've used
  many times before. There's a flipping scroller across the middle of the
  screen, and some different copper-color stuff rolling across the
  background. It's actually nicely done, but probably turned a few more
  heads when it was first shown in 1988, than it did today. Remarkably, it
  ran perfectly on my system, without even the need for KillAGA. And then
  there's that truly classic piece of music, "Telephone"... The intro
  announces Onyx as a new member, and the intro was coded by him back in
  1988 - used here as a kind of nostalgic nod to the past.
    Then we enter the mag itself, which has a quite unique design. It's
  built with a small display at the top of the screen, and the rest of the
  screen displaying the text. It's controlled with the mouse, and clicks of
  the mouse takes you around the pages. Like a lot of the first mags, there
  are just numbered pages, and no chapters or anything like that. The
  display is white text on a grey background, and has an overall nice
  design. Contentwise this issue doesn't really contain a lot, and the joke
  pages in German was totally unnecessary, but... The best thing about
  Criminal though, is the FEELING - the kind of friendship that only
  existed in the oldschool scene, a feeling that these guys actually KNEW
  each other, and were good friends. It's something that unfortunately
  will most likely never reappear.
    The mag was published simultaneously on disk and paper (sortof like
  Jeff Smart's legendary "Illegal" for the c64 scene), and was supposed to
  come out with a new issue every second month from the start.
  Unfortunately, that never happened - this issue was the only one to ever
  be released. When you press the EXIT button, the mag resets, but
  unfortunately does something strange to the memory too... I softkick 3.1
  in my startup, using an application called BlizKick, and after running
  Criminal I was suddenly told that the jumpers on my card were not set
  correctly for me to softkick. I tried a couple of times, but ultimately
  had to turn off and on the machine to make it work...

  code: Delta, gfx: Dr.C (logo, little font), Dark (titlepic, logo,

  Released at the CeBIT '90 exposition.
  review: This old Red Sector classic is a formula demo if ever I saw one.
  You've got your logo on top, your scroller on the bottom, and in the
  middle you've got yer basic vector effects. Ok, as far as these go, CeBit
  isn't the worst you can get. Though hardly worthy the 'classic' title it
  has claimed, it's still worth a honourable mention for reasonable vector
  rutines (for the time) and OK design. The music, though, is fabulous.
    On my machine there were a few minor errors on the vectors, probably
  due to the speed of my machine. Ripping the tune is easy, just depack the
  executable with xfd or Unpack, and rip it. It's a standard MOD.

  Anyway, this intro SUCKS! If it didn't crash all the time, I'd exit it
  myself :) There's NO graphics to speak of, the code is first-try-at-asm
  quality, and the music's just plain annoying. Avoid.
