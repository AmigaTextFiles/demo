  review: A true horror example of generic design, this follows the two
  magic formulas; the logo-bar-effect-bar screen layout and the effect-
  textscreen-effect rhythm. The music and graphics are barely functional.
  The music in the opening part, that chip-style thing, seems unrippable.
    The music in the main part bugs (note: cons says it's not the music, but
  the code to fade out the track), and it crashes after loading the endpart.
  It boots the whole thing, then gurus. However, the main part of the demo
  worked perfectly. No time to check with caches off. Thanks to CONS for
  clearing a few things up, like the music credits! =]

Paradise was a German demo group, formed by Tedric in april 1991, and
organized by Tedric and Arcatronic. The group died mid to late 1993.
  Originally, there were two other groups called Paradise, one of which was
also based in Germany, and one cracker group in Belgium. This was solved
easily though, when all three groups fusioned into one. However, the
Belgian people didn't stay long, and opted to go to Fusion instead.
When they left, rumours that Paradise had died starting floating around,
which were untrue.

Paradox was originally formed late 1989 by members of the danish group
Trilogy (Bad Boy, Black Hawk) and the french group M.A.D (Olivier, The
Surge, Clash) with the intention of forming the mightiest cracking
constellation ever. Leaders of the group were originally The Surge, Midnight
Maniac and Olivier, with Blackhawk and The Surge doing most of the cracking.
Suppliers were Action Man, Spirit and Paragon. With this setup PDX was
immediately one of the top amiga cracking groups, and were staples on the
top of the charts from day one. Thanks to the history published on the
group's website for some information.
  1990 - During 1990, Paradox were at war with another cracking group,
Angels, which culminated in the famous intro from Skywalker, where a devil
is brutally molesting a defenseless angel :) MayDay stopped all activities
late 90. The Danish board 'HALLOWED GROUND' (03-06/90) had to close its
doors late 90, since the Danish police had started to suspect what was going
on. German sysop Skyline joined around october. Danes Static, Vandal and
Droopy joined Rebels in december.
  1991 - Tension grew within the group until it eventually died. When this
happened, most of the members joined Quartex (confirmed: TIC (crack, 90) and
The Surge (mainorg crack sysop, 11/90)). Paradox went into hibernating, but
the group was reactivated after two years.

Paradox was reborn i 1993 with Daryl/ex Shining as one of the leaders.
Midnight Maniac was back (albeit with a slightly lower profile than
earlier), Blackhawk was still one of the scene's most prolific crackers, and
Paragon still one of the best suppliers. Paradox were the undisputed number
one in its second incarnation. Maximilien was the new leader, and new
members like Zool (italy) and Lincoln (germany) helped raise the group even
further. The group now expanded, for the first time, into the console scene.
Releases were made on the SNES and Sega Genesis, under the able hands of
Belgarion (code) and Papillon (org). Even more challenges were sought, and
the group turned its attention to the pc scene...
  1993 - Kaoz and swapper Killraven (early93) were kicked. Killraven joined
Anthrox late 93.
  1994 - French coder Ninja (12/93, in Angels three months earlier) left to
join Scoopex. French musician Monty (12/93) left to form Universal Soldiers
with his friend Schmoovy-Schmoov/Complex in late 94.
  1995 - Then the group's leader Maximilien was busted by the police, once
again killing Paradox in the process... Paradox would be reborn a third time
after two more years, in 1997, but now entirely on the console scene.

  code: Ninja, gfx: CPT, music: Monty (ProPacker 2.1 format).
  10th in The Party 93 40k intro competition.
  Review: Not much content here, though nicely designed. Still, when you
  compare this to Ninja's last intro "Destroy Fascism" (For Angels three
  months earlier), this is undoubtedly the weaker one. The only real
  'effect' is some vector-spheres bouncing on a moving vector-plate thing
  that's not all that exciting. It seems there's a 'theme' of sorts to
  this, where two chickens find love. Don't ask. Music and gfx are
  simplistic, but acceptable. Ninja reprises his upscroller with vector-
  tunnel in the background routine from "Destroy Fascism" in the endpart.

Paranoimia (-1990)
------------------
USA> Al Capone (sysop 'ALCATRAZ', early90).

Boards; FBI BBS (usa).

Paranoimia was an elite cracking group built on the ruins of the legendary
World of Wonders, and became a legendary group in their own right. Among the
ones from the old group were Kontrasoft and Metallica. I believe they were
in several wars with other groups, and were popularly called 'Paralamia' :).
However, the most fantastic claims came when they were rumoured to be the
computer division of the actual Mafia! Their exact date of birth is a little
uncertain, but the earliest dated crack I have seen was 18.05-89. The
American 'FBI BBS' was carrried over from World of Wonders.
  1990 - Two Danish members joined Supreme ca 05/90. German Malzam (ex
Tristar) was briefly a member before moving on to Vision. Paranoimia then
died sometime between 06 and 08/90. Metallica, Hellion and Corsair (all ex
World of Wonders) joined Skid Row. Most others formed The Company with ex
members of Quartex. Skid Row did have an American board called 'ALCATRAZ',
but the sysop was called Beatbox...He may have changed his handle... Kreator
took some time before finally joining Prologic.

German musician Subzero joined Skid Row.
German cracker Kontrasoft (ex World of Wonders) left the scene.
German sysop Guru Josh ('TECH' opened 12/89) joined Tristar.
Their WHQ BBS (USA) was busted! (mid 90). This may be the bbs they got from
  M.A.D in early 1990, presumably DEVILS ISLAND.

Parasite was originally founded by Dino and Peter. The original founders
later left, and declared the group to be dead. An attempt to revive it was
made by Danish superswapper Speedy, but this was quickly denied by the
original founders, now active on the PC. See the entry for Parasite [new]
for more information on this. The two founders now run Parasite PC, and
the Amiga section is officially dead and will never be revived.
  News in EuroChart #15 (declaring the group's birth) reported that Dino,
Slide, Mount, Easley, Shayera and Gargoyle all came here from Cult, which
conflicts rather extensively with my information... Can anyone confirm or
deny if Shayera's PST-Tracker (12/92) was ever released?

Passion is a demo group based in Denmark.
  1997 - Swapper Adonis joined Amaze Design late97. Ibenz left for Digital
around 09/97.

Danish graphician Silicon (11/94-08/95) joined Rebels (ROM9).
Danish graphician Prowler (12/94-12/95) left to join Scoopex (ROM9).
Organizers Pearl (Martin Serup, swap edit "Dansktoppen", 11/94) and The
  Whistle (code music, 11/94) have both left the scene, which makes PSN's
  future highly uncertain. Silicon is still in, but the destiny of the
  remaining PSN members Guybrush, Prowler and Cutcreator is unknown. Their
  contact with the group in the last months were very scarce (ROM8). Does
  this mean we can declare Passion dead?
Danish musician Subject (doublememb Balance, 11/94) terminated his double
  membership, changed his handle to Prophet and joined Scoopex 01/97.
Danish swapper Decoy (ex Control, 11/94-03/96) joined Puzzle (ROM8).
Talented danish coders Boogeyman (ex Oblivion, new 11/94) and Scope (ex
  Balance) both joined Scoopex (ROM8).
Ramosa (Jacob Ramskov, Music, 11/94, ex Oblivion?) and Tsar1 (swap) were
  both asked to leave, while sysop Webster ('ELECTRONIC CONFUSION') left
  the scene completely (04/96^ROM7).

· Passionate (1994, 22.11, File).
  Code: The Whistle, Gfx: Silicon, Guybrush, Blizzart, Music: "Brave_New_
  WorldV1.1" by Ramosa (Tracker Packer 3 format).
  Review: It doesn't CONTAIN anything, does it? There's a few not-too-good
  pictures, the odd uninteresting effect or two... But now, having watched
  it, I can't remember a single outstanding thing. Dull. The first ever
  PSN production.

  Code: The Whistle, Gfx: Silicon, Blizzart, Music: "Alien_Dream" by Ramosa
  (Tracker Packer 3 format). 19th in The Party 4 demo competition.
  Review: A lot better than The Whistle's previous 'Passionate', though
  he's reused one or two effecs. The opening picture of the grinning green
  head by Silicon was later used in Boogeyman's 'Vacation 2' also, though
  in a different context. Anyway, the best parts of 'Alien Dream' is
  probably the music and the tunnel parts. Nice and subtle, this is.
  Oh, and the small picture in the endpart was nice too. Approved.
  AGA only, but for no apparent reason.

  Review: Again, this is good! Boogeyman keeps impressing, as a coder that
  cares about how his productions look. There's plenty of goodlooking
  effects, including a variation I've never seen before! We're shown smooth
  and good stuff like a voxelspace, phong, bitmap manipulation, texture
  mapping, bitmap interference with smileys :), and a new combination;
  gouraud glenz! The endpart looks a lot like Lone Starr/Spaceball's
  intro for R.A.W #5, don't you think?
    The accompanying text file mentions it requires 'some fast'.

  Code: Boogeyman, Music: "Gatecrashing-4" by Subject (TrackerPacker 2 or 3

  Review: Very good. This is competent in all areas, with a functional tune
  and good, strong, solid routines. Everything here - from the zooming
  intro, the zoomrotated stretching plasma, the 'dungeon', the fast blue
  tunnel, to the envmapped objects - is done in goodlooking style with fast
  routines. It's a consistently solid production. If they'd left out the
  dungeon part and substituted it for a picture or an improved tune, I'd be
  over the moon. As it is, I'm just slightly hovering :) Passion obviously
  lost a great resource when Boogeyman joined Scoopex.

PHA was a formed around 1988 by a guy called Avalon, who later left the
scene. A successor of the group Crack Force Five, they were a swedish-only
crew, stressing friendship as an important reason for this rule. Years
later, of course, Andromeda would do the same thing. A pure demo group,
they are perhaps the ones that made the best trackmo of all times; the
fantastic "Enigma" [03/91]. While Scoopex' "Mental Hangover" [04/90] was the
first trackmo, "Enigma" was the one that truly defined the standards of the
genre. Unfortunately, after topping the charts for ages, Azatoth lost his
initiative to code.
  Coder Celebrandil was one of the last great innovators if the scene, a.o.
things introducing raytracing to demos in 1988. He also invented the much-
used effects glenz vector and spacecut vector. Today he is working designing
ICs for Stockholm-based firm Mentor Graphics, though he's still coding on
his spare time - though sadly on the PC. Mr.Gurk was the author of one of
the most-loved utils for the coder of the early days; the sinus-generator
Cosaque (version 1.1 30.08.1989).
  Another of their coders, Vogue, would later move to the PC scene, where
he joined a group called Triton, helped code their demos "Crystal Dream"
(07/92) and "Crystal Dream II" (05/93), before he and Mr.H committed the
music tracker program known as "FastTracker ][" (94). He is now busy
co-writing the game "Into the Shadows".
  1990 - After Uno's contribution to the Scoopex demo "Chromium" in
november, he (gfx), Photon (code), Judas and Invid all joined Scoopex a
month later, in december.

Swedish coder Odeon (ex Majic 12) left to form the new Razor 1911 (RAW6).
Swedish graphician Terminator (03/90-04/91) joined The Silents. Terminator
  worked on several classic Phenomena releases, including Music Dream II
  (91) and Enigma [03/91].
Swedish coder Antiaction (ex Vortex 42) joined Defjam.

  Winner of Dexion Party demo competion!
  review: Good code and a great tune arre the best parts of this demo,
  which managed to climb all the way to the top at the classic Dexion
  party. The design is decidedly old-school, with a terrible logo at the
  top (Havok would later join Anarchy and Sanity and make great graphics),
  a scroller at the bottom and some effects in the middle of the screen.
  The effects are all quite acceptable, and probably pretty advanced by the
  standards of back then.
    This was presumably Celebrandil's first demo for Phenomena, since
  there's some text explaining why he left Fairlight. ADL mentioned it
  didn't work on the A1200, which puzzles me since it works perfectly
  fine here.

  Winner of demo competition at the Anarchy Easter Party 91!
  Review: Azatoth proved to be a coder with a talent the like of which is
  seldom seen, when he created ENIGMA! Amazingly, this was only his second
  released demo. As soon as the first bears of the amazing title theme
  opens the show to a 3d starfield with overlaid credits, you sort of feel
  you're in for something a little special... And you have probably never
  been more right. Perhaps the demo with the most new ideas EVER, it set
  the standards for others to follow in the trackmo genre. Just amazing!
    It seems Uno contributed to this AFTER he left for Scoopex, since the
  ENIGMA logo is signed UNO SCX. The logo in the Star Wars scroller part is
  signed Imbecille, though he's not credited anywhere in the demo. I only
  experiences one slight problem when running it, there are some graphical
  errors in the ligtsourced world part. Otherwise everything went smoothly.

  Code: Jas, Gfx: Color, Music: Tip and Mantronix.
  Review: Now a pure Phenomena production, CS2 still bears strong
  resemblances the the first edition. The fact that the same basic code
  has been used has perhaps a little to do with that... Style-wise, this
  is as smooth as it gets, with exceptional music, smooth graphics and a
  damn-near perfect code. Lots of options, including volume control and
  lots of scrollers to read. A true classic.

  Review: This is an early issue of 'the mag with no articles', Generation.
  It's basically just a news-and-ad mag, the kind that's more usually
  called a packmag these days. It's small, though, so why it wasn't made a
  one-file mag is beyond me. There's nothing that stands out here, either
  way. The graphics are functional, but not good, and the same goes for the
  music. Not too exciting. Can't find a release date anywhere here, so I
  had to guess. My guess is based on the news; it often collided with SLH11
  and sometimes with RAW4.

  Review: Certainly no doubt that Pointless have squeezed at lot of the 30k
  of diskspace that this intro occupies. This intro is BRIMMING with
  effects of varying quality. The best bits are the remarkably great
  Pointless logo (which reminded me a lot of Fade One's twisty logos!) and
  a fast, good 3D dot landscape. Other things here are a 2x2 fractal zoom,
  a fast linedrawer, a zoomrotating 'Iltis' logo, and a 3D starfield.
  The music is the real letdown, with its techno overkill approach.
  Not bad at all, and certainly not pointless :)

Polka Brothers were originally born mostly as a Danish joke group with
members doublejoining in from other groups. The original memberlist, as
shown in POLKA BROTHER? demo, were Airwalk/Kefrens, Vention/Kefrens,
Easley/Parasite, Twilight/Desire, Mount/Parasite and Dice/Kefrens.
Of these, Twilight later left the scene to make game music for Craftgold.
  Polka Brothers will definitely live on in the annals of demo history as
one of the crews that brought humour to demos in a big way. Together with
the pioneers Budbrain and Melon., these are probably the FUNNIEST groups!
Four german ex-Complex members teamed up in december 94, one of which
promptly won The Party 4 intro competition for them!
  Danish coder Airwalk was totally gone from the scene fro two years, from
1995 to 1997, but now seems to be doing a comeback of sorts! The reason for
Airwalk's disappearance was that he had to serve in the army. Apparently,
he liked it there and stayed for two years! He is now back, however, has
picked up coding again, and will probably be releasing something for the
Polka Brothers in the near future!
  Another danish coder, Vention (ex Kefrens) left to work for FunCom in
Norway in 1994, and stayed in the country. In late 97/early 98 he popped up
again, this time as a member of Scoopex!

German coder Raw Style (ex Complex, new 12/94) left pretty soon to join the
  bright new German hope Lego in early 95.
Danish musician Tivurr (ex Kefrens, old handle Dice, new UPS10) joined
  Movement (ROM4). This seems unlikely, given that he worked on No!
  (12/95)... Perhaps he later rejoined?

  Review: This seems like a sort of first production, introducing the Polka
  Brothers to the world. There are some stuff inbetween the various text
  pages, like dots falling down on a spinning vector plate, but nothing to
  shout about. On the 030, the text pages switch so fast it's hard to read
  them though before it moves on to the next one.

  Some might find the 'spank my monkey' animation tasteless, but I guess
  that's all down to your sense of humour. This is not extraordinary in any

  Review: It never lets up for a second, but just keeps going from start
  to finish. Polished but rough, and with a great sense of design, the
  german Crash dominates the Party 4 intro competition! Another great
  factor in the success of this intro is the music by Chromag, which also
  helps the adrenalin-pumping. Best part: The fabulously fast voxel routine
  which actually looks like mountains! Fabulous. Excellent. Awesome!

  Review: Not bad early AGA demo, featuring ex-superstar Merge aka Laxity.
  This demo is most amusing as an 'early version of xxx effect' reference.
  Most routines in this demo have since been done a lot better. The music's
  the usual techno, tough not the worst tune I've ever heard. The two
  fullscreen pictures, Pixie's "Why?" and Devilstar's "Daddy Dearest", both
  competed in the graphics competition at The Party.

  Review: Heavy Metal music and lots of effects highlight this slightly
  unusual invitation intro/demo. Actually this is more like a demo with
  constantly changing effects, only with some party info overlaid, than
  anything else. This was made by Crash and Argon using their own utility
  DemoManiac, and that's the only reason I'm allowing it. Using something
  made with your own utility means you've still coded it yourself.
  Not bad, but far from great. A plus for unusual music, though.
  Ironically, Noodles won the music competition at the party he helped make
  the invitation for!

  Review: Flames and large, afterburned vector objects make up the fuzzy
  start of this intro. Next there's a grey phong torus before we finish up
  with the best routine in the intro; a goodlooking voxel terrain.
  Everything except the phong torus in "Herb!" is terribly blocky, which
  draws the overall impression down a bit... This is still a nice intro,
  but nothing of extraordinary interest.

  Review: This small demo (NO, I'm not talking about its disksize!) seems
  rushed and thrown together. It's not bad, albeit at this size perhaps a
  little short... They could have saved themselves the endpart, with the
  landscape and the sheep. It's not that pretty, and probably eats a lot of
  memory and diskspace. Still, the few effects here are reasonably good,
  with the standout one being a vector object with different rotating
  bitmaps on each side. The main tune is good, thumping techno, while the
  endtune is a little too weird for my taste. There is NO (hehe) mention in
  the demo of who made what tune, making it a little difficult for me to
  place the modules :) There's also a few OK pics by Pixie and Mount.
    The file is 2.8mb in size (unpacked), so this probably won't work on
  2mb only machines...

· Repugnance (1997, 17.06, AGA 4MB Multifile).
  code: Raylight, Chip, Scout/C-Lous (c2p), gfx: Orhan, music: Wasp.
  Winner of the Icing 97 demo competition!
  review: "Repugnance" is a power demonstration, nothing less. It's a demo
  that twists and turns, bends and swings, and all perfectly timed to the
  heavy beat of the techno soundtrack. And I don't mean that in a bad way.
  There's something a little fresh about this demo, something a little extra
  that puts it up there as one of the best demos of 1997. It's hard to pull
  out specific effects and say 'this is excellent', since it's the way it
  works together that makes it special. There's great performances on every
  level here, with the coders doing a great job, the graphician turning in
  an amazing semi-abstract fullscreen, and the musician keeping it all
  together with a heavy, dynamic tune. Recommended.

· Enforcing The Law (1997, 28.12, AGA 8MB Multifile).
  Code: Raylight, Chip, Scout/C-Lous (c2p), Gfx: Mad Druid (video clips),
  Music: Wasp. 11th in The Party 7 demo competition.
  Review: Before watching this demo, I read the accompanying text file.
  It told me that although this demo would run on my system, it would be
  slow and not very exciting, since it was optimized for 060 processors.
  There was even a requester when I ran it, saying that it would not
  perform to its best on my system. So I doubleclicked the file, not
  expecting to be impressed in any way. And I have never been happier about
  being wrong.
    "Enforcing the Law" is the second surprise from the new Swedish hope
  (well, at least in my eyes :), Powerline. It is a much more bleak, dark
  and monochrome demo than "Repugnance" was, but in some ways this actually
  works to its advantage. I don't think I've ever seen a demo in this genre
  look more 'colorful' in almost total black and white. I know I'm not
  making sense, but don't take my word for it - go see it yourself.
    But let's not forget the speed issue. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM! I watched
  the demo on an ordinary Blizzard 030-50, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
  There are some stuff in this demo that will take your breath away, even
  on a humble machine like mine :) You won't believe your eyes when you see
  that ride along the road, with voxel mountains on all sides...and that
  shiny box towards the end, wow! And that twisting, zooming pattern...was
  that an animation? The only really SLOW parts I noticed were the video
  clips, and they're not really that important to the overall effect.
    One last thing I'd like to point out about this demo is the fact that
  they're actually trying to be innovative here! When everyone else is
  doing their fire effects, these guys have come up with some incredibly
  realistic smoke! And I have never seen ANYTHING like the aforementioned
  road trip before... Powerline are the best newcomers of 1997. This demo
  comes Highly Recommended from the staff here at Scenery. Wow.

Prestige were for quite some time one of the foremost Amiga illegal
cracking groups. There were sections in Italy (selling console copiers),
France and Switzerland. They are/were also active on the PC. For review of
their cracktro done for them by Funzine, see their entry.

Prestige is dead (ROM5).
Panic left early 93, and is now independent.
Killtech left for Paranoid late 92 or early 93.

· Trainer Intro by Abyss (1995, Intro).
  Code: Dexter, Gfx: Skindiver (font), Music: Pink (The Player 6.0A format).
  Review: Slightly unusual, but not very good is this trainer intro made
  for Prodigy by Abyss. The main screen has a standard 8x8 font, and a
  dot tunnel behind the text. There's a scroller at the bottom. As you
  press the button, you're progressing through several pages of text, and
  each page is separated by the screen clapping together, then opening up
  again - from the top right and the low left. Not terribly exciting.

Professionals, The (1987-)
--------------------------
This was the group that started out a few legends... The two founders were
George (later in Subway) and J.O.E (later in a.o. Scoopex).

J.O.E (cofounder) left for the TSK Crew (88).


Profex (PFX)

FIN> Di33y (gfx music, later Dual Crew, 91), Ginky (code, 91), Jaz (code,
     91), SJ (gfx, 91), Stormbringer (code, 91), Urpex (code, 91), Wiry
     (mainorg code gfx, 91).

The most remarkable thing about Profex, I suppose, is the fact that later
celebrity musician Dizzy was once a member. I also have him listed as a
Decept member in 91...

Coltrain joined Sigma.

· Stenkil Frenkil (1991, ECS File).
  Code: Wiry, Gfx: SJ, Music: Di33y.
  Review: Nothing very remarkable about this small intro-thingy. The main
  focal point, naturally, is the stencil vectors Wiry has coded. Obviously
  inspired by Scoopex' "Mental Hangover" (where such vectors were first
  seen). Remarkably, it ran without a single hiccup.

Prologic is dead. Members joined Budbrain and Static Bytes (Playboy,
Hawkeye) 09/91. News in Anarchy's "Stolen Data #4" [08/90] that the group
was dead seem to have been greatly exaggerated :)

Survivor joined Defcon 1.

Prophets AG
-----------
???> Fred Feinbein, Mr.Magic (code, 04/88-89), Odin, TAR (stopswap, 03/89),

Prophets AG were once one of Alpha Flight's many subgroups, but left to be
an independent group in fabraury 1989. They were a German group.


Proton
------
Proton will probably only be remembered for at one time having Jester as a
member...

Pseudo-Ops were in early days most known for their 'Psudo-Ops Viruskiller',

     04/92).
MAL> Cyber Pirate (write, ex Cytax).

PMC was once a force to be reckoned with. Their coder Cocy was wellknown
following his excellent "Alfa Omega" (1991) demo, and their diskmag R.A.W
was rapidly developing into a success. However, when Cocy started coding on
a game, and the R.A.W production team joined Spaceballs, there wasn't much
left. I'd really like to know what became of their excellent musician
Peter, though :)
  1993 - At The Gathering 93, Norwegians Lord Helmet (swap edit, ex Cartel,
12/90), Kingpin (swap) and Perplex (code, 11/92, both ex Offence old) joined
Spaceballs. With the editor, co-editor and coder of "R.A.W" jumping ship,
PMC lost one of their greatest assets. Though it was claimed in Generation
#6 that Lord Helmet joined Andromeda, this is obviously untrue.

Norwegian coder Anders (ex Airborn, 04-12/92) joined Duplo. Anders was also
  sysop of 'PURE METAL LINE' until it was busted!
Norwegian graphician Ramjet (ex Cartel, 12/90-12/92) joined Spaceballs.
Thanatos (fra gfx, 09/92) and Zapper (nor music, ex Cartel, 12/90-04/92)
   both got kicked.
The French section was kicked.
Norwegian coder and musician Copernicus (Anders Hamre, ex Amiga
  Freelancers) decided to leave the scene.
Asymptotic, Fullstar, Hexogen and Rhah joined Dreamdealers because they
  were fed up with Thanatos.
Norwegian musician and swapper Dreamer (ex Amaze, early93) left the scene.
Batman, sysop 'PIECE OF HEAVEN' (05/91), got kicked.
Norwegian trader and swapper Flush (12/90-05/91) sold his Amiga and left
  the scene.
Norwegian swapper Lonerider (ex Visual Bytes) sold his Amiga, bought a PC,
  and consequently got kicked.
Norwegian graphician Fairfax (ex Beastie Boys, 11/91-12/92) joined Offence
  06/92.
The Jack (gfx, 12/90), Leatherface, Achmed B (code, 90), Dr. Feelgood (ex
  Miranda), Xion and X-Ray (nor gfx swap, ex Gate, 12/90) all got kicked.
  Dr.Feelgood left to form Obituary.

  Cartel joins... (1990, ECS File).
  code: Achmed B., gfx: The Jack, Antichrist, Ramjet, music: Zapper.
  info: The name of the demo is not accurate, but AFAIK there's no real name
  for it... It's the one where the group Cartel announces that they're
  merging into PMC! :)

· A Little Intro... (1990, late, ECS Intro).
  code: Designer, gfx: Ramjet, music: "Introtune1.4" by Zapper (ProTracker
  MOD format).
  review: Just a logo, a starfield and a scroller for Flush to send some
  messages to his contacts. Uninteresting for the rest of us.

  code: Cocy, Vanguard (math), gfx: Ramjet, The Jack (logo), X-Ray (logo),
  music: "Riff-Raff" by Zapper. Released at the Theatre & Network Party 90.
  review: An unspectacular demo from the coder team that would later make
  "Alfa Omega". Go figure! We're not given a lot of effects, there's some
  interference, some plasma and some triangle stuff that seemingly goes on
  forever. The demo has no exit, and once it's run through, it starts all
  over again. The best part: Ramjet's picture at the start.

  Review: This demo's greatest assets are clearly Ramjet's pictures;
  especially the pissed off smurf :-) Other than that, it doesn't really
  come alive for me, despite talented people working on it.

· Alfa Omega (1991, 30.06, ECS Trackmo).
  code: Cocy, Vanguard (assistant), gfx: Ramjet, music: "Garbage
  Collection" by Peter. 2nd at the Amega Party.
  review: A true classic. This demo exhibited truly advanced coding when it
  was first released, the vector animations had everyone going 'ooooh...'.
  It was something new, never done quite so good before. There's a fair few
  effects here that made Cocy a household name for a while. It was only
  beaten in the competition at the Amega party by another legendary demo;
  Tomsoft's "Virtual World".
    As a result of the faster machine I ran it on, the scrolltext at the
  bottom became increasingly out of touch with what was going on onscreen.

  Released in cooperation with New Wave (NW).
  review: The first issue of a legendary disk magazine. Graphically, it's
  not everything the later editions are. That checkerboard design doesn't
  really do it for me :) Ofcourse, from the second issue onwards we'd be
  treated to Fairfax' increasingly great art... For HD install, remember
  that the disk/assign MUST be called "R.A.W:".
    News that Walkman had joined Scoopex were, naturally, WRONG!

  Released in cooperation with New Wave (NW).
  review: The second issue of legendary mag R.A.W, and the first one with
  good graphics :) The intro (by Spaceballs) uses a RecVec type system for
  vector animation, just like in PMC's own demo "Alfa Omega". Lone Starr
  would also code the intro for R.A.W #5, the first issue released after
  the R.A.W editor joined Spaceballs.
  To install, remember that the disk/assign MUST be called "R.A.W:".

  review: A logo at the top, a logo at the bottom and a sine-scroller in
  the middle, accompanied by a mediocre techno tune. This intro was meant
  to recruit composers to a new techno music-group called BASE. I certainly
  never heard of them again, so I guess it's safe to assume it wasn't a big
  success...and neither is this intro. Nothing I'd recommend.

  review: Not much to describe here, there's a PMC logo at the top of the
  screen, the middle is occupied by some pictures (duh!) and the bottom is
  where the obligatory text writer resides. Competent enough, I guess, with
  three nice tunes and an OK logo. Anders recycled this code for a very
  similar production called "R.A.W 4½" at The Party in december!

  R.A.W: to the main directory (what would have been the root of the
  floppy). Enjoy!

        (main), Perplex (fonts), music: "We'll Make It Live" by Soul/

  review: The Andromeda intro that graces the front of the fourth issue of
  R.A.W is very nice indeed, and puts you in an expectant mood before
  plunging into the mag itself. After just two issues, they've decided to
  change the code entirely, and consequently also the design. The new
  design is perhaps cleaner, and the new code has some innovations, like
  the way you can choose how the text is formatted. However, I must say
  that I quite liked the old design :) Editorially they're as provocative
  as ever, not pulling any punches this time either.
    This would be the last issue of R.A.W released by PMC; before the next
  issue the entire editorial staff had left the group in favour of rising
  stars Spaceballs!

  review: For the coding specifics, you can just refer to the review of
  "The Gathering '92 Pictro" (04/92), since it appears to be nearly
  identical. Lazy, lazy Anders... :) The show opens with a nice picture by
  Fairfax, which is a rendition of the poster for the movie "Home Alone".
  The logo in the slideshow itself is also nice. The music is not bad, about
  par for Jester. Well, what more to say? There's no exit.

Pussy (-1991)
-------------
SWE> Bizox (ex Timex), Chunkei (swap, ex Timex), Dot (ex Timex), Dr.Yes (ex
     Timex), Eclipse (ex Timex), Izzy (ex Timex), R42 (music, ex Timex),
     Torkel (ex Timex), Tsathoggua (swap, ex Timex), Wolf (ex Timex).
???> Falch (gfx, 12/90), R24 (music, 12/90).

Pussy was a mainly Dutch group, who died in march 1991, when the group
changed their name to Jetset. I am actually uncertain whether this concerns
both the dutch and swedish members... The group's swedish division was
formed when the entire group Timex joined.

TCB joined Destiny.
Bronx Warrior joined Argon mid 91.
Swedish coder Barf (ex Timex, 12/90) left.
The French and Dutch sections left the group.
Swedes Dr.Satan (ex Timex) and Mightymuz joined Vogue.
The English section is dead; the members joined other English groups like
  Destiny, Slipstream and Magnetic Fields.

· Little Intro (1990, .12, ECS Intro).
  code: Barf, gfx: Falch, music: R24.
  Review: This little intro was released to announce that the previous
  members of Timex had now formed the Swedish division of Pussy. It's not
  much to tell the world about, but what little there is is quite
  competent. The tune's nice, as is the logo...though the coding's a little
  on the simple side. Nice enough for what it is.
    Released in 'week 51'...

Pygmy Projects (1993-, http://stekt.oulu.fi/~flame/pygmyhome/index.html)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Silver Eagle (Sami Vaarala, code, ex The Silents, 08/93-10/96).
GER> Jester (Volker Tripp, music, ex Sanity, new 02/95).

Pygmy was formed by Coconut and Flame, both ex-members of the shortlived
Finnish section of The Silents. They released one demo, "Maximum Volocity"
[08/92] for The Silents before getting kicked out. They then joined Damones,
before finally forming Pygmy. I guess we should feel lucky they tried their
hand at doing it on their own, since PP is a group that created a few quite
memorable productions! They have a special symbol, the so-called 'Pygmy
sun'. It can be seen in "Extension" (above the logo), "G-Force" (as a
gouraud object) and "Logic" (envmapped).
  1993 - Their very first demo, the trackmo "Extension" [08/93] surprised
everyone by taking the very first place in the assembly democompetition!
  1995 - The year started great for PP, after they were joined by famous
german musician Jester/Sanity in february! This move sent shockwaves
throughout the demo scene, but unfortunately it would seem like he ceased
all scene activity in favour of his professional music career shortly after
joining...

· Extension (1993, 10.08, ECS Trackmo).
  code: Coconut, Flame, gfx: Cenobit, music: "Cyberride" by Jester/Sanity
  (Pygmy Packer format). Winner of the Assembly '93 demo competition!
  review: Great in its time, Extension rocked the scene. Who would have
  expected a bunch of unknowns to come along and WIN the ASM93 demo compo?
  The show opens with a picture of a woman with a snake wrapped around her,
  while the demo loads. Once it's loaded, we get the name of the crew and
  the demo presented, in what is a rather unique style. The music is timed
  to the FX, and there's plenty of that here. Most of the effects are dot-
  or vector-based, with stuff like a dot-landscape, dot-cityscape, solid
  cityscape, dots dropping down on a vector cube, vector cube shadow-
  casting onto another vector object etc. It sort of signalled the end of
  those two trends! Well, Kefrens "Desert Dream" (04/93) had pretty much
  buried the dot stuff four months earlier, so I guess this was more of a
  twitch :)
    The music by Jester is liked by many. However, I am very individual :D
  It's frantic techno with wah-wah guitars overlayed. You've been warned.
  A file version requiring a little more memory was released in december.
  This production uses a unique music format, dubbed the Pygmy Projects
  Packer by the common conversion utilities.

  review: Wow! I'm sure THIS kicked butt in Finland! Impressive is the only
  way to describe this pioneer intro. Massive gouraud shaded objects move
  around the screen, including the infamous fish and a large face object.
  Totally oustanding. The intro was Silver Eagle's first solo project. His
  only work before this was an endpart for the TSL trackmo "Maximum
  Velocity" [08/92].
    Needs a bit of fastmem, though I do not know EXACTLY how much. Worked
  fine on my 4mb configuration.

  G Force Final (1994, .12, 020 Intro).

· Logic (1995, 13.08, AGA HD Multifile).
  code/gfx: Flame, Silver Eagle, music: "Low Voltage", "Chromosomes" and
  "Kardaaniakselli" by Paralogic System. 2nd in the Assembly '95 demo compo.
  review: Not all that impressive, this production still managed to come in
  second at ASM95...the party they won two years earlier with "Extension"
  [08/93]. The effects are perhaps better and more advanced this time
  around, but "Extension" still has the edge in pure entertainment power.
  Lots of fx, as mentioned, includes envmapping (reflection, phong),
  texturemapped tunnel, shade cluster (which Andromeda invented with their
  The Party 4 winner "Nexus 7"), texturemapped tilting cityscape, morphing
  rendered gold 'sheet', particles forming words... The music is the usual
  techno shit, no better or worse than the norm. Paralogic System is a
  separate group (or single composer, what do I know?), and not a member of
  PP.
    It seems they used a custom replayer for the music once more! Silver
  Eagle is credited with 'player' (the original Pygmy Packer was by Flame),
  and there are some files that correspond to the music names, but not to
  any known format. Any information on this is most welcome! :)
