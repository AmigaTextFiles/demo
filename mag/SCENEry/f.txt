Facet's Pussy was formed as a subgroup of Desire by Ramon B5, ThD and Sacha
from the Dutch section of Desire itself. They later recruited more members
from the mother group, like the two germans Chaos! and Kernal.

Dutchman Rotox (later known as Infant) was a member for two and a half
  years. His next group was Essence, and its probable that he changed his
  handle to Infant when he made the move.

  Winner of demo competition at Scenest 95!
  review: 4 disks are a bit hefty for this, but I assume the raytraced
  opening animation stole at least two of them. After the animation (of a
  spaceship flying through space), we're treated to a fast-paced demo with
  good-looking effects and a thumping techno soundtrack. I usually hate
  these techno things, but this one's far from the worst I have heard.
  I can see how this won a party; it's fast, fun, and looks good.
  The effects are a little on the outdated front, though - texturemapped
  cubes and stretching zoom-rotators dominate.

     it was in FLT at the time...

FLT is almost as old as the C64 scene is, and has always been one of the
'big' crews. They were formed inn 1987 by Black Shadow, who for quite some
time worked on both platforms. He was joined by the other original founder
of FLT on the C64 in february 1988, Strider. They used to be a multipurpose
group, with both cracking and demo activities. Now they have a demo
division (Virtual Dreams) to take care of that part of the operation. Also,
several of them have branched onto the PC. FLT is now basically a company,
selling console copiers and the like, but with strong scene roots. Strider
has since moved to Belgium, and then San Diego, California, USA, but I've
still got him registered in Sweden, since that's where most of his scene
activities occured.
  1990 was a year with cracks done by several guys, including veteran
Exolon, Onyx and Dave. Some cracks were even done by 'Allah from Kuwait',
but this was probably just one of the regular guys working under a
pseudonym.
  1991 - This would be the year Gaston did all the cracks. Exolon and The
Black Shadow remained on the memberlist, but did not crack anything.
Supplying was mostly handled by Splatt! and Drone No:5 (who by the end of
the year was mysteriously not on the memberlist any longer...) with the
occasional game from JBM, Luke & Chuck, Stik and Stone. Towards the end of
the year (11 or 12/91) FLATLINERS lost its WHQ status, but Pizzaman remained
on the memberlist (did he close?). The new WHQ was APOCALYPSE, sysopped by
POW (new 10/91). Among the members that came and went were Stone (supply,
08/91) and Stik (supply, 08/91). Tiger's Italian BBS ICC BBS was listed
09-10/91, but only his name and not the board 11-12/91...
  1992 - WHQ APOCALYPSE and its sysop POW (new 10/92) stepped down 05/92,
to concentrate on the PC and console scenes. Shortly after, he left the
group entirely and joined Ministry. The new WHQ became MIRAGE and its
sysop Big Boss.

The board 'BRAINDEAD' left/was kicked.
The board 'DANSE MACABRE' joined Dynamix.
Coder and cracker Tom (09-12/91) left the scene.
Swedish sysop Zike ('PLEASURE ZONE', 03/90) left.
English supplier and legendary sysop Splatt! ('SPLATTER HOUSE', 05/91-
  09/93) left the scene Christmas 1993. During his time in FLT, he left and
  rejoined three times, among others to Ministry (RAW4) and TRSI!
German Chuck changed handle to Evil Death and joined the new Angels (RAW5).
  I do not know if this is the same Chuck as the member of the 'Luke &
  Chuck' sysop team mentioned above.
Turkish Imperator joined Dynamix 93.
Deathbringer joined Zenith (RAW4).
Hotmilk (sysop) joined Panic (RAW4).
Norwegian sysop Phonebilly ('ELEGANT MACHINERY', ex The Silents, new RAW2)
  joined Crystal 09/92.
Italian sysop Highlander ('PARADISE DREAM', 05/92) joined Anthrox (RAW4).
Norwegian sysop Scratcher ('TOTAL PANIC', ex Palace, new RAW4, 10/93) soon
  joined Crusaders. This is slightly weird, since I have him verified 10/93,
  and RAW4 was published late 92...
English sysop Kitaro ('MILLENNIA', ex Alpha Flight, 05/92-09/93) joined
  2000 AD, but later left for Skid Row with a few others. It seems
  he later returned, since I have him verified in FLT 10/93...
German sysop E-605 ('BLACK SHADOW') joined United Forces.

  review: The intro opens and closes with a fish swimming across the
  screen. The graphics are functional and nice, and that goes for the
  entire intro; the unusual 8x8 pixel font is an especially nice variation.
    Other than that it's a standard style logo-plotter-scroll intro, even
  though it's nicely executed. This was the first ever intro by Fanatic.

  code: SHD (main), Duster, gfx: Brainlock (Raytrace), Doc, music: Speck
  (2x The Player 6.1A format). 7th in the Assembly 95 demo competition.
  review: H2 is a fast-paced c2p-style demo, though this one has more old
  fashioned texture mapping than phong- and envmapping. There are some nice
  routines, with an elastic tunnel ride a highlight, but most of it is a
  little blocky. Other routines worth mentioning are a moving lightsource
  shining down on a star that consequently cast a shadow, and two spacecut,
  z-buf shaded toruses. Doc's picture of a seal springing from a man's head
  and the text 'Hate 2' is the only handpixelled graphics in the demo, the
  rest is all rendered. The music shows promise as an uptempo dance demo
  tune, but ultimately lacks in punch and edge. In the end, this suffers
  from what almost all 'object' demos suffer from, a lack of soul...and the
  almost all-rendered graphics doesn't make it better. A good, alive tune
  and decent graphics can save a demo like this...but it doesn't save this
  one. The palette on the z-buffer part is way too dark. The endscroller
  can be paused with the right mouse button.
    Next year, SHD coded the amazing "Traffic" for Mystic at the Assembly.

· Nothing Special (1995, 28.12, AGA 40k Intro).
  code: P.A., PeaBrain, Loque, gfx: Jack, music: PeaBrain.
  review: I was quite astounded when viewing this intro from a group I'd
  never even heard of before, and finding it to be totally excellent!
  It opens with a convincing flame effect in a small box in the middle of
  the screen. Then the introtext is flashed in flames, before we go on to
  some fractal images waving, still in the same box.
    Next, the entire screen is used for a bouncing texturemapped cube,
  bouncing in front of and behind the animated background pillars! This
  looks very nice, and the cube is soon relieved by a more complex object.
  Next was something else I hadn't expected; a fast phong torus, with
  motionblur! It was far less commonplace with advanced routines like
  phong back in 1995. A few other, less interesting effects follow,
  including one with a picture of Al Bundy next to it, for no apparent
  reason :) Very very nice... when are these guys going to do a demo?

  review: It's the usual story, with phong objects and bumpmapping galore
  and not much else. Personally I'm getting sick of these 3D-object-
  marathon demoes. All that changes from demo to demo, it seems is the
  objects. The code remains the same, and usually the music does too.
  This is technically impressive, but not very interesting for the
  casual viewers. Perhaps it'll give some coders a hard-on, but that's
  about the extent of it. Requires some fast, though I'm not sure how much.

  review: There will be no review of this demo, for the simple fact that it
  refuses to work on my system; it gurus every time. At first I thought it
  was some program I had loaded that the demo didn't like, but booting
  without startup-sequence didn't help matters either. It always crashes
  with an 'illegal instruction' guru, ...0004 or ...0006. On closer
  inspection of the accompanying text file, I believe the problem is that
  this demo requires an FPU! Anyone with a suitable machine that can
  review this for me?
    It's a filedemo alright, but the file is almost 4MB big :) Although
  it'll work (depends on your setup ;( ) with an 020+ processor, an 040 at
  25Mhz is the recommended machine!

· Deport (1997, 05.04, AGA HD Multifile).
  code: Zig, gfx: Def, Fame, music: Revisq.
  review: Short and oh so sweet, "Deport" is filled with a few, well
  polished effects rather than lots of half finished ones, which is all too
  common. The speed of these routines are really suited to impress,
  especially the 3D lightwave scene and the speedy, greatlooking tunnels
  towards the end. Revisq's soundtrack avoids the all too common techno
  tune, in favour of a powerful percussion-based track which really adds a
  lot to the demo. Fame's graphics are OK, but nothing special.
    I do not know whether this requires any fast mem. When I clicked the
  left mouse button to exit at the end, I was presented with a guru.
  The demo was released at a small, internal meeting (dubbed the BUZ
  Party) held 04-06.97, and visited by Zig (organizer), Def, Flapjack/
  Appendix and Informer/Appendix :) Download heavily advised.

  review: Well, this ain't gonna be much of a review, since I was unable to
  run this demo on my machine. Having originally tried the demo with just
  16mb fast, and found that that just wasn't enough to get it up and
  running, I dove into this old pentium cabinet I've got here (normally
  running Red Hat Linux =]), and quickly extracted a 32mb SIMM. Plugged it
  in, tried the demo again... and now it crashed. Two more tries and I'm
  giving up. Likely this requires and FPU or possibly even PPC, but no
  system requirements are anywhere to be seen in the accompanying info file.
  I'm depressed now.

  think they could squeeze much else out of it, then. I was wrong.
    This is a one screen intro, with just a small section in the middle
  changing to accomodate the effects. There are really only two effects in
  the intro, a zoomrotator and a voxel routine, but both are well executed.
  I liked this, if nothing else then for the novelty of the music :)

Frantic is a Finland based demo group, born in may of 1990. Their first
production was released in november of the same year. There were two quite
different groups using the name Frantic, one based in Germany and one in
Finland. As the groups learned of each other, there was a cooperation
proposal, but that fell through. The two groups then went into a rivalry,
meaning harsh words were exchanged in their productions. The resolution to
this is unknown at present. As I did not intially know of this, some
information may have been placed in the wrong place.
  Their musician Captain is now a professional musician, and has even
released a CD under the name Dance Nation, called "Dawn".

  code: Macloud, gfx: E.S.P, music: "Midnight." by Technoid (4ch MOD

  review: This intro was made to announce the new Danish section of
  Frantic, and is very typical of its time. At the top of the screen is an
  ok logo, with the letters having cracks in them, like they were cast in
  stone. The rest of the screen is divided up with two small bars, and the
  action takes place between these two. Mostly it's a vector-text-vector-
  text affair, with the only diversion being the concluding straight
  greetings scroller. Not very exciting, I'm afraid. The intro has no
  exit routine whatsoever, but the text screens can be skipped with the
  right mousebutton. Almost certainly not released at a party.

  It's a lot like some of the Horizon intros of the era, actually, with a

  a sine scroller over that. It's short, easy, and looks nice.

  graphics especially stands out as worthwile. Since this is a slideshow,
  there's not much graphics to speak about.

Fresh [old] (1994-)
-------------------
Fresh was formed by large portions of the German section of Alcatraz when
they decided to kick that section.


Fresh Prince
------------
Fresh Prince was never a complete group, just one coder who happened to
not be in any group at the time. His intro 'McIntro' must surely be the
most successful non-group production ever, coming in second at the
prestigious The Party in 1994. Rebels took notice and recruited the Danish
coder just days after his success was a fact.

· Lola/McIntro (1994, 28.12, 40k Intro).
  code: Fresh Prince, Kata/Balance (replayer), gfx: n/a, music: "Muslingers"
  by Slide/Polka Brothers. 2nd in The Party 4 40k intro competition.
  review: most impressive the first time you see it, Lola/McIntro (both
  names appear in the intro) is a polished and cool effort from lone coder
  Fresh Prince. As far as I know, this is the only thing he released on his
  own. Cool music.

-------
POL> Dura (code), Metal, Saddam (gfx music).
???> Skowron (gfx, ex Absolute!, new late95).

· Prestige Cracktro (ECS Intro).
  code: Dura, gfx: Saddam (fonts), music: Von-Rays.
  review: Now, THIS is what a cracktro should look like! This generates
  vector-animations that it shows in the background, usually cogwheels and
  the like. The overall effect is very good, coupled with a palette the
  changes for each effect, and a transparent PRESTIGE logo in the bottom
  right corner. Music is an ok chippy.
    The year of release is present in the executable, but unfortunatly in
  roman numerals, which I don't know enough about to discover the real
  date... Anyway, if anyone can help, it's MCMXCV.
