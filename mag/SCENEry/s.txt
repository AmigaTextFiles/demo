Sahara Surfers (S2)
-------------------
FIN> Guru (Jarno Paananen, founder code), Stratos (founder).

Sahara Surfers were formed by Guru and Stratos from Complex. The name may
not seem immediately recognizable, but if I say that Guru/S2 is the author
of #1 module optimizer/replayer The Player and the very first amiga S3M
replayer, PS3M, then perhaps you know a little more.
  After a while S2 went more and more over to the PC, and now seems to
concentrate entirely on that platform, especially with their highly popular
MIDAS soundcard interface system. S2 now appears to be entirely dead on the
Amiga platform, though it's hard to pinpoint an exact time of death...

  review: A rather standard, boring intro; a logo on top, a scroller at the
  bottom and a text writer in the middle. Nothing interesting. One thing
  that strikes me, though. is the tune. In the samplename-message, Woober
  admits that he stole the samples from a mod by Jester. However, if you've
  heard the original mod, you can't help thinking that the samples were
  not all he stole...

     Undertakers, new winter90), Sonic 1 (gfx).
???> Killroy (gfx, 91), Rys (gfx, 91).

Sanity was born in march of 1990 by Panther (code) and Hawk (code), who
quickly took in Vindicator (music) and Cruiser (gfx) as well. Their first
production (presumably) was the musicdisk "Best Game Music Monthly #1"
[03/90], which announced the birth of the group.

Sanity was an original, all-German demo group, who achieved extensive
success after its first few releases, with classic demos like "Elysium"
[04/91].

  1990 - German musician Jester joined the group in november, after a short
stay in Red Sector Inc. The demo "Dee Groove" by Panther was released at the
Dexion Convention in december.
  1991 - Probably early in the year, the group released Jester's musicdisk
"Fool's Gold" [91], followed by the group's breakthrough demo, "Elysium"
[04/91] which came 3rd in the Amiga Convention Summit demo competition!
After this demo Chaos' coding abilities were the talk of ever

 The Fog (11/90) joined Bit Arts in the middle of the year.

  When the group eventually died, its members were scattered. The biggest
group of members, including Chaos (code, ex The Undertakers), Diddle (swap,
ex Treacl), Zaphod (swap, ex Amaze), 16 Beat (music), Jester (music, ex
Proton, new 10/90), Cthulu (gfx), Hawk (founder code), Cruiser (gfx),
Vindicator (code^music) and Panther (founder code) left to form a new
section of Rebels. They released the demo "Sanity Is Dead" under the Rebels
label to announce this. Their stay in Rebels would be a short one, however,
and soon most of these guys had formed the NEW Sanity, which also included
several ex-members of the original Sanity, like musician Bit Arts (ex Red
Sector Inc.) and coders Flosoft and Mr.Pet.

Mike D. (swap pack) joined Anarchy.
Germans Benni B. (music) and Slaxx got kicked.
Zodiac and Hi-Lite (old handle Bubbler) joined Vision Factory.

  trackmo "Mental Hangover" (04/90)! A few of the effects here bear more
  than a passing resemblance to that old classic... The rest of the effects
  are much in the vein of their own "Dee Groove" (though that had a

  review: This is completely written from memory, and from ripping the
  tunes :), so please excuse any inaccuracies. As far as I remember, I
  think there's a great music-analyzing color-'thing' :D that I liked a
  lot. That's the part that sort of stuck in my mind. And the music?
  Well, Bitarts was always one of my favorite musicians, ever since I first
  heard his tunes in the Red Sector Megademo. These are a little more
  jazzy, but very moody and absolutely great. Recommended for the music
  alone. Don't remember much of the graphics, but it's by Cougar, so how
  bad can it possibly be. If you've a machine that's specced low enough ;)
  this is about as good as you can do. Now, I'm off to hear 'Emotional
  Thing' one more time.

Sanity [new] (SNT, 1992-1996).
------------------------------
GER> Cruiser (founder gfx), Cthulhu (Jan Jessen, founder gfx), Hawk
     (Stefan, founder code), Panther (founder code), Trasher (Oliver Plink,
     swap pack 'Trashpack', ex Panic, triplememb Bomb and Artwork),
     Vindicator (founder code music), 16 Beat (Joachim Soppe, founder
     music).
FRA> Ronan (code, ex Anarchy).
ENG> Havok (gfx).

Sanity was rebuilt in 1992 by several of the original members, most of whom
were in Rebels in the meantime.

After releasing their final demo in 1995, the group fell
apart. Many of the best members left for other groups, and the few remaining
ones grew inactive. It is uncertain whether the group technically died in
1995 or 1996, my conclusion is a guess.
  The French members, musician Moby (Frederic Motte, 12/93) and graphician
Ra (both ex Dreamdealers, 08-12/93) ventured into professional careers.
Moby secured a job at Mindscape in America, and Ra opened a comic shop in
his home town in France. They both remained active on the PC scene for a
while, in the group Nooon. You'd be well advised to check out these demos!
(ROM4 some info).

  1992 - Jester contributed music to the Anarchy demo "Flower Power"
[01/92], Winner of the Digital Symposium 1992 demo competition!

  1994 - German coder Tron (ex Anarchy, 03/93-) left the group in early
december to be independent. He later reconsidered his independence, and
joined Artwork in the early days of 95. The end of december came and Chaos
released "Roots" [12/94] for The Party demo competition (with some parts by
Tron) to a disappointing 8th position.
  1995 - German musician Jester sent shockwaves through the scene when he
left Sanity for the finns in Pygmy Projects, whom he'd contributed the tune
"Cyberride" for their assembly 94-winning "Extension" [08/94] demo!
  1996 - An interesting production surfaced in the pc demo competition at
The Party 96, where Free Electronic Band (FEB) won with their demo "Alto
Knallo". The demo was coded by former Sanity members Chaos (Dierk Ohlerich)
and Mr.Pet (Peter Cukierski).

German graphician Cougar (08/93-96) first joined Artwork as a doublemember,
  but when Sanity died he became a fulltime member. He was responsible for
  many of the greatest graphics in Sanity demos, and won the graphics
  competition at The Party 93 with his fabulous "Dragonsun" picture.
German coder Zap (ex Coma, new RAW2) left to join Masque.
German musician Virgill (ex Surprise! Productions) joined TRSI.
German coder and musician Microforce (Joerg Simon, ex Coma) left the scene.
German supercoder McDeal (Karsten Weiss, ex D-Tect) only participated in
  one demo for Sanity ("Arte") before deciding to leave the scene
  altogether in late 94.
German megaswapper Exumer (Thomas Kopfmueller, ex Nuance) left the scene in
  late 94.
Editors Disney (Martin, austria, ex Alcatraz) and TFG (Niels, denmark, ex
  Majic 12) both joined to work on Sanity's planned diskmag, but when those
  plans fell through they were both unceremoniously kicked (UPS10).
Danish swapper The Pride (ex Brainstorm) and dutch swapper Kr'33 (ex Axis,
  swap pack "Femur Bundle" from Axis, new 09/92) both joined Lemon. 01/93.
The French section 'is now Ozone', according to EuroChart 15.
German musician Bit Arts (ex Sanity old) joined Complex (SLH11).
Alex, sysop of 'BASE LINE' joined Zenith (RAW4).
German coder Flosoft (Florian Stuemann) left the scene together with
  graphician Cthulhu (RAW4). Cthulu later returned, a.o. contributing
  pictures to the two "Roots" demos.
German coder Cosmos joined TRSI.
German swapper and one of the founders, Zaphod, was kicked.
German swapper and one of the founders, Diddle (Mark Vasters) left the
  scene.

  code: Chaos, gfx: Havok, music: "Optimum Fuckup" by Jester (ProTracker MOD

  review: This is essentially a 1-effect demo, demonstrating the use of
  the Optimum Fuckup effect (hence the name :D). An invention of Chaos, it
  was first seen in the selector for the Jesterday music disk. It has later
  also been used for the credits part of the World of Commodore 92 trackmo.
  However, the strength of the effect is also what brings this demo down;
  Chaos seems so pleased with it that he shows us TOO MUCH of it. The result
  is that, once the innovation wears off, it soon gets boring. Great tune by
  Jester, though.

  Review: This one's another classic, and one of the first demos to utilise
  timing of the routines to the music to great effect. Another innovation
  this brought was TOTALLY NEW effect; the socalled 'Amiga Rules' effect.
  An even better-looking one was released a few months later, in Lemon.'s
  "Announce" (1993), but this was the first.
    I won't beat around the bush any longer: This is one of my all-time
  favorite demos. Two GREAT modules from two of my fave composers, Chaos
  and Mr.Pet coding...how could it NOT be great? Nothing more to say:
  Get it! It was actually put together in five weeks when the Sanity coders
  found out about the prizes at the WOC ;)

· Interference (1993, 05.01, ECS File).
  Code: Microforce, Cosmos, Gfx: Cougar, Havok, Music: Virgill/Masque (2
  tunes in ProRunner 2.0 format).
  Review: WARNING! This review caters only for the relatively small part of
  Intereference that worked on my machine ;) It opens with the well-known
  'Orgasmatron' piccie by Cougar, a Sanity logo and an Interference logo.
  The SNT logo is OK, the Interference one mediocre. The tune is NOT good;
  it sounds like Virgill trying to do Jester. Bad move! Then, the credits
  part appears, which is nothing special. And then...it just freezes. The
  music goes into a peeeeeeeping sound, and the screen is just black.
  The acompanying text file says Interference has been tested on A500,
  A500+, A600, A1000, A1200, A2000, A3000. Perhaps they should have tried
  it on my configuration also ;D

· Terminal Fuckup (1993, 27.03, ECS File).
  Code: Tron, Gfx: Havok, Music: Jester (Promizer 1.0c format).
  3rd in the CeBIT 93 demo competition.
  Review: Yeah! The demo with ATTITUDE! This is sort-of a punkrock techno
  approach to demo making, with an increasingly in-your-face techno tune
  by Jester, that sort of reminds me of his later work in a.o. Roots.
  And that sudden ending - PISS OFF - just completes the circle.
  Nothing revolutionary here, but boy is it fun. Outstanding.

  review: Oooh, this is cute... I really like this little intro-demo!
  The effects are nothing special, just variations on cubes and such like,
  but the overall effect of the graphic and the music make it a FUN little
  production. Especially the music warrants mention, it's quite an unusual
  tune from Jester. There are no real advantages to be gained from running
  it on a faster machine; the routines are already smooth on A500's.
  Approved! Pressing the RMB during the scrolltext at the bottom reveals
  another, alternative scrolltext. This scrolltext mentions trying to find
  some of the other hidden stuff...

  review: "Arte" is a classic, what more is there to say? There's an unusal
  amount of effects, and most were quite good for their time. There's not
  much to be gained from running it on a faster machine (except for the
  endpart vectorworld), as it was designed with 68000 machines in mind, and
  the routines are already quite fast enough for that. The demo is, to a
  degree, timed to the music. There are no timing problems on faster
  machines. The endpart scroller mentions it should work on A500 to A4000,
  and I have no reason to doubt that; I've yet to come across a
  configuration it doesn't work on. And look out for the Einstein picture
  by Ra, it's AWESOME!

· Hospital Since Friday! (1993, 28.12, ECS Intro).
  code: Tron, gfx: Cougar, music: "Spice It Up" by Jester (ProTracker MOD
  format). 16th in The Party 93 demo (!) competition.
  review: This intro opens with another Motorhead cover drawn by Cougar,
  who 'broke through' with his rendition of the Orgasmatron cover,
  "Sanasmatron". Then, after a brief credits sequence we go to a relatively
  fast Doom routine, and that's it. The tune is frantic, yet with a certain
  groove and suits the demo rather well. Not a bad intro at all, but a
  little too short and small for a 60kb intro, let alone for a demo!
    If I remember the story right; Sanity couldn't finish this in time for
  the intro competition, so they stuck a few extra bits in and released it
  in the demo competition instead!

  review: I remember my original reaction to seeing this at The Party 4 was
  'lots of pretty colors, but so what?'. I had expected MUCH more from a
  quality crew like Sanity! This production IS half-baked, with time and
  missing Pet's having to take much of the blame... Get "Roots 2.0"
  instead, it's a MUCH improved version! All effects run a lot smoother on
  my 030 than they ever did on the standard A1200...

  code: Chaos, Mr.Pet, gfx: Cougar, Cthulhlu, music: "Harm Me With Harmony"
  and "Relentless Rage" by Jester (ProTracker MOD format).
  2nd in the Black Box Symposium 95 demo competition.
  review: This successor to the original "Roots" now has all the bits and
  pieces in place, and is an altogether much more polished package...
  Much has been added, and some effects have been improved since we last
  saw them. The demo is split in two parts; on AGA machines both will be
  shown, but on ECS machines only the second part appears. However, the
  demo REQUIRES an 68020 for both parts. Of course, like with the original,
  it benefits from a fast machine.
    One of Cthulhu's pictures, "Face", competed in the graphics competition
  at the same party, and came 5th.

Sardonyx was a born in 1993, as a demo group originally based in Sweden. A
small birthtro was their first production, followed by the intro "Frowzy
Frog" at The Party 93.
  1994 - More releases, including a chippack.
  1995 - At the very last day of the year, the second issue of the
controversial diskmag "Seenpoint" [12/95] was released. Group news for this
issue was that French writer TSK had joined, that Chris had to leave, that
Hype renamed to Elusive, that Maxwell joined with his board 'ANTARCTIC
STATION', that Tolpan joined with his board 'SILENT MOON', that Nadir and
Dehydrator left the group, that the Swiss section had died and that the
Norwegian section was dismissed, that Bandido renamed to Cenobite, that
B.B.King joined with 'CITY OF JOY', that Crying Freeman renamed to Luke, and
finally that Sardonyx and C-Lous will be organizing the Icing 96!
  1996 - The Icing 96 was held at the 24th to 26th of May, coorganized by
Sardonyx. Swedish coder and organizer Devotion (Christian Holmquist) left
the scene around august, after failing to finish an intro for "SeenPoint
#3".
  1997 - Norwegian graphician Zack joined Spaceballs at The Gathering 97 in
march.

German "SeenPoint" editor Fishwave (09/95-04/97) took his mag and left for
  Scoopex sometime in 1997. Presumably also swedish coder Syntax (12/93-
  05/97) and dutch writer Sane (doublememb Mellow, 11/96) came along.
Tolpan, Maxwell, Woody (code, 08/94), Drowsy, Toby, Egg, Leon and Soda had
  to leave the group due to inactivity (06/96).
Elusive (old handle Hype, 12/95) left for New Age 06/96.
Swedish swapper Cenobite (Sven Tormodsson, old handle Bandido, 12/95) left
  the scene (06/96).

  17th in the Assembly 94 40k intro competition.
  review: This intro shows some competent design-to-be, though I can't help
  but feel this would have been better as three separate crack intros than
  a single 40k'er. There's nice design, you see, but not always THE SAME
  design. One part looks like this, another like this. Each on it's own is
  not bad, but they were never meant for each other, see?
    The best part is without a doubt the DPaint plasma!

  review: Before you start listening, take a few moments out to listen to
  The Loop's "Icy Melodies". Hmmmmmm...... just beautiful.... Where was I?
  Oh yeah, this was supposed to be a diskmag review :) Done a few of these
  in my time, and I can't help but feel that this mag has everything going
  for it - audiovisual talent from the very top of the charts, and good
  code. I've never really been a fan of its aggressive editorial style,
  however, but history tells the clearest of all stories, and it's doubtless
  that RAW became the number one mag of its time through the same kind of
  tactics. Provocation - but I still feel that in Lord Helmet's case it was
  always with a wink of an eye, and tongue firmly in cheek. Fishwave seems
  more cynical - like he means every word. But then again, perhaps it's just
  me, what do I know, I'm just a poor reviewer... =)
    This was TSK's first issue as a staff writer. Over half of the mag
  consists of philosphical rambling from Fishwave, which is less than
  interesting to me. I care about the truth, not how Fishwave feels about
  the truth. And frankly, his 'why should I respect the people who created
  the scene' opinions provoke me. What I most miss in this mag is the DEMO
  related material, the stuff that made ROM so great - the story behind top
  demos, f.ex. This issue presents four interviews, with SMT/Artwork
  (clearing up the misunderstandings that led to a negative article in the
  first issue), Enzo/Hellfire (sysop of 'SKY TOWER'), Data/Oxygene and TSK
  himself. No information is provided on the system requirements of
  SeenPoint, but I assume that it won't be a problem on any bog standard
  A1200. The mag does not multitask.

  information: Originally to have been released in june, but massively

  version could be released, someone who wasn't supposed to got their hands
  on it and spread it to aminet without the authorization of its authors :(

  "Wah Experience" by Revisq/Anadune, "SeenPoint Theme" by Laxical/Scoopex,
  editor: Fishwave (main), Alhazred, Sane.
  review: The same main code and graphics from the previous issues were
  again used for this one - though the mag multitasks now! Music is still
  ok, but not exceptional. Pretty standard, calm magtunes. Then onto the
  problems: Fishwave. OK, this guy is getting on my nerves. His editorial
  style (the made-up story of how the Three Little Elks travel with a time
  machine to Mekka Symposium 99 to steal Azure's routines from the future is
  a particular negative highpoint) is just rambling, spiked with his own
  down-putting comments spat our right, left and center. The mag itself -
  the code, the graphics, the music - is very good, but GOD why couldn't we
  have gotten a different editor? Sorry Fishwave, but you brought it onto
  yourself. This issue looks good, sounds good, but is ultimately most of
  all just pathetic.

  positive attention in some weird way :) You see, "Chiptunes 1" succeeds
  in the one single field where it is most important for any music related
  software to succeed: with the music. Hunz delivers tunes here that are
  well above the levels of mediocracy displayed by some of his
  contemporaries in the field. In short, these are good chippies!
    The tunes presented are "Just Right", "Count To Zero", "Flower Pot",
  "Fry An Egg", "Grind", "Happy Laugh", "Monarchy Riot II", "Nothing To

Scandal [old] (1992-)
---------------------
???> Nero (swe? modem).

Scandal was built late 92 by half the members of the former Grace Italy.

D.P.L. joined Platin.

---------------------
GER> Melvin (swap, 94).
???> Cujo (crackorg), Defjam (crackorg), Gandalf (demoorg), Paragon
     (demoorg), Scandal (founder mainorg).

Scandal is an illegal group, formed early 94 (probably) when the two groups
Faith (ami and console) and Progress (ami) joined forces under this label.
They were joined by Dynasty on the pc, to serve as their pc section.


Scarlet
-------
Bazifus joined Vogue mid 91.


Sceptic (1991-)
---------------
GER> Can (ex Iris), Flite (gfx music, 92-93), Mike (sysop 'GLOBAL CHAOS',

AUT> Imagic (sysop 'FIRE AND ICE', ex 2000 AD).

Boards; HIGH DENSITY (ger, previously PUMP ACTION), BAD RELIGION (usa),
     HIGHLANDER (aut), DREAMLAND (10/96).

After being Madhouse Ware for a short amount of time, the group changed its
name to Sceptic (often spellt with a dollar sign, "$ceptic") mid 91.
  Famous German musician Pink/Abyss was a double member for a short while
back in 1994. Sceptic's most known demo related productions are without a
doubt the classic "Chipmania"'s! Freedom Crack #11 carried the news that
'Celtic and Laurance joined with 'FIRE AND ICE'', but a later source
clearly explain that the sysop of said board is Imagic! They did a great
looking trainer intro for Supplex, with fab graphics by Flite!

German Loomex joined Byte Busters.
French musician Hydra (ex Devils) left to be independent.
Crunchy and Fuszy (coders amiga+pc sysops 'THE FACTORY') joined TEK.

  code: Wigwam, Hydra (fix), gfx: Flite (font, logo), music: "Hulk Hulk by

  review: The top of the screen has a very pink D&R logo, then the rest is
  occupied with a space with wobbly wireframe vectors in the background,
  over which is laid a pretty standard textplotter. The music is an annoying
  chiptune. The bottom right contains a tiny 'Sceptic' signature, to tell
  the world who made the intro.
    The version reviewed seems to be a presentation of the intro, with
  nonsense board adds and saying cracked by xxx, supplied by yyy etc., so it
  was almost certainly not used on a crack. Destabilizes my system.

Additional members were mentioned in the "Megademo", but these were C64-
only. Swedish coder and cracker Syncro (09/89-02/90), also the coder behind
the utility "Syncro-Packer", left for Phenomena around mid 90.

· Megademo (1989, .09, ECS Megademo).
  code: Syncro, gfx: Syncro, CDC, music: Danko/Fairlight (loader, parts 3,
  4 and 6), Vicious/MP (parts 1, 2) and Megaforce (part 5).
  review: These guys came from the C64, and it shows. Most of the 6 parts
  in this megademo have a very typical C64-look. This fortunately results
  in very competent design (for the period), since these guys obviously
  were among the better on the 64. I suppose the megademo form was a
  natural choice for C64 people that migrated to the Amiga, since it's
  very similar to the 64 demos of the time. They were used to the 'press
  space bar for next part' demos.
    The music is mostly very good, with four excellent tunes by Danko/FLT.
  There's also two by Vicious/Mp, which are less great :), and a fabulous
  tune from Megaforce. This one's ripped, and some of you may remember it
  from another golden oldie, Dexion's "Megademo". Especially noteworthy is
  the fact that this old production works on my 030-50 without even the
  slightest hint of trouble!

  FEELING of the thing... Perhaps it's the absolutely stunning music? :)
  Anyway, this feels good...and that's all the reason I need to recommend
  it, really! Oh yeah, and it's based around vectorbobs and a chessboard,

    The music is ripped from the game "Onslaught", which they openly admit.

Scoopex was formed by Ranger when Megaforce died in 1988, and their origins
lie in Austria. They have since grown to be one of the best international
demo and cracking crews, and was perhaps the first group where the two
activities were successfully integrated.
  1988 - Only one confirmed release from this year, the demo "Glory Stars",
but more were probably made - we will certainly investigae =)
  1989 - A swedish division joined this year, consisting of Panther (code),
Jesus (music), Merriman (code), Zwullo (code) and Eddie (gfx). Their first
release for the group was the one-screen demo "Big" [89]. The members all
faded away in time, and a new swedish division was later born in late 1990.
It is possible that at least Jesus, Eddie and Panther were later together in
Surprise! Productions. Austrian coder Crazy Typer (ex Megaforce, 08/89) left
the scene late in the year. He coded the "J.O.E Slideshow 2" [08/89] for
Scoopex. The entire Share and Enjoy (SAE) joined as a subgroup, but was
kicked after a couple of months, allegedly due to 'lameness'. Most members
of the group would ofcourse later form the core of Anarchy, which became the
most successful British group ever...
  1990 - April of this year brought what has perhaps become the most
important demo ever - "Mental Hangover" [04/90]. Clearly the Demo of the
Year, it made instant superstars of its finnish creators; coder Slayer,
graphician Reward and musician Uncle Tom were all catapulted towards the top
of the charts. Around the middle of the year (perhaps may?) two Australian
members, Bigot20 and Syntech, were kicked. The Australian section was then
re-strengthened when The Corporal and The Teacher joined from Rebels. Then
all English members left to form Genesis with former members of Oracle.
Their German board 'HIGH SOCIETY' was closed toweards the end of the year.
In november, Slayer released the follow-up demo "Chromium" [11/90] at the
Halloween party in sweden. This was to become his last demo ever, and he
left the scene after its release. Despite recurring rumours of his return to
the scene, it never happened, and he left the group he'd been in since 1989.
After contributing a picture to Slayer's "Chromium" [11/90] demo in
november, swedish top graphician Uno/Phenomena took Photon, Judas and Invid
with him to Scoopex a month later. Musician Uncle Tom (Tomas Dahlgren) also
rejoined from Razor 1911 in december, but unfortunately he slowly faded away
from the scene, and never contributed to another production (though a few of
his old tunes were used in productions upto 1992). Perhaps his greatest
legacy to the scene - and a piece of music that will forever echo in the
minds of amiga demo lovers everywhere - is his fantastic "Madness Took Me"
from "Mental Hangover" [04/90]. Lowtec left to join Angels late in the year.
  1991 - This year signified a big change, when original organizer Ranger
(Peter, also sysop 'WORLD OF WODKA') stepped down, and a new man was put in
charge: Austrian sysop Trade ('NO RESPECT'). He would hold this position
until 1994. A new Swedish division joined this year.
  1992 - This was a poor year for demo production in Scoopex. Only two items
were produced, "Seen Before" and "It's Tricky" [08/92], the latter done by
their subgroup Surprise! Productions (S!P). This group - previously holding
a similar position in TRSI - were all kicked after half a year, with the
sole exception of coder Spycatcher, who was adopted to the native group.
Swedish coder Protec (ex Photon/Phenomena, new 12/90) left the scene to code
games early in the year. His sole contribution to the group was the
announcement intro "Stunner Dentro" [91], as far as we can see.
  1994 - In 1994 Trade stepped down as leader of the group, and turned the
leadership over to another Austrian; coder Antibyte. He has not yet been
replaced. Norwegian graphician Absurd (ex Suspiria, 04/94) joined Stone Arts
and was there 12/94, but rejoined soon after (ROM4). Mr.King released some
issues of the 'Nevermind' packmag (#48 early 94). A pc section was formed,
and at least a small dentro called "Forbidden Areas" (07/94) was released.
featuring the graphical talents of Made.
  1995 - This year marks a sort of 'new beginning' for Scoopex, after
organizing was taken over by Antibyte. He initiated a major cleanup,
reducing the amount of members from over 100 to a more normal 20 active
people. Inactive old legends like Slayer and Uncle Tom were also axed
from the memberlist.
  1996 - The two musicians Oxbow (Anouari Stephane, france, 12/94) and Deck
(Juuso Salmijarvi, finland, 12/94-02/96) moved over to the PC section 11/96.
They both still seem to be producing music for Amiga releases, though, such
as for "Zero-G III" [08/97], "GOSH" [10/97], "Torque" [02/98] and "Abduction
98 Invitation" [04/98].
  1997 - During the late part of 1997, Scoopex released winner after winner,
nearly earning themselves the kind of status they had in the early 90's!
French coder Krishna joined around the middle of the year, to replace Ninja
in France. As far as I can see, his only release for Scoopex was the 64k
intro "Performance" [07/97] at Wired 97. Danish coder Vention joined late
97/early 98. I have placed him in Denmark, even though he now resides in
Norway. After leaving to work for Funcom in 1994, he later helped form the
Norwegian gamemaking company Innerloop. This company also feature other ex-
FunCom scene celebrities, including a small man called Lone Starr! The
company is now worth somewhere between 70 and 80 million norwegian
kroner...so don't come to us saying coding demos won't pay you any money!!

Germans Marc (music) and JCS (gfx) joined Syndrome. Another source claims
  JCS joined Abyss 10/96, but he only did so as a doublememb.
Motion (Anders Lundholm, den) and TNT left 10/96. Motion was the guy behind
  the "Show Reel" wild demo, which won at The Party 5.
Kris joined Clique 06/96.
Not content with his impeccable slideshow "Artcore" (07/95), French
  graphician Made (early 94-07/95) left for Bomb!
Norwegians Benjamin (old handle Phoenix, ex Suspiria) and Vegard (music, ex

Norwegian graphician and swapper Snuffy (ex Cadaver) left to be independent
  05/95.
Finnish coder Stelios (ex Complex) joined, and then left for CNCD within a
  matter of days.
Defcat and Spycatcher joined TRSI.
Link (ex Dual Crew) and Parallax joined BASF.
German swapper and graphician Plasma (Lee Wijant, ex Vision) got kicked due
  to inactivity late 94.
Swedes Colorbird (code, ex Noxious), Some1 and Prime (both music, all new
  early 93) left to form Circle.
Norwegians Decker (gfx) and Jaz joined Andromeda, sometime between 04 and
  12/93.
Snow and Rofoe joined Logic late 93.
Dutch coder Vortex (92) left for Jetset early93.
American sysops Voyager and Snow Queen ('FASTTRAX' WHQ) left early 93.
The board  'KIWILAND' was kicked.
American sysop Rock Head ('DISC SHOPPE'/'DISK SHOP', 08/92) was kicked.
Swiss sysop Necronom ('ECTOPLAZM', early93) closed his board forever, and
  therefore presumably left the scene?
Coder Tech (12/92) left the scene in the early part of 93. While he
  contributed code to the "SCX-NRG-MTU 40k Intro" [93], the invitation intro
  to that party, mentions he has left the scene (in hidden text).
ZigZag (sysop 'MAY DAY', ex Crack Inc) joined TRSI.
Ecstasy rejoined Phantasm.
Slash and Inspector joined Accession.
Swedish trader and sysop Hof ('FAR OUT', 08/92) joined Fairlight.
Winger (ex Alpha Flight, new 09/92) joined, but soon left for Crystal.
American sysop Planet Master ('THE EDGE', 08/92) left for The Silents to be
  their new WHQ.
Swedish sysop Kevin Key ('FLASHBACK', ex Vision, 10/92) quickly moved on to
  join Anthrox.
Germans Autopsy (editor 'World Charts, 92) and Angeldawn (gfx, both ex
  Model, 12/92) both left to join The Silents in early 1993. Several other
  sources refer to strange things, like the two of them joining Anthrox
  and Angeldawn changing his handle to Godflesh.
Norwegian swapper Zob (08/92) left the scene.
Norwegian swapper and musician Rancor joined Absolute!
Jean joined Absolute, says Sledgehammer #11, but Jean was NEVER in Scoopex;
  He's in Surprise! Productions, their previous subgroup.
American sysop Freddy Krueger ('THE BOILER ROOM', 05/90-08/92) joined
  Complex.
German sysop Andy ('DINKELATORS PALACE', 10/91) joined Spreadpoint late 91.
Legendary finnish graphician Reward (new late 89) joined Complex in late 91
  or early 92. Reward worked on lots of demos, such as the boundarybreaking
  "Mental Hangover" [04/90].
Finnish sysop Zebra (sysop 'THE ZOO', 07/91-08/92) joined Damones late 92.
Dutch sysops Candyman (ex Energy, new mid 91) and Optimize ('BAGHDAD CAFE')
  both joined Mirage late 91.
Norwegians Flash and Mindblaster (both ex Dual Crew) joined Vision.
Tiger (ex Model) left the scene.
French graphician Mack (ex Alliance Design, new mid 91) joined Melon Dezign.
Coder and trainer Black Cat (92) joined Anthrox (pre 07/92).
American sysop The Bulldog ('BULLDOG'S FRIENDS') left. That board is
  probably identical to 'FLYING DUTCHMAN', just with a different name and
  prefix (they share the last 7 digits).
German sysop Bomber ('PEARL HARBOUR', ex Crusaders, 10-12/91) left, and soon
  after joined Byte Busters.
Swedish sysop Wico ('FAR OUT' earlier 'INNER CIRCLE') joined from Razor
  1911 old, but soon went on to Rebels.
Norwegians Jawbreaker (code), Pal (gfx, both ex Razor 1911 old) and Perplex
  (code), founders of the Norwegian branch, all left to form Offence. This
  led to the death of the initial Norwegian division, but a new one was
  later formed.
Kamenski (swi? 03/90) joined Crystal.
English cracker N.O.M.A.D (ex Slipstream, 07/90) left to join Crystal.
Austrian graphician J.O.E (ex TSK, new summer 89-08/89) left the scene for a
  while, only to return as a member of TRSI later. Other sources claim he
  left for Surprise! Productions.

  review: This intro is very blue... =) It uses just the middle 3/4ths of
  the screen, and occupies them with a nice logo, some text underneath it
  and a sinescroller - the kind that also twists - overlaid on top of it
  all. Amusingly, the first words in the scroller are 'ANOTHER UNREADABLE
  SCROLL FROM SCOOPEX' =) Nice oldskool chiptune from a classic game.
  The scroller credits everything but code, except to say 'intro by Scoopex
  france'. Anyone from Scoopex who remember this, and can help us out here?
    The version reviewed is from their release of Executioner playable
  preview (supplied by Rat, no cracker credited...but it was probably not
  copy protected). No date is supplied, but THE BOILER ROOM was still WHQ,
  at least, so it's 92 or earlier...I'd guess around 91.

· Big (1989, ECS File).
  code: Panther, Merriman, gfx: Eddie, music: "Xeqtion-Scoopex Swe" by Jesus
  and Titan/Northstar (4ch SoundTracker format).
  review: "Big" was the first release from the Swedish Division that had
  just joined. It features a large grey SCOOPEX logo scrolling around the
  middle part of the screen, with a BIG linevector logo spinning over it.
  The bottom of the screen features a plain, blue-tinted scroller and four
  lines at the top of the screen echo the music. It's typical of its time,
  and there are millions of one-screen demos like this. The right
  mousebutton switches the lo-pass audio filter (and the powerled) on or
  off, and the joystick button can be used to freeze the scroller. Titan/
  Northstar later became Uncle Tom/Scoopex.
    The demo will work provided you run it with KillAGA, but it does
  destabilize your system after execution.

  Winner of the Swedish Elite Easter conference demo competition!
  info: Amazing demo that changed the way we look at the demoscene forever.
  Professional in every respect, it made instant superstars of its makers -
  especially coder Slayer. This was the first ever trackmo, and set
  standards that echoed throughout all subsequent demos. Perhaps the most
  important demo ever, and an obvious "Demo of the Year" here in Scenery.
    The demo originally on worked on OCS/ECS machines, though an AGA fix was
  eventually released to AmiNet.

  review: Angeldawn's graphics are the first thing that grabs me about WC5.
  I've always been a fan, his stuff has that little extra edge... The second
  thing you'll notice is the fact that it's controlled not by the mouse, but
  with the keyboard! Cursor keys and return guide you around the different
  menus, and tell you what crackers and releases were the best and worst in
  the early days of 1992 :) WC5 is adequate, but not terribly outstanding.
  They promise a new outfir for the next issue, which they also delivered. I
  do miss some more precise credits and some more text!
    Despite using KillAGA there are some graphical strangeness around...but
  the charts are fully usable, as well as readable.

  review: This rather old chart features stunning graphics (for its time)
  and one of Uncle Tom's all-time greatest tunes. It's really a shame he
  left the scene; if he was making stuff like this in '92, god knows what
  he could have come up with today! Anyway, this features mostly crack-
  and modem-related charts, so interest for legal-minded people might be
  low. Worth getting just for the tune. On the 030 AGA machine, the music
  routine doesn't play correctly.

  review: As far as invitation intros go, this is hardly the most advanced
  one seen. After an introductory sequence with a little text and some
  logos, a morphing text plotter appears. It's ok, and does what it's
  supposed to, but there's nothing extraordinary.
    Depacking the file and hex-reading it reveals a text message from the
  coder, Antibyte. Cheer up, man! The party was held at easter time, so
  this intro was presumably released in the first part of 1993. There is no
  credit given for the Manitou logo.

· Pha Q - Lameness Took Me (1993, ECS Multifile).
  code: Antibyte, gfx: Mack, J.O.E., Uno, Made, music: Hi-Lite, Fred.
  review: The only reason why you might want this is a couple of logos (the
  bootlogo and Made's end logo), and not much else. I never found it very
  interesting, since it's so AVERAGE. Music and coding fails to excite me.
  Though it's multifile, it still requires the custom bootblock to boot.
    It has a hidden part, which you can access if you look on the disk's
  directory. One the files is the one to execute. If you wonder about the
  name, then try to say it very slowly - it should sound like FUCK YOU.

· Maxima (1993, early, ECS File).
  code: Flasher Jack, gfx: Acid, Uno (logo), CPT, music: "Occasions of Sin"
  by Hi-Lite (FC-M format).
  review: The demo opens with a good Scoopex logo by Acid. The next cool
  thing on display (after some vector letters fly from right to left) is a
  large SCX logo made out of vectors...which updates terribly jerky on my
  030-50 :( Hmmm... Is this realtime? I think not. The cheats of yesterday
  to make things seem like they run faster than they do are the downfalls
  of today, when they run at a fraction of the speed they could!
    Another nice part has a sphere increasing and decreasing in size, until
  it sort of 'spacecuts' a great pixeled Scoopex logo by Uno! Also the
  good, fast shade bobs of the end part are worth a mention. Unfortunately,
  the demo cannot be exited, and you have to reboot every time you've
  watched it.
    Overall, "Maxima" leaves me with a very good feeling. This is a
  nice little demo with some really excellent artwork and music. There's
  some reasonably good pixels here, and the 'comeback' Scoopex logo by Uno
  is rather cool. The credits part still had some graphical errors on my
  setup, even with KillAGA running. Uno and CPT are mentioned as 'guest
  artists'. The demo requires ½mb chip and ½mb fast to work.

  review: Mostly dot-effects are presented here, with dots morphing to form
  letters, dot-cubes, a circlescroller in dots and lots and lots of dot-
  balls. The only break from the dots, it seems, is the starwars scroller
  presented towards the end of the intro. This has some graphical errors on
  the 030 machine, probably because of the faster processor (ran with
  KillAGA, so the graphics shouldn't be a problem). Nothing outstanding.

· 666 Intro: Don't Forget The Sign (1995, autumn, ECS Intro).
  code: Dr.Feelgood, gfx: Made, music: Oxbow.
  review: Rather fun, this, though it gets a bit monotonous after a while.
  It opens with a typical 'Melon' design, only to suddenly transform into a
  heavy-metal hell with screeching guitars and suitable design. There's
  text that appears on screen in time to the music, but - at least on my
  machine - it sometimes moves so fast it's impossible to read. Then we're
  on to some more Melon-y design for the end part with a vertical scroller
  that can be stopped with the right mousebutton. Fun, but forgettable.

  code: Antibyte, gfx: Made, Absurd, music: Laxical (The Player 6.1A

  review: Graphics and sound are the best things about ALIEN - a demo that
  has no logical links to its name. The show opens with an excellent
  Scoopex logo by Made, with some text zooming in and out over it. Then the
  "Alien" logo appears, which is of a much lesser quality. Next we're given
  some effects, like a cube which has zoomrotators of an eye texturemapped
  onto them - moving independently of each other! This is a nice effect, as
  is the morphing skull. The gouraud stuff here seems a little premature
  and blocky - like the early gouraud in Razor 1911's "Falu Red Color"
  intro. The standard filled vectors here are much better. Overall, I'd say
  you'd want to get this for the graphics and music - not for the code.
    The picture 'Braindamage' by Absurd, which appears halfway through the
  demo, seems distorted. I also had a crashing experience with the 4mb fast
  setup, though what caused it is uncertain. "Alien" will work on an
  unexpanded A1200, but an accelerator is recommended. "Alien 2" (12/98) was
  released in 1998, and won The Party 98 demo competition.

· Artcore (1995, 14.07, AGA Multifile Slideshow).
  code: Psy, gfx: Made, music: Oxbow (The Player 6.1A format).
  review: Ok, this blew me away. From a very acceptable introduction
  sequence, with an ok logo and a 'beating heart' soundtrack, you're shown
  the excellent title picture. Then, you get to the selector. And *WHAT* a
  selector! It's actually a Doom clone, and you travel around the dungeons
  searching for pictures! Ofcourse, there's an autoslide button to be
  pushed in the room you begin in... This selector method is both good and
  bad. Obviously, it looks great! The drawback, however, is that with all
  the wall textures pretty much identical, you get lost all too easily.
  An overlayed map function would have helped tredemendously, but then
  again - this is a slideshow and not a commercial game! Ok, over to the
  main focal point of any slideshow - graphics. Made's pictures here can
  only be described in one word - outstanding! When you travel around, and
  find a picture, you see its name in a small status box, and the
  resolution and numbers of colors used on the right. I was actually
  astonished to find that most of these pictures were in 64 or, in some
  cases, as little as 32 colors! I was only able to find one 256 color
  picture here... One major drawback with many of Made's pictures is the
  fact that they're copies of pictures that's even been done before...and
  in many cases better. He's asking for trouble when he's trying to top
  Fade One's rendition of the girl and the antilope (?) in the water, that
  he did in his slideshow "Never Liked Uno". Needless to say, Fade One's
  the superior here. Anyway, this has to be my longest review ever!
  Conclusion: Totally fucking outstanding. Download. Oh, and the music's
  excellent! --Note-- Wandering aimlessly, I suddenly found a 'secret
  area', but before I could find anything interesting, I also discovered
  that pressing both mouse buttons at the same time exits the demo :(
  There is also a chiptune called 'Artcore-Hidden' on my Mods Anthology CD,
  so there's a more than fair chance there's actually a hidden part.
  Will work on unexpanded A1200s.

· Iso (1995, 08.10, AGA Trackmo, 2 disks).
  code: Ninja, gfx: Made/Bomb, Ender (intro raytrace), music: Oxbow.
  3rd in the Remedy 95 demo competition.
  review: A BIG demo from the French guys, who were unfortunately beaten by
  two Swedish groups at a Swedish party. That's a long way to travel for
  the bitter taste of defeat... Anyway, this demo is above average in
  every respect. When you boot the first disk, you're shown some
  information about your system, like processor and memory available.
  When the loading is complete, the demo itself starts with a raytraced
  animation, with the names of the creators flashing up at regular
  intervals. The demo itself consists of LOTS of good, advanced effects.
  The music by Oxbow is the usual techno, except for the endtune which is a
  funk tune, much in the style of what Moby did for Sanity's "Arte" (1993).
  The endpart is quite interesting in itself, really, with its amazingly
  smooth plain vectors flying around in the background. The upscroller can
  be paused with the right mousebutton, though the demo does not mention it.
    There's also several great pictures by Made here, but then you'd pretty
  much expect him to make great pictures, wouldn't you? The demo recognizes
  a second disk drive (and a third, for all I know :), so there's no
  annoying diskswap pauses. Booting the second disk brings up a small
  graphical display informing us it's the second disk. This was Ninja's
  first release for Scoopex. Will work on unexpanded A1200's.
    With harddrives now the standard, this was perhaps the LAST great
  trackmo, and the end of an era? At the Assembly summer party the
  following year, a sequel was presented, called "Cyberia - Iso Opus II".
  It was a harddisk demo, and nowhere near as good as this one.

  code: Antibyte, gfx: Uno, music: "Caacaophoniahappo" by Deck (The Player
  6.1A format). 11th in The Party 5 40k intro competition.
  review: Pretty much a standard 2-effect intro this, the only possible
  innovation being the phong-shading. It's not - by far - the best routine
  of its type, but not the worst either. The intro opens with a reasonably
  cool picture by Uno, of a mean-looking eye and a Scoopex logo. Then the
  phong routine is introduced, and we're given a donut with a star inside,
  plus a duck. Then we're given a zoomrotated, stretching version of the
  eye from the intro. Then there's a rather pointless effect, a tunnel of
  pink and light blue circles, before we're given one last look at the pic.
  The music is monotonous and not very exciting. Still, it's far better
  than the irritating piece he did for the sequel, "Zero-G 2"! I found an
  error message for reporting 'not enough memory', but none for AGA.
  Therefore, I'm refraining from categorizing this as either an ECS or
  AGA intro. Runs on unexpanded A1200's.

  review: Disappointment. That's the word I'd use to describe the follow-up
  to the excellent "Iso" (10/95) trackmo! It seems they've lost the touch
  that Iso had, and have instead come up with a an advanced, but bland and
  boring demo. The effects may be harder to code, but that doesn't
  automatically make them cooler to look at! This is a horror example of a
  demo with no identity of its own, just effects linked one after the
  other... This is not what I expect from a 2.8mb (archived) HD demo from
  Ninja and Made!
    There are two full-screen pictures by Made in this demo, the second one
  being "Babylona", which won the graphics competition at this very party.
  The musician, Doft, delivers a bland and uninteresting tune. It's like
  he's trying to sound like Deck (who sounds awful in his own right) - and
  fails...

  and Made had they NOT made this emberassing intro. The only one who gets
  out of this one with some credibility is Finnish musician Deck, whose
  involvement can surely have been no more than their just using his tune.
  This looks just awful and jerks like hell even on my 030. Requires a

  2nd in The Party 6 40k intro competition.
  review: This intro is good in parts, and less so in others. The stars of
  the show are some more shaded objects, this time with the 'innovation'
  that there's some animated (precalced?) object in the background also.
  The music gets on your nerves after a while, and Made's graphics limit
  themselves to a mediocre font. The competition must have been abysmal.

  Winner of the Wired 97 64k intro competition!
  review: Despite being a party winner, there is really little to this one-
  effect intro. Everything is based around Krishna's envmap routine, from
  the opening SCOOPEX logo to the names of the three authors to the title of
  the intro. Then follows two mediocre objects, and finally a bird object
  with quite a lot of polygons...and then nothing. Probably extremely well
  coded, but oh so dull... The music quickly gets very tedious and
  monotonous. The info file mentions the intro will NOT work on 040 or 060
  cards! Why?

  code: Antibyte, Boogeyman, gfx: Tactica, music: Deck (The Player 6.1A

  review: Some more amazing morphing, large envmapped objects and scenes
  from the coding facory Antibyte (with some help from Boogeyman) here. The
  most impressive thing about his intros seem to be that it's so damn FAST -
  everything just runs sooo smoothly! The 3d scene with the castle is
  nothing less than amazing on an 030. And it ends with bumpmapped credits
  and a really cool effect where a scoopex logo is backlit...you've seen it
  many times in the movies etc... Even Deck's music is tolerable here! :)
    You can use the commandline parameter '0' for 1x2 resolution, which
  further boosts the speed of the intro.

  Laxical, Oxbow, Deck.
  review: Gosh features 30 chiptunes from three musicians, and a full-blown
  techno tune from a fourth. Couple this with LOTS of pictures by Absurd,
  and you've got yourself a slideshow/demo/musicdisk/chippack hybrid!
  There's nothing much wrong with any of the audiovisuals here, with lots
  of good quality Absurd pictures, as mentioned, lots of tunes to choose
  from and a fast envmapping routine to spin the name of the current
  composer on top of eaach picture...
    News dated 11/96 stated that Oxbow and Deck had moved over to the PC
  section of Scoopex, but it seems they got homesick :) The final picture
  by Absurd was used in the packmenu 'Nam Nam' as early as 1994...
  The release date is based on the upload date to AmiNet :)
    You can use the commandline parameter '0' to make all the env-mapped
  objects run in 1x1 mode, which it tells you AFTER you've run it once.
  A sneaky way to make you run it twice ;) Though the demo will run on a
  standard 020 with 4mb fast, it recommends a 030 or better.

· Superautodrome (1997, 28.12, AGA 40k Intro).
  code: Antibyte, gfx: Nomad (3d), music: Muffler.
  Winner of The Party 97 40k intro competition!
  review: 3D worlds, with texture, phong and envmapping abound in Scoopex'
  TP97 winner this year. Technically, I guess this is one of the best
  40k'ers ever, but visually it's less than great in my eyes. All the 3d
  trickery is well and nice, but it's not very exciting anymore, is it?
  There's virtually no interesting design, the music sux, and there's no
  real graphics here either. If you love objects and camera angles, then
  go get this - otherwise, you'd probably be better off looking elsewhere.
    The intro is a little slow on the 030, unless you use the commandline
  switch '0' to swtich on 1x2 resolution, which helps a lot. The version
  reviewed here was released to aminet a few days after the competition,
  and had three bugs fixed. However, there's still some bugs left in the
  opening 'phong in a globe' part...

· 5977 (1997, 28.12, AGA Slideshow).
  code: Antibyte, gfx: Lazur, music: Jogeir. Released at The Party 7.
  review: Lazur's first release for Scoopex is his third (!) slideshow - a
  remarkable release in many respects. All of the pictures here (except
  what's tailormade for this production) seem to be from 1996, which means
  two things. One; he's a damned workaholic, and two; there's a whole year
  of pictures still unreleased! The mind boggles at the possibilities...
    The pictures here vary somewhat in quality, from the awesome "Elmore"
  to some more bland, uninspired works ("Tears"...). Most, if not all, of
  these pictures have been used in other productions, but that's almost
  always the case with all slideshow these days, so it's no real deterrent.
  One thing that seem to constantly annoy me about Lazur's work is that
  he's still having problems with proportions of bodies, though. The other
  very remarkable thing about this slide show is THE RETURN OF JOGEIR! It's
  been a few years since this living legend did any music for the Amiga
  scene, and his return is warmly welcomed! His tune here is pretty good,
  but not excellent - perhaps he's a bit rusty on 4ch work, hehe...
    The slideshow opens and closes with an animation of a man walking,
  before finding a book, and opening it. You choose what picture to view
  by pointing the index finger of his hand at the picture, and at the end
  he drops the book to the ground. The slideshow will actually work on an
  unexpanded A1200, but without 4MB of fastmem, there won't be any intro
  and end animations.

  Shade's opening logo is very cool, and the textures throughout the intro
  are also among the better ones produced! This is excellent, what more can

    There are two command line options, specifying the optional use of a
  lesser resolution (1x2) and a fast mapper for 020/030 machines.

  review: And just when we thought the limit had been reached for 40k'ers,
  Antibyte had to be the one to crush our illusions. This is not good. This
  is not even great. This is just plain fucking AWESOME! Bringing some
  extra people on board was apparently just what the doctor ordered, and
  after a disappointing introduction with some more of those pentagrams
  that Antibyte has been so fond of lately, this just takes off. From the
  beautifully rendered scenes to the excellent bumpmapping to the original
  fractal distortion, this is a beauty. Rubberduck contributes a
  "chaosrotating" routine.
    Just like with "Torque" [02/98], this also has two commandline
  parameters, doing exactly what they did in that one.

  review: We haven't heard anything from Psy in a while, but here he's back
  with a snappy, little invitation intro for the Abduction Party. This
  intro rests most heavily on the graphics, though, and Made doesn't
  disappoint. The pictures here are actually rather unusual for him,
  because they're a lot more artistic than what he usually does, but by all
  means we're not disappointed here ;) Deck's music will quickly exhaust
  your ears; it's a weird mixture of funk and standard Deck'y squals and
  squeeks! The release date is no way certain; it is based upon the
  datestamps on the files themselves.

  Raze/Nah-Kolor, editor: Fishwave.
  review: The mag opens with a nice, surreal title picture, before going
  directly to the reading matter. Eracore is a good graphician, but he has
  certainly done a lot better work than the panel for this mag. The four
  tunes offer more than enough distracting sound. The main problem with SP,
  as I see it, lies more in the content of the articles than anything else.
  It just doesn't have the quality articlewriters that ROM had, not that
  little something special that made those mags so interesting and readable.
  And besides, Fishwave seems to have a general negative attitude, that
  makes the reading experience more of an irritant than an inspiration.
  Bay Tremore's title picture is "Sweet Vibraphone" (with a Seenpoint logo
  added), which he competed with at the Assembly 97, but which was unplaced.
  the mag announces Krishna as Ninja's replacement in France, something that
  happened LOOONG ago.
    Seenpoint should work on unexpanded A1200's, but some fastmem is
  recommended. Naturally the mag multitasks.

  code: Antibyte, Optima, Deetsay (musicsystem), gfx: Acryl, music: Deetsay.
  Winner of The Party 98 40k intro competition!
  review: Antibyte (this time with the help of Optima) crowns the title for
  the best 40k intro of the year, "1000%" is amazing! I can't begin to
  explain the excellence on display here - the technical prowess of this
  intro is just amazing. There is both 3d scenes and 2d effects, all looking
  excellent, and thanks to Deetsay's music system (which precalculates its
  samples) - and his composing abilities - there is three fabulous tunes
  within this intro! There has never been a more excellent 40k intro, or one
  featuring as much effects and music as this! The praise just doesn't
  end... :) Oh and for an excellent bonus, the final tune is a cover version
  of Tip and Mantronix' classic "Musiklinjen" from Phenomena's "Enigma"
  [03/91] demo!
    The version reviewed is the REAL (compo) version, and not the early one
  uploaded to ftp.amigascne.org by accident - which had a bug in its memory
  allocation routine. The intro works on any 020 AGA amiga with 4MB fast,
  but the producers recommend at least 030-50 for speed, and preferably
  060-50. It supports the usual command line parameter '0' for 1x2
  resolution, recommended for speed on 030 machines.

  code: Boogeyman, Metal Designer, Antibyte, gfx: Acryl, Nomad, music:
  Muffler, Virgill. Winner of The Party 98 demo competition!
  review: A demo that tries in its story-line to evoke the feeling that the
  original Alien movies created. It does this in a 3d environment, looking
  much like a standard "storytelling" demo. It features characters from the
  movies, battling aliens aboard a spaceship... There is occasional effects
  between the story parts every now and then, and these all have a high
  degree of quality, especially the flashing tunnell towards the end of the
  second file, which reminded me a lot of the one in The Black Lotus'
  classic "Captured Dreams" (though that was clearly superior). The 3d
  routine used seems good, though not with a lot of bells and whistles, but
  it moves a little slow on my machine. The demo will work on any 020 AGA
  amiga (with at least 16mb fast), but the producers strongly recommend an
  060 processor. I agree.
    The only returning production member from the original "Alien" (06/95)
  is Antibyte, but the demo does seem to benefit from the new crew, as it is
  much better than the original. The entire demo is presented in an area
  smaller than the actual screen, a little wider than it is high. The demo
  is comprised of 7 files, the script that starts the other files, four
  main parts, fadein and fadout. The decrunch and waiting time between the
  parts is too long. This is certainly one of the largest (in size) amiga
  demos ever, the LHA file is 6.8 MB big... Lots of textures, we expect!
    The version reviewed was downloaded from the Scoopex homepage, and is
  reportedly the same as the compo version plus the endpart - which wasn't
  shown at The Party due to the limitation of 6MB harddisk usage. They say
  to look for the final version, coming soon, but since this demo is from
  1998 and it was downloaded by me in mid 2000, I expect there won't ever be
  one... Virgill is not credited in the demo, presumably because his tune
  appears in the endpart (sounds a lot more like him than the others), and
  that wasn't shown in the competition.

  review: I'd just like to start this by uttering a small "wow". This demo
  opens on a great note - and even though it moves like through syrup on my
  machine, the opening "Tomb Raider"-like dungeon still impresses. As
  mentioned, we're in a dungeon and a man with a torch walks towards the
  cave walls, where the letters "SCL" are inscribed. Until now all we've
  heard is the man's footfalls, but now the first bars of the music starts
  as some envmapped shapes appear in the dungeon. Then we're shown the
  utterly cool "Artifictional" logo by Influence! Next we're back in a new
  dungeon of sorts, now with water flowing through it. Credits for the demo
  appears in waterfalls, though the one for coding is kinda hard to see...
  Anyway, we move around in the dungeon some more before we finally arrive
  at a wooden boat. The camera zooms in on its mast, which forms a crucific.
  The 3d part is over, and we are on to a sort of greetings part. This one
  is also very nicely done, with two bands forming two a circles, and with
  the names of groups written across the bands as they spin. Inside the two
  circles an object forming the word RESPECT spins. The demo goes on for a
  little while longer, with more shapes, 3d scenes and objects, but nothing
  really outstanding appears after this. Overall this is a pretty good demo,
  with some technical niceties. I guess the rest of the MS demos were really
  outstanding, since this came as low as 8th...
    When I first tried this, it crashed on me just after the 'respect' part,
  but rebooting with no startup-sequence and running the demo as the first
  thing worked much better, and the second try went without a glitch! =)
  System requirements are really modest, just AGA 020+ and 16MB of RAM, but
  given how this moves on my 030-50 I guess the real system demands for
  smooth execution is somewhere closer to 040.

· Synergy (1997, 30.03, AGA 6MB Demo).
  code: NoName, gfx: JCS, music: Marc (Tracker Packer format).
  Winner of the SILIConvention 97 demo competition!
  review: "Synergy" opens splendidly, wih a very cool raytraced animation
  set to some pretty groovy music! The music is timed to the onscreen
  action, but not slavishly, more like it changes mood as the effects
  change. The palette is very well put together, making all effects look
  their best, from tunnels to bumpmaps. Another impressive instance is where
  a picture is brought out of focus by wgat seems


  amiga ripples

  animation of shark in clouds.

    The version reviewed is version 1.1, released 9.4-97.

· Reflexity (1998, 08.08, AGA ?MB File Demo).
  code: NoName, gfx: JCS, Anneke (cow), music: CDK.
  Winner of the Belgian Scene Event 98 demo competition!
  review: Fast and smooth action are on offer in S7's impressive but short
  "Reflexity". It lasts for no longer than a minute and a half, but in that
  time delivers some striking images, especially perhaps the raytraced anim
  of a tree with sun reflecting off and through its leaves as it spins! On
  the other hand, we speculate that this is what is eating most of the
  diskspace =) Though we can appreciate the humor, we do feel some of the
  professional mood is destroyed by new funmember Anneke (a girlfriend of
  one of the makers, we assume?)'s BSE cow. Don't ask. JCS' fabulous
  fullscreen picture is "Spacegirls", which he won the graphics competition
  at the same party with.
    The version reviewed was tagged *FINAL*, do not know what differences
  there are to the party version... The accompanying text files mention the
  demo has been tested on 030-50,
  040-25 and 060-50, so it should be compatibly with all accelerators.

Session was formed by Cesium after he left Balance in search of more
friendship. He brought his board 'OMAHA THUNDER' with him to the new group,
but when he had to leave for the army the board was finally closed.
Swedes Crusader and Candyman are not only brothers, they're actually twins!

A major setback was suffered when some of the important members left for
  Endzeit 06/98. They were the swedes E-Moon (org code, 05-07/96), Blaze
  (code, ex Insane, new 04-06/96) and Psycho (music, 05/96).
Norwegian main organizer Terrox (Kent-Rune Saetrum, gfx music swap sysop
  'TOTAL REFILL') left the scene 12/96. The organizer job was handed down
  to Cesium, who is still in the army. Therefore Session is run these days
  by E-Moon.
Dutch coder and sysop Infant ('THE HIDEOUT', ex Essence, new 12/95-07/96)
  was headhunted to New Age, but soon left for Nah Kolor, where he only

  for Session. After staying just one week in Nah Kolor, he rejooined
  Session, and released an intro for them just before The Party 6.
  He has now left again, and these days he's a member of Subspace, Kinky

  2nd in the Icing 96 64k intro competition.
  review: It opens with two good logos, the last of which has a bump-map
  effect on it. Next we travel through a tunnel. After that, we're on to
  a blue torus with a blue background with a variable diffusion. After that
  it's more of the same with a shaded torus and two shaded rock-like
  objects travelling around. It's an OK intro but nothing that will set the
  world on fire.

  review: Wipe? Perhaps 'Bump' would be a better name, since two out of
  three effects in this intro are of that variety. There's no drawn
  graphics, and the music is of the usual variety for this kind of thing.
  Technically competent, but doesn't excite.

  3rd in The Summer Party 1996 40k intro competition.
  review: This small 3-hour production has all its chunky routines
  presented in that annoying 'ghosted' look. Apparently a few of the
  countless c2p converters out there generate these... Anyway, I don't like
  it - solid effects look better any day of the week. Ok, what we have here
  are a couple of shaded objects, a little bump-mapping and that's it.
  Neither the graphics nor the music impresses. The objects can be paused
  with the right mouse button. Requires 2mb (1mb enough?) fast.

Setrox (1989-1990)
------------------
???> Dave, Zork.

Boards; 4th DIMENSION (usa), BAD BOY CLUB (usa), LIVING DEAD (usa),
     INNERSPACE (swi), THE LINE TO HEAVEN (swi).

Setrox was formed in the beginning of 1989 as a merger between two smaller
Swiss groups, Senses and Atrox. They were a mainly illegal group,
concentrating on trainers. During the summer of 1989, they were in
discussions with Brainstorm about cooperation on the diskmag that was to
become "Zine", but eventually decided against taking part in the project
because they doubted Brainstorm's talents. Their coder The Accused, who DID
believe in the project, left for Brainstorm to continue working with the
mag.
  1990 - Two new members joined around march, from the death of Headwave.
However, the group died around 05/90. Swiss members Moses (trade, 11/89) and
Cortez (code, old handle Laser, 11/89) left for Alcatraz; Zyr (code, 11/89)
has started working on a game, and will likely end his scene involvement.
Swiss Pioneer (swap trade, 11/89) will join a new French group, built by
members of Paranoimia and others (can anyone identify this group?)

German sysop Empire ('BORDERLINE') joined Awesome.
Condor, P001, Sigma and Divine left to form a new Swiss group due to some
  internal, personal problems in the group, probably around 11/89.

· Der Brockhaus (1989, 21.11, ECS File).
  code: Zyr, Cortez (additional), gfx: Straesse, Ebu (sprites), music:
  "Agony" by Megatron.
  review: This nicely done little demo features a line-vector scroller as
  its main effect, though it does for that effect what Angels' "Copper
  Master" did to copper demos - kills it dead by doing everything anyone has
  ever done with it, plus a few tricks of its own. The scrollers can
  sometimes be a little hard to read. Nice minimalist design.

------
???> Wildstyle (gfx, 08/93).


Shadows, The
------------
The Shadows are dead. The best members in both Germany and Denmark joined
Next in the middle of 1991. There is probably no relation to the Norwegian
C64 group of the same name.
  1991 - Dr.Ghoul joined Defcon 1 mid 91.


Shamrock (1993-)
----------------
NOR> Ace (founder, ex Devils), Darkdude (ex Majic 12, new RAW6), Icarus (ex
     Gollum), Niggerjack (Stian Myhre, code, ex Gollum, later Donut
     Fetish), Peavey (founder, ex Devils), Shade (Anders Haakens, founder
     swap, ex Devils).

Shamrock was formed by Ace, Peavy, Redferne, Shade and Optic when they all
left Devils. It was a primarily Norwegian only group.

Norwegian cofounder and musician Referne (ex Devils) joined Stone Arts.
Norwegian cofounder Optic (ex Devils) joined Banana Dezign.


Share and Enjoy (SAE, 1987-1992)
--------------------------------
SAE was formed in 1987 by Comrade J, and within 3 years had about 30 members
and had joined Megaforce (which shortly became Scoopex) as a subgroup. Their
life as a Scoopex subgroup was short - because of conflicting interests (SAE
wanted to do demos, SCX wanted originals and cracks), they left the group
and continued on their own (though Scoopex claim they were kicked). The
group died around 1991 - 92 after their last major demo, "Impossible
Playfields" [10/90], since all the group's coders found work that took up
all their time. Several members also joined Anarchy.
  There were three SAE copy/demo parties in the summers of 1988, 1989 and
1990, but information on these are scarce at this time. We are wowking on
securing more information on these events.
  Comrade J (Jolyon Ralph) now runs the web company Mysterious Ways in
Croydon, UK, where also TiW is an employee. Del now works as a programmer
for Codemasters. The Judge (Jolyon Myers) made some tunes for amiga games
(Shadow Dancer etc.) under the name JVM Design, and now works at Eidos. Jon
works at Psygnosis, as does Rogue Male - as a musician. Anarchy found work
outside the scene. Strangly, the group still seems to have a web presence,
if you look at http://www.shareandenjoy.org, though the original members do
not know who claims to be in the group today.

PS. There were SAE copy/demo parties held in Summer 1988, 1989 and (finally)
1990. They were all held in Croydon, UK.

  Amazing Tunes II (Musicdisk).
  review: According to a discussion on alt.sys.amiga.demos in 10/94, the
  original version has dodgy coding that makes it unstable on almost
  anything but a standard A500. However, the version Comrade J made for one
  of Almathera's CD's should work better.

Musician Organic (04-12/92) joined Fairlight.
Daryl (ex Spreadpoint) and Shaggy (ex Majic 12, old handle Guran) were both
  kicked. Daryl joined the new Paradox.

· Trainer Intro (ECS Intro).
  code: Maniac, gfx: Iridon (logo), music: "Mental Madness" by Mel O'Dee
  (ProTracker MOD format).
  review: A nice, standard trainer intro - an OK logo on top of the screen,
  and the rest occupied by text. The text (trainer options mostly) is filled
  with raster colors for a nicer effect, and after a small while a LARGE
  sine-scroller (nearly fullscreen!) comes across the screen, on top of
  everything else. Not the worst trainer intro in the world, quite nice.
  The music is typical Mel O'Dee happy-happy chip.
    Reviewed from the version of the intro released with the Cyber Cop/

· Technomania '91 (1991, .08, Trackloaded musicdisk).

  review: Trashcan's musicdisk is dubbed here 'The First Ever Techno Music-
  Disk'. I don't know if that is true, but who cares. These guys came over
  from the glory lands of the C64, and it shows. The design is so
  unmistakably C64, it almost hurts your eyes. Am I saying it's not good?
  If I am, I would be lying. I like the design, really, it sort of gives
  you a feeling of the good old days. ahhh... Well, this is a musicdisk, so
  on to the important stuff: Any good, is it? Well, I hate techno
  personally, so I guess I shouldn't really be judging this... But as far
  as this sort of music goes, I guess I've heard lots worse. Approved.
    There is mention in the scrolltext that the loader will not work
  on turbo Amigas, but it would seem ECR is wrong :) I had absolutely no
  problems, it loaded and ran without a glitch. For those who want to rip
  the modules for themselves, that's not too much of a problem here. They
  are all in unpacked form on the disk, so all you have to do is load and
  search. Couldn't be easier.

  review: Ohh, it's a scrolltext-effect-scrolltext demo! That was a trend
  that we had a lot during the early trackmo days, before the megademo
  enthusiasts had warmed to the concept of the trackmo. A lot of the early
  trackmos were megademos with continuous music, really. Anyway, on to this
  one! The C64 influences are still showing, but to a lesser extent. They
  have abandoned most of it for the 'mediocre Amiga group' style. Naturally
  the coder boasts that his routines are over a year old, blah blah blah.
  We really don't care how old they are, as long as they're good. Anyway,
  this trackmo is competent, with some routines that are bad and some that
  are OK.
    It crashed on my machine during the endpart's bonus part :) It also
  announces Technomania 3 'soon', which means there must have been a #2!

Shining 8 were reborn as a cracking group, and released quite a few CD rips
and other stuff. At the end of 1995, after an argument between the two
leaders, with the leader Satan, lots of members joined Scoopex. With this,
Shining 8 finally died for good on the amiga.

· A Pile of Shit (1995, AGA 40k Intro).
  6th in the Somewhere in Holland 95 intro competition.
  review: This one opens with a very cool tilting zoomrotator thing on a
  very colorful pattern. This is really good. It continues with a
  voxelspace routine followed by a true tunnel routine. It the concludes
  with a dose of LemmingDoom and a LemmingMapped cube.
    This intro clearly shows us that here we have a good coder, but without
  the graphics and music support he deserves. This guy (whoever he may be)
  needs to get himself a musician and a painter to work with. Therefore my
  conclusion would be - code cool, gfx & mus sux :)
  No credits appear anywhere in the intro.

???> Rascal (code crack, 95), Secrefice (sysop 'HALLUCINATIVE COMA', 95).

With the release of "Shocked?" (05/95), the germans Spin (code), Aerosoul
(gfx) and Dreamer (music) left Shoot. Spin and Dreamer (dRm) joined Abyss
late 95. Rascal codes keymakers and was also in lots of other groups in 95.

  Doom's Day 94 Slideshow (1994, 08.10, Slideshow).
  info: The release date assumes it was released ON the party.

· Shocked? (1995, 21.05, 40k Intro).
  code: Spin, gfx: Glue (picture), Aerosoul (font), music: Dreamer.
  Contribution for the Nexuus 95 40k intro competition.
  review: I don't know, there are things here that are just fine, and some
  things that aint so hot, but... It just doesn't come together to make me
  feel good. The only exception is at the very end, when the music reaches
  its crescendo, then quiets down almost completely and the text 'Shoot!
  Somewhere on a higher mental plane' is shown, that's cool. Other than
  that, there are a couple of nice effects based on the basic interference
  idea that are OK.
    With this intro, Spin, Aerosoul and Dreamer left Shoot.

· 60k of Zwidula (1995, 22.04, AGA 40k Intro).
  code: Sart, PVC, gfx: Ben.E, music: Shamrock.
  3rd in the Black Box Symposium 95 64k intro competition.
  review: Why on earth these people have given an intro that's less than
  40k in size a name like that is not something I comprehend. This is still
  a nicely put together intro, with the opening logo and end rabbit by
  Ben.E the saving graces. People were pretty bored with dot-tunnels and
  vector cubes even back in 1995, guys.

The Silents is one of the oldest groups in the scene, and one whose members
have since had the most success as game developers. The games all started in
1992, when a selection from the Swedish division released the game Pinball
Dreams through 21st Century Entertainment. They called themselves Digital
Illusions, and consisted of Animal (coordinator), Goofy & SinCos (coders),
Chevron (gfx), and Blaizer (music). It is unclear whether they're still
involved with the scene in any way, but I guess at least Animal is still
organizing TSL...? DI followed the success with several games, including
Pinball Fantasies, Benefactor and Pinball Illusions.
  Another story is that of the danes The Spy (code, ex Crionics, new RAW3),
Mikael Balle (gfx, 11/89-04/91) and Jesper Kyd (music, 11/89-04/91). These
guys also worked on several game projects after retiring from the scene,
most of them for consoles. Details on exactly WHAT games they worked on are
a little sketchy, but I'll see what I can find out ;) I have recently
revealed they're now based in America. Rizzo was the first scener to openly
admit (in R.A.W #2) that he had been infected with the HIV virus.
  1987 - The Silents were Born on the amiga. Their first production was
released in october, called "Welcome On Amiga".
  1989 - Disky left the scene in november.
  1991 - The active part of the french group Concept, Performer (code), NHP
(music), BKH (music), Rookie and Ronan (code) joined together with fellow
frenchmen Motif (code), Zoom (gfx) and Walt (gfx) to form a french section.
Their first production was "BBS Intro" [91], quickly followed by the trackmo
"Ice" [06/91] and "Intro? Dentro? Mentro? Demo?" [08/91]. After that
release, Walt and Motif left for Alliance Design, and the rest of TSL france
(Audiomonster, Conquest (ex Next), NHP and BKH, Performer, Ronan, Rookie,
Surfer (ex next) and Zoom (ex Next)) joined Anarchy. Audiomonster returned
after a few days, but later left for Melon Dezign. The Norwegian section was
formed in november. TMB (gfx) joined after just one month in Kefrens, due to
the bad internal organizing and being accused of digitizing his graphics!
  1992 - Joker close his board and left the scene early92. Norwegian
graphician TMB Designs (ex Kefrens, new 11/91-) left for Spaceballs at The
Party 92 in december.
  1993 - Swedish coders Spirou and Cuddley joined from Aurora sometime
between january and may. Talented swedes Lizardking (music) and Tony (gfx,
both ex Alcatraz) left to help form the new Razor 1911 in december.
  1995 - Swedish coder Delery joined Freezers late 95.

German "World Charts" editor Autopsy (ex Scoopex, 04/93) took WC with him
  and joined Hoodlum. It seems strange if Angeldawn didn't come with him...
German trader Secret was later in Crystal.
Swedish coder Ted (ex Top Swap) joined Defjam.
Dutch sysop Camelot ('CHAOS', 91) joined Submission.
French organizer and trade Rave (ex TRSI) left the Amiga for the PC scene.
German coder Tedric (ex Paradise, new 05/92) joined DCS.
Italians Case (music) and Filippetto (code music) both later wound up in
  Ram Jam.
Danish graphician Devilstar (12/93) joined the new Kefrens, then moved on to
  Virtual Dreams.
Germans WOTW (music, 04/93) and D-Sign (gfx, both ex Dual Crew) left to join
  Essence.
Finns Coconut and Flame (both ex Fantasy Force) joined Damones.
  The two were partly responsible for the "Maximum Velocity" [08/92]
  trackmo, and members of relatively shortlived Finnish section.
French swapper Wizz (ex Delight, new early92) was kicked, and therefore
  joined Digital.
Sacha rejoined Desire.
Englishman Fobia was kicked due to inactivity.
Swedish graphician Butch (ex Palace, 05/93) joined Scoopex.
Crime, Pioneer and Survivor joined Adept. Other sources claim they joined
  Addonic, and that Crime Pioneer is one person...
Englishman Polo changed his handle to Mark and joined LSD.
Dutchmen 911 (03/92), Astro (both new RAW3) and Mark joined Rebels.
Norwegian coder Nosferatu (Geir Are Skjeret, ex Razor 1911), who joined
  04/92, right after The Gathering, left to do his military service.
Norwegian Bug (Stein Erik Giske, ex Razor 1911, new 04/92) was never a
  member, according to R.A.W #4. His continued scene life seems uncertain.
The Silents kicked all Norwegian, Finnish, English and several other
  members.
Zephyr, sysop 'SOMEWHERE IN TIME' got kicked, and joined Shining.
Norwegian musician Jason (ex Kefrens, new 04/92) joined Crusaders.
Frenchmen Alex (gfx, ex Alcatraz) and Nam (code) joined Dreamdealers and
  formed their own subgroup, Oops! Production.
Frenchmen Hof (gfx, ex Atlantys, 04/92) and Xann (ex Willow) joined Movement
  in the beginning of 1993 because Hof felt his work was not being used in
  TSL. A little later, it was announced in 'Eternal #2' that Xann had never
  been a member of Movement...
German subgroup No-Soul Produkktions (NSP) - Foxx, Lynxx (both ex Panic),
  Bass and Barock - all left late 92 to be a group in their own right.
  This seems a little strange, as the German bbs 'FOXX'S DEN' is mentioned
  as a TSL BBS in "World Charts #9" (04/93), but perhaps they all left a
  small while later.
Circulator (sysop 'VIRTUAL REALITY' opened late92) joined 2000 AD or
  Supplex... Info conflicts here!
The American board 'PRIME TIME' (10/92), 'will join' Alcatraz. It was once
  the group's WHQ.
Shade and Sigma joined Alcatraz. Are any of these - or both - the sysop of
  'PRIME TIME'? Miracle's "Eternal #2" claimed Shade had joined DCS, but I
  can not confirm this.
French musician Audiomonster (04/92) joined Melon Dezign.
Danish coder T-Bone (ex Dexion, new late91) sold his Amiga and left the
  scene.
Kevin Key (sysop 'INSIDE TREATMENT', ex Noxious) left for Vision.
Belgian trader and sysop Dr.Doolittle ('MOLDAVIA', ex Spreadpoint, new
  06/90-04/91) and Lyzanxia (code) were kicked early 92! Lyzanxia co-coded
  the bbs intro "Moldavia".
Frenchmen Daryl and Rave (both ex TRSI) joined, but Daryl was later kicked
  because Audiomonster didn't like his ways. Daryl then joined Spreadpoint.
Jake left.
American sysop Sycon ('TERMINAL DISASTER', 91) left. This board was their
  WHQ in "Global Trash" [04/91], and was also mentioned in "BBS Intro" [91].
Swedish sysop Regent ('CRIME ZONE', 91) left to be independent.
The Norwegian division lost most members; Rob and Timewalker joined Offence
  (both later rejoined), while Phonebilly (sysop 'ELEGANT MACHINERY')
  joined Fairlight.
Danish coder Sunjohn (04/91) joined Anarchy. Sunjohn coded one of the best
  ever TSL demos, "Global Trash" [04/91]!
Frenchman Rasputin left the scene late 91, or joined Zenith late 91, as
  claimed in "Freedom Crack #8". Other sources indicate he joined Anarchy.
Swedish swappers Myfo and Lando (ex Mythos, both new 04/91) got kicked.
  Lando joined Skid Row mid 91.

  review: Not very advanced, with just a logo in the wellknown 'Psygnosis'
  style, and a wireframe vector scroller that twists and turns in every
  direction. Not very inspiring, most interesting for the people who worked
  on it - most of what would later be Digital Illusions ;D

  review: This is a very well presented little demo (well, more of an intro
  really...) This is mainly due to some excellent visuals by Mikael Balle,
  which were incidentally also used in their "Megademo"! The demo itself
  focuses on a dotscroll (a new idea by Mr.Perfect they claim...was this the
  very first dotscroller?) with the usual twists and turns. The obligatory
  logo at the top of the screen changes between 5 images; SILENTS - MR
  PERFECT - MIKAEL BALLE - JESPER KYD and a Batman logo :) Nice.

  code: Sunjohn, gfx: Mikael Balle, Sionic (titlepic), music: "Intro

  by Jesper Kyd.
  Winner of the Amiga Convention Summit demo competition!
  review: This demo is legendary, and rightly so. Sunjohn's first (and as
  far as I know, only) TSL demo creates a mood not unlike Kyd and Balle's
  masterpiece "Hardwired", released at the end of the year. Jesper Kyd's
  music plays a big part in that, and the idea to have music playing almost
  instantly after you insert the disk is a very good one. Being used to
  things loading for a while, you're actually startled when you insert
  this and it starts right away!
    So, what's the star feature of GT? The code? The graphics? The music?
  The answer is a combination. First things first; the code here consists
  mostly of nicely executed vector routines (and animation replayers ;),
  most of which are pretty good. The vectors here are perhaps not
  revolutionary, but at least Sunjohn brought in some new elements, like
  the flashing sections which hadn't been seen before. The graphics are
  also good, with nice design, great raytraced animations and a fabulous
  fullscreen logo by Sionic. And I believe I mentioned the music above?
    Sionic remains something of a mystery. He came out of nowhere (a 'new'
  member, as mentioned in the demo) with the fabulous fullscreen logo in
  this demo, only to never be heard from again as far as I know. Weird.
  The intro and end music is in normal ProTracker format, while the main
  tune is packed with NoisePacker...

  code: Performer (main), Motif (dots), gfx: Walt, music: "Enigma Year NHP-
  BKH" by NHP and BKH (EUREKA Packer format).
  review: This demo is actually a first class example of the old 'text
  screen - effect - text screen' formula, but retains qualities that set it
  apart from most others in this genre. Being a demo from 1991, it's hardly
  surprising that the effects are of the 'filled vector object' variety.
  Having said that, these are among the best filled/glenz objects on the
  Amiga as far as pure smoothness goes.
    What takes this from an average example of an extinct demo type to a
  great one, is the quality of the material. Walt's logos and fonts are
  quite outstanding, and are way ahead of their time. Both of these logos
  deserve places in the 'demoscene logo hall of fame', if such a thing is
  ever invented :) The music is a nice, smooth affair but ultimately quite
  forgettable. Get this for the outstanding graphics and design.
    This was probably the French sections' last demo before "Goodbye",

  Winner of the Abstract - Oxygen summerparty 1992 demo competition!
  info: These people all later ended up in Pygmy Projects. This was the
  first and only demo ever released by the Finnish section. It was supposed
  to be released at The Assembly, but due to a problem with the trackloader
  it crashed after the opening animation. It was released a few weeks later,
  at a small swedish party, and won the democompetition there!
    Thanks to Coconut for information.

  review: Not much to shout about, everything about "Enjoy" is definitely
  middle-of-the road. There's simply nothing to GET EXCITED about here, and
  therefore the demo leaves you WITHOUT wanting more :) Not good.
    Remarkably, it works without a glitch (except for some music hiccups)
  on the 030, indicating a clean programming style on Rayban's part. It's a
  pity that's the only thing to recommend the demo :( This was definitely
  released AFTER "Static Chaos", since the demo is mentioned within.

  code: Thomas/Spreadpoint, gfx: Angeldawn, music: WOTW, editor: Autopsy.
  review: This was the first release of 'WC' for The Silents, and the
  second issue I ever saw. This edition does not differ much at all from
  issue #6, released for Scoopex. The code does not seem significantly
  changed, and most of the graphics are the same, save for a new Silents
  logo by Angeldawn. There are now a staggering 7 chiptunes to choose from,
  of which the default one seems to be the best. It does borrow some chords
  and melodies from Jarre, though...
    Not much more to say, really. A nice, professional release aimed at the
  crack/train/trade section of the scene. Works shamelessly well, and
  without a single hiccup on my machine.

  code: Crush, Ricky, gfx: Dize, John Doe, music: "Fruitkitchen..sco" by

  review: Fruitkitchen is certainly one of the best demos TSL have
  delivered in recent years! It's absolutely brimming with goodlooking
  effects and nice graphics. And don't even get me started on Scortia's
  excellent soundtrack! It opens with some pretty impressive green tinted
  voxels, where there are some objects added to the landscape here and
  there. Overlaid on this we're given the credits. The next effect is
  almost the most impressive one in the entire demo - it's a vector cube
  with a difference! Imagine the cube as the disco ball from Andromeda's
  "Nexus 7" with lights shooting out of every side, and all the sides have
  animated, spinning eye textures mapped onto them! Add this to the fact
  that the cube is spinning and in and out of the screen, and you've got
  yourself a showstopper! Just amazing. The next effect's not much worse,
  with us flying through streets a night, and with really realistic looking
  street lights shining at us. Then, when you're in heaven and think things
  can't get any better, a fast doom routine appears! This one's got
  everything expcept height, and looks really good for 1995!
    Next up are some vector objects, each one disintegrating to reaveal
  another inside, before we're shown three gouraud shaded objects mirrored
  onto a solid graphic sphere. We end up with a standard vector routine,
  with many objects moving around independently.
    Together with great graphics and music, this is a truly great demo if
  ever I saw one. It's great to see The Silents back in shape! The demo is
  subtitled 'A Journey Into The Banana Incident'. They mention that Blood
  Kitchen will be next in the Kitchen series, but as far as I know that
  never materialized. The last ever TSL demo?

  vectors. This last part is quite nice, with three individual objects
  travelling in a circle. Nice choice of palette. Very very nice.

  review: Nothing really spectacular about Ressurrection; it's a humorous
  picture, a scroller across the bottom and a tune. It was meant more as a
  'sign of life' than a real production anyway, so I guess they just wanted
  to release something. Some text suggest more issues of Ressurrection are
  on their way! Does it require AGA? I don't know... It caused a software
  failure and a guru after exiting on my system, but the intro itself ran
  fine.

This group will probably be best remembered for housing some of the people
who would later build the wellknown Absolute! The SOC in Soc.Brigade means
'Snap Off Commies', just for the record. They are also probably one of (if
not the first!) Amiga group to have a PC section which won the demo
competition at the first official Hungarian demo party in 1991 (Twin
Sectors Inc. party) with "Torso".
  When the group died, the best members (ADT, Ben...) formed Absolute!

Comiga joined Cerberos.
Petroff sold his Amiga, but will continue making music on his PC early 92.

Sodan is legendary Danish coder Sören Grönbech's one-man crew. Sodan was
BIG on the C64, where he among other things invented the socalled 'tech-
tech' method of "waving" pictures more than 8 pixels to either side. When
he started coding on the Amiga, one of the first things he did was re-
invent the routine that made him immortal. He also made the legendary
beat 'em up game Sword of Sodan.

Taking their group name from the Mel Brooks movie of the same name,
Spaceballs is one of the oldest still-existing groups in the Amiga scene.
All the original members had names from the film, but as new members have
come to, this original concept has dwindled somewhat... Lone Starr almost
made the group big single-handedly, with his amazing winning streak in
1992-94. After their surprise win at The Gathering 92 with "Wayfarer", they
went and did what noone thought was possible: They won at The Party too.
Their demo "State of the Art" was something fresh and new, and the scene
loved it...except for those who ended up below them on the final results
and didn't like the fact that a 'no-code' demo by a relatively unknown
Norwegian group had beaten them! They further strengthened their shares in
the market by recruiting the makers of the leading diskmag at the time,
R.A.W, at The Gathering 93. At that party they finished third with the
three-day production "Mobile: Destination Unknown" and their followup to
SOTA at The Party, "Nine Fingers", only managed fourth. However, they
continued to strengthen their team, this time by recruiting Facet and
SuperNao in 1994...
  1992 - Norwegian musician Scott joined from Addonic sometime between
january and april. Norwegian graphician Morten (ex Dexion) left the scene
mid 93.
  1994 - Norwegian musician Travolta (Rune Svendsen), responsible for the
great soundtracks for demos like "State of the Art" [12/92] and "Nine
Fingers" [12/93], left the scene to pursue a career in professional music.
This most likely happened sometime in early 1994. Check out the norwegian
techno compilation CD 'XS To The Ravezone II' for a tune from his
professional band 'The BEK'.
  1995 - Dutch duo Facet (gfx) and SuperNao (music, both ex Lemon., new
12/93) left to join Virtual Dreams in may. The rest of the Dutch members
left en masse at The Party 5 in december; graphician Danny (ex Lemon.)
joined Nah-Kolor (he later ended up with old teammates Facet and SuperNao in
TBL), coder Tim (ex Motive, new early95) joined The Black Lotus and coder
Dope (ex Lemon., new 12/93) rejoined Reality a couple of weeks later.
  1996 - Norwegian musician Chris Meland joined Abyss in april.

Swedish graphician Phase's stay in Spaceballs was a brief one, and he has
  now joined Essence.
Norwegian musician and TG95 organizer Lizard (ex Lemon. old, new 12/93)
  left to join forces with supergroup The Black Lotus.
Norwegian graphician TMB Designs (ex The Silents, new 12/92-94) left the
  scene, and like so many others started working full time at Funcom.
  TMB was the author of graphics for several great Spaceballs demos, like
  "State of the Art" (12/92), "Mobile: Destination Unknown" (04/93), "9
  Fingers" (12/93) and "Dizzy Tunes II" (94).

  also attempts to showcase Lone Starr's vector routine's ability to display
  round objects, but the few small ones here hardly impress. Overlaid over
  this is a white textplotter, and at the bottom of the screen we find a
  rather garish yellow logo by Sator, made to look like a cheese :)

  review: Perhaps this 'story' demo is meant as a humourous parody of
  Alcatraz' "Odyssey" (1991)? It's a fun ride any way you look at it.
  Just like with "Odyssey", this beat another demo (Andromeda "D.O.S") with
  perhaps better code and more 'demo' parts in a major competition. It was
  just a taste of things to come, really, as Lone Starr would later prove.
  If people were surprised that this demo won the TG competition, they were
  amazed when Lone Starr won at The Party too. My favourite part is the
  'Weirdland' one, because of the atmosphere the visuals and the music
  creates. Just look at it as the first '3d scene' ever, and it takes on a
  completely new dimension, doesn't it? Just a fun demo, and nothing else!
    Though it works perfectly fine on my accelerated system, turning off
  the caches prevents heavy graphical errors during the vector parts.
  Though ADL suggests setting the chipset to OCS also, this is not really
  necessary. Also, please note that the music and text timing will be way
  off on accelerated systems. Therefore this demo is best viewed on A500's.

  Review: The winner of The Party 2 compo spawned a thousand irritated
  comments and - probably - a thousand clones. Love it or hate it, SOTA
  certainly shook the scene in its foundations. Suddenly one more face on
  your glenz vector routine didn't matter as much as entertainment value.
  The demo consists of animations of a woman dancing to the beat of a
  techno tune, and was painted over by genlocking a video'ed dancer.
  The girl who dances in the demo is Jannicke Selmer-Olsen, a winner of
  several dance competitions! And juding from the picture in "R.A.W #5", she
  doesn't look half bad, either ;) A follow-up demo, "Nine Fingers", was
  released at The Party the next year. Unfortunately it only reached the
  fourth place, and hence never repeated the original's success.
    The demo had a very buggy trackloader, which was highly incompatible.
  Cracking group Skid Row took it upon themselves to 'fix' it, and soon
  after released a working version. What is perhaps not so wellknown is the
  fact that SOTA was *NOT* the first of its kind. A demo by Deform was
  released earlier in the year the looked quite similar.

  review: It's hard to find anything to critize in the best mag on the
  scene, so I'll refrain from trying too much :) The first thing that
  strikes your eyes, naturally, is the intro. This time it's a simple, but
  welldesigned one, with exceptional music by Scott. I always loved the
  sweet simplicity of this intro...it signals style and assurance.
    Well, the mag itself is as good as always, with provoking and
  interesting articles by 'the king of provocation'. There's nothing wrong
  with the visuals either, Peachy delivers a smashing loading picture
  portraying dolphins at play in an underwater/overwater perspective.
  Just beautiful! Of course, Fairfax' traditional welcome picture isn't far
  behind. This time it's a naked woman stretched out on a white background.
  I've always liked naked women :)

  code: Paul "Lone Starr" Endresen, Sverre "Major Asshole" Rekvin,

  4th in The Party 93 demo competition.
  review: The follow-up to their much-criticized "State of the Art" demo
  is loved by many, and hated by a few - for much the same reason that they
  hated the original. The main criticism directed at the two demos were the
  fact that the coding wasn't 'advanced' enough, that SOTA was just painted
  animations and that 9F was just video processed through a converter.
  While both statements are true, there is no denying the entertainment
  value of these productions. The musicvideo-like demos have been copied
  time and time again, a.o. in Compact's two "Hiplash" 40k intros.
  The animation quality in 9F is surprisingly good, to the point where it
  actually took a few moments the first time I saw it to realise it was
  vector-built and not actual bitplane animation! The tune is not quite as
  funky as SOTA's instant classic "Condom Corruption", but still does the
  job adequately enough. As you may heve guessed by now, I'm part of the
  camp that loves this demo. I'll personally put entertainment value over
  advanced coding any day.
    While the demo is fully watchable on an ECS 1mb machine, the animations
  will take longer to play back. Since the demo is timed to the music, it
  moves on once it has gotten to a certain point. Therefore you get to see
  more of each animation on an A1200 (that is capable of running it at full
  speed) than on inferior machines. President Screw's trackloader is also
  worth a mention. You can, if you wish, run the entire 9F demo from DF1:!
  It can boot from any drive, and accept disks from any drive. The demo got
  its name because Lone Starr broke one finger during the coding, and had
  to finish the demo with Nine Fingers! A classic.

  review: This little baby opens with the words 'Funky Pixels', under which
  a trip through a canyon soon appears. It looked MIGHTY up there on the
  big screen, believe me :) The screen gradually becomes more cramped while
  the vector animation is running, until it skips to the next part. This
  part is just a text writer over a HUGE rubber vector cube. And that's it.
  Short but sweet, it has a sudden impact not often. The music is divine.
  With another effect and some proper graphics, it would have been GREAT.
  Now, it's just good. Still, good is a lot better than bad ;)
    The landscape was first rendered in Vista, then traced with Lone
  Starr's vector tracer - the same routine used for his demo 'Nine
  Fingers'. Requires 1.5MB of memory, though AGA requirement is uncertain.
  Can anyone test on an ECS machine?

  remains. Design is OK, Dreamfish' chippy is very C64 and very chippy.

  (det er mere gøy å drikke øl enn å kode!), which sort-of shows here and
  there, but the overall design is certainly among Slummy's better work.
  I especially like the credits-heads... The effects mostly consists of
  colour-stuff, with swirling 'tunnels' and the like. I'll get back you
  with a more detailed description of the fx later, when time permits!
  The music is a little weird, but then again it had to be. Still, a very
  adequate tune. I like this, but as mentioned above, I might be biased :)

  review: This is not a half bad 40k'er, if this is your kind of thing...
  You see, this one focuses a lot more on mood than on mindblowing effects,
  and the effects that are here are more of the undefinable quality... It's
  hard to explain, really, but think of a underground techno version of
  Stellar's classic "Darkroom", where the effects were never that advanced -
  but it didn't matter since the mood was so great. This is a lot like that

  review: Slummy's 64k intro for TG99 is a much more focused effort than his
  demo at the same party, "SuperMonster" [04/99]. Some nice design, coupled
  with a piece of music we can only describe as 'original' apparently took
  this admittedly very short entry to the top of the competition. I think
  even Slummy himself must have been suprised by this, since even though
  it's cool it's very very short.

  review: Though jerky on my 030-50, the introductionary 3d scene, over
  which a single spaceballs logo is overlaid, are impressive. Then a not-so-
  smooth fade into a small piece of loading is entered, before a
  Supermonster logo is introduced to some good techno music. Next is an old
  effect, voxelspace, and not the best ever example either. Too much
  flashing! The effect is kept too long, and neither the woman's face nor
  the lightsource that is introduced later help proceedings. The next effect
  is a similarly uninteresting tunnel. Then comes something nice and
  original, that I don't exactly know how to describe :), except it looks
  slightly caleidoscopic. Th4en a credit sequence before envmapping. The
  next effect is also nice, but I don't know how to describe that either ;)
  More nicelty executed effects follow, including several envmapped
  variations, all with animated backgrounds and even overlaid graphics here
  and there...and then it's all over. Perhaps not the best demo ever, but
  with some nice parts. You should do more with your 3d scenes Remi! :)
    Should work on any 020+ amiga I suppose, but I wouldn't recommend
  anything LESS than my 030-50. As for memory requirements, I don't know...
  but at least some... ;)

TRSI, where he continues to release new versions of his utility Virus
Workshop.
  1990 - Pilka (ex Success, new ca 07/90) left to build a new group, and
their german board 'FIRE POWER' was opened ca 10/90. MLP Artworx (music) and

· Master Utilities Intro (1990, late, ECS Intro).
  review: An OK intro this, supposedly for a compact disk they did called
  Master Utilities. I found this intro on another compact :) The music, by
  the way, is in Future Composer 1.0-1.3 format. The design is quite OK,
  and there's not really anything to put your finger on. An ok intro.
  No credits appear anywhere in the intro, except that the pack was done
  by Ivan/TSB Germany.

Spectral (1992-)
----------------
FIN> Zon (swap, ex Zenith, new 08/92).

Spectral was formed late 1992.


Spectre (1989-)
---------------
SWE> Mightymuz (Mathias Olsson, swap, 11/90-01/91).
???> Daredevil (10/89).

Spectre was born in march 1989 as a Swedish group doing demos and cracks.


Speedy
------
DEN> The Flash (K.Andersen, code swap).
???> Backfire (swap), Breakbeat (music), Energizer (gfx), Germic (gfx),
     Jummer (swap), Le Renard (code), Magz (gfx swap), M.G.P. (code), Mosher
     (swap), Pixie (gfx), Scoop (code), The Collector (code), The Hunter
     (gfx), Wea (ex Analog, new late94), Yabbo (music).

Speedy was formed by Steffen, who later left to form a reborn Parasite.
However, the original Parasite founders reacted very negatively and refused
him the rights to the name. He therefore rejoined one of his older groups;
Jewels.


Spetsnar

  Saltsild (1993, 07.04, ECS Intro).

Spetsnaz
--------
Spetsnaz were the arrangers of the Happening parties in Norway.

· Happening 94 Invitation (1994, ECS File).
  code: Creator, gfx: Hacksaw, Man, music: Macro.
  review: Most of you will not understand shit of the text in this intro,
  since it's entirely in Norwegian. Having said that, this IS after all an
  invitation to a small Norwegian party, so it sort of makes sense.
  There's nothing revolutionary here, as you might guess.
    The full LHA package comes with a map, some icons and the invitation
  text also.

Spirit [old]
------------
Countach is the name of the cooperation between Aeon and Spirit. The name
was assumed on 01/10-90.


Spirit [new]
------------
SWE> Regent (trade, early92), Shadow Turtle (founder, ex Vogue).
???> Joker (ex Dictators), Sparks (sysop, ex Delight).

Spirit was formed by Mightymuz and Shadow Turtle from Vogue. The new and old
Spirit are in no way related to each other. In late 1992, all Swedish
members left for other groups.
  1991 - Empty joined from Anthrox, and stayed for 1-2 months. Then he
changed his handle to Ford and moved on to LSD late 91.
  1992 - Swedish swapper Lando (ex Skid Row) changed his handle to Paragon
and joined Scoopex in august.

Finnish swapper and musician Daddy Freddy (ex Decept) joined Anthrox.
Flame and Nuke joined TRSI. Also, the entire Danish and French divisions
  joined!
Swedish original founder Mightymuz (ex Vogue) joined Skid Row (RAW #3) or
  Fusion, then 2000 AD (Eurochart #16).
Swedes Cone (ex Desire) and Sudden (ex Amaze, new early92) joined Noxious.
  Also, Inferno joined, but it's highly uncertain when it happened.
Swedish sysop Xstaz ('ICE PALACE', ex Amaze, new early92) joined Alpha
  Flight.

· Another Crack Intro (ECS Intro).
  code: SZH, gfx: Fairfax/PMC (logo), music: n/a.
  review: Not the best cracktro in the world, this is hampered especially by
  its annoying soundtrack, and a general 'beginner' feel. It features a
  largely purple logo by Fairfax, probably some early work from him 'cause
  it's far from good. The middle of screen is a textplotter with a vertical
  starfield in the background, and then a scroller at the bottom. There are
  two twisting rasterbars separating the different parts of the screen.
  Sound familiar at all? Seen a million of these, don't really wanna see any
  more unless there's good graphics and sound...

     Maxime (founder^Internet, ex Ram Jam), Posdnuos (Micoli Cristiano,
     founder swap, ex Ram Jam), Rocketeer (founder swap, ex Ram Jam).

Formed by five ex-Ram Jam members early 1996 to make games. However, in a
newsfile I found on AmiNet, it said they had not left the scene when they
formed TSF.


Spoon (SPN)
-----------
DEN> Christine de la Queen (Christine Hansen, leader gfx), Shayera (John
     Hinge, code, 12/94-12/95).
???> B-Toven (music, 12/94), Duffy (code, ex Insane).

3D graphician Subsonic left to join Puzzle.
Growl was kicked.
The two ex-Parasite members Dino (gfx) and Gotcha (code) left Spoon and the
  Amiga scene to start up Parasite again on the PC.

  code: Shayera, gfx: various, music: Slide/Polka Brothers.
  25th in The Party 4 40k intro competition.
  review: A nice little intro with three main effects. It opens with a 24
  bit 4x4 display of a woman's face scrolling in all directions. Then
  there's an afterburned vector thingy before the concluding fireworks.
  This last effect is reminiscent of what Red Sector Inc. had in their
  classic MEGADEMO. Not at all bad...but too short, I guess.

· Hovsa (1995, 28.12, AGA 4k Intro).
  code: Shayera, gfx/music: none.
  Released for the Party 5 4k intro competition.
  review: Short and quite sweet, this 4k'er consists of two good-looking
  effects. The first is a classic Keftales effect. We've seen it a thousand
  times, but it's still nice. The second is a sort of plasma-bitplane-
  scroll thing. You'll know it when you see it. Anyway, nice.

Spreadpoint (http://www.spreadpoint.com)

Spreadpoint is a demo group most fondly remembered for its coders. Buddha
brought us the first texturemapped vectors and MasterSEKA, while Mnemotron
brought us many improvements in the then-popular SoundTracker series. Thomas
is the coder of the 'World Charts', where Autopsy/Hoodlum is editor...
German coder TIP is identical to TIP/TNM, who coded the original
MasterCruncher and later the first 8 channel music program, Oktalyzer.
  1990 - Austrian coder Depeche (code train gfx, new 89) left in 1990. He
later turned up briefly in Defjam, before leaving the scene for good. Their
german bbs (sysop Merlin) was shut down ca 07/90. Austrians Mike (code),
Tilt (code) and Matthew joined from Subway ca 10/90. Austrian founder Mike
(code) left in 1990, leaving the group without a leader. He has later worked
for Microsoft, and is today coding software for cellular phones. Munster
took over organizing after Mike left.

German graphician Ucom left.
Lunatic rejoined Interactive.
Frenchman Daryl (ex The Silents) joined Shining.
Slash (swi trade), Matthew (aut, ex Subway), Tilt (aut code crack, ex
  Subway), GeorgeII (aut code crack) and Flash joined Defjam.
Belgian trader Dr.Doolittle (new 05/90) quickly joined The Silents 06/90.
Belgian sysops Cocaine and Dr.Avalanche ('FLYING SAUCER', ex Adept) quickly
  went on to Alpha Flight (RAW5^SLH11). Another source said Cocaine joined
  Addonic, yet another said Uli was sysop of 'FLYING SAUCER' and that HE
  joined Alpha Flight. The information on Uli as sysop of 'F S' seem to be
  correct, making my confusion total. Can anyone clarify?

  review: This demo is probably the first ever Amiga demo to feature real

  lot of scrolltext and the demo appears eventually' variety (which I hate)
  but it's still worth a look if only for novelty's sake. The demo uses
  Buddha's own Overload system, so it's impossible to manually decrunch :(

· Per Favore (1990, late, ECS Intro).
  code: Amix, gfx: Shade, Freddy, music: -ripped-
  review: Starline calls this, their first production, a demo - but we have
  decided to brand it otherwise. It's a singlescreen affair, with a typical
  '1990 flavour', but not the worst of its kind. It's got a certain air of
  competence about it. The screen is essentially split in two; The top half
  has a 'waving' yellow Starline logo (not bad) overlaid on a 3d starfield.
  The bottom has a checkerboard moving towards the viewer, and around the
  middle is a sinusscroller - again overlaid on equalizers (three different
  kinds are chooseable with the right mousebutton). Strangely enough, this
  is not as cluttered as it may sound. Typical of its time, but a good
  example of said style nevertheless.
    Caches off, original chipset was the only way to get this to work on my
  configuration. The music was ripped from a game (as they openly admit),
  but we regrettably were not able to discover exactly which one.

???> Exit (code, 07/90), Jack (gfx, 07/92), MonBoot (gfx, 12/92), The R
     (den? gfx, 05/91).

Static Bytes' biggest claim to fame may be that they were the group chosen
to take over the job of publishing the Eurocharts when Crusaders quit.
They were given the go-ahead in July 1992, and released the first issue of
the NEW Eurocharts shortly after. Christian Estrup, the editor, later
worked as a professional journalist for a big Danish computer magazine.
He is also the author of the ProTracker module packer/optimizer ProPacker.
  1991 - In November Gawk and Trace were kicked due to inactivity, and The
R and Elin helped form a new group called Focus Design. The group was
further weakened when Hawkeye (ex Prologic, new 09/91) left for the new
Kefrens, but some of the damage was perhaps repaired with the joining of
graphician JTF. While all of this was going on, they still managed to
release lots of product, making the final months of the year some of their
busiest ever. Norwegian graphician TMB Designs joined The Silents late 91.
  1995 - Danish musician Cutcreator (09/91-), responsible for most of the
soundtracks on the Eurocharts, left for Passion late 95.

Danish swapper Jones (ex Rednex, new early92-07/92) joined the new Rednex.
Graphician Sauron (ex Equinox, 07/92) moved back to Norway and joined Scoop.
  He won the graphics competition at The Gathering 92 with "The Beauty and
  the Beast". In addition, he started working at the game making company
  DiMaga Studios.
Norwegian graphician Marvel (02-12/92) changed his handle to Joachim and
  joined The Crusaders. This is highly ironic, since he made the graphics
  for several issues of the old Crusaders production "EuroChart" when it
  became a Static Bytes production :-)

  review: This is certainly a neat little intro, with some good design
  helped immensly by TMB's excellent graphics. The overall effect is
  convincing, and the intro manages to feel fresh even though it isn't
  particularly :) As the title suggests, glenzvectors in all shapes and
  sizes are the order of the day, and the intro presents some nice
  variations on the theme, like rubberglenz. There is no conventional exit
  routine, but each 'part' can be exited with the left mousebutton, which
  eventually gets you to the end of the show. Nice, compact and competent.
  Cutcreator can do a lot better, tho!
    I had some difficulty with this intro, the graphics wouldn't display
  properly even with KillAGA. I finally had to boot from the disk (no
  caches etc) to make it work - although the music still bugs.

  final Crusaders issue. Not much has changed from the Crusaders days,
  though, the interface remains the same old one. This is quite remarkable,
  actually, since the mag was totaly recoded - it still looks 100% exactly
  the same :) The graphics are about on par with what Crusaders produced,
  and so is the editorial content. Not much more to say about this first
  issue; it's the logical next step.
  An intro was released to announce this at The Gathering '92.

  review: Marvel's graphics aren't really a stunner this time, but it's not
  too bad either. A high amount of cliparts from TMB Designs/TSL help raise
  the level a lot, though. Cutcreator's tune is a small disappointment too.
  Let's hope he does better in the next issue :)
    Editorially, there's not much out of the ordinary this time either.
  There's the new jokes section, of course, but that can't really be
  counted as an editorial advancement...

  review: After the nice titlepic, the main graphics were a bit of a
  disappointment. Luckily, there were some nice cliparts in the Euronews
  section to look at :) Archmage/Andromeda and CAT/Essence deliver the
  goods, while the rest of the clips are never above average. Cutcreator's
  music is great, as usual. Very typical for his style, with the tune
  having several, quite different parts. Nicely done.

Boards; SLAUGHTER HOUSE (fin).

Stellar were formed by the previous Finnish section of Equinox. The same
mag that brought the news of their forming (EuroChart #15) also brough the
news of their death (they had supposedly formed Vision SF). I think not!
  They are most known for their advanced demos. The names seem to indicate
that Dweezil and Nose are brothers? I'm not sure I understand the joining/
eaving situation with Kube between Stellar and Virtual Dreams...unless he
joined and left both groups several times :) I have ONE sysop and ONE
board, so I guess it's a fair assumption that Burefalos is sysop of
'SLAUGHTER HOUSE'?

· Eurochart 25 Trailer Intro (AGA File).
  code: Hook/Genocide, gfx: Frankie/Stellar, Harri R (animation), music:

  review: The opening of this small demo is quite impressive - it's an
  animation, where we travel around a mountain top, and some terrain.
  It's very impressive, and I'm still not sure if it's actual footage or if
  it was rendered... There's only one other real 'routine' in the demo, a
  good zoomrotator with stretching and smoothing (?) Anyway, it looks real
  nice, and the picture doesn't appear blocky at all. Hmm...
    Made to announce the upcoming 'Eurochart #25' by Static Bytes. Why on
  earth such an intro was made by Stellar and Genocide, I don't have the
  faintest idea :)

  review: This one opens with a Stellar logo of acceptable quality by
  Frankie. Then it gets off to a flying start with a great flight over a
  voxel landscape to the opening part of Strobo's tune - which is
  incidentally the best part. Then a Mindflow logo appears (which could
  have been MUCH better). From there it goes through good renditions of
  some of the more popular effects of the time - fullscreen rot-zoomer with
  stretching, texturemapped cube, Doom routine, realtime 2x2 (I think)
  zooming fractal and so on. A quite good demo, and an essential addition
  to anyone's demo collection. I seem to remember it demands some fastmem.

  code: Dweezil, gfx: n/a, music: Strobo.
  3rd place in the Assembly 94 40k intro competition.
  review: I always liked this for its originality. There had never been
  anything quite like it before, it was something brand new at the time...
  What makes Darkroom special is the mood of the thing; that dark, mystic
  feeling that it evokes...and Strobo's industrial soundtrack is a very
  important part of that. Not to be missed. It is worth noting, though,
  that on a machine as fast as mine, it looses some of its value because
  the effects move TOO quickly. Therefore, best viewed on an A500 ;)

  review: The world's first HAM8 3D-Terrain (or more correctly: voxelspace)
  they claim. It sure looks rather good, though the resolution could
  perhaps be a little better... Still, I remember being totally blown away
  by this when I first saw it. Being used to shitty ECS stuff, I thought it
  looked AWESOME! Though this is a one-effect intro, it sure is a good-
  looking one...
    There's some text in the intro saying things like 'try to find the
  hidden part!' Is there one?

  review: It's the usual rendering stuff from Stellar, perhaps a little
  more entertaining than usual. The one thing that was a positive
  surprise was the music. It's a quite dynamic tune from Groo, perhaps a
  little Lizardking-y at times, but really good! The text file says it

  review: Ok, but clearly a '2-day production' as it says at the end.
  It's the usual Stellar stuff, with texture-mapped/rendered shapes flying
  around, and not much else. Technically competent, but not too exciting.
  Groo's music is it's usual weird self, but still one of his better tunes.

  code: Nose, gfx: Frankie, music: Dune.
  9th in The Party 5 demo competition.
  review: Opens with a orange Galerie logo, then onto a fast but blocky
  voxel landscape with a 'looking-at-the-sun' effect. Next up are three
  shaded rings, and a bumpmapped object. Then a tunnel appears. This is the
  fastest effect (or so their system-tester tells me, 48fps :), and the one
  which looks best, to boot. Next up is a texturemapped and phong-shaded
  stone object, then a bump-tunnel. After that, a cityscape appears. It has
  that same 'looking-at-the-sun' effect, but that doesn't make it any more
  exciting. Then, a 'Dune-Tunnel'. Next up we have a yellowish morphing
  bumpmapped landscape, which would have looked better if it was a bit
  faster. A texturemapped and gouraud-shaded landscape ends the show, which
  reminded me a little about standing close to a mountain looking up, in
  the dark. If this last effect was developed a little further, it could
  have been great-looking. An average release that's yet again presented in
  that annoying 'ghosted' style. Aaaarrgh!

  Winner of the Juhla 96 demo competition!
  review: Well, it's Galerie with a couple of new pics, new music, a few
  new (and unusual!) textures, and without the original's last couple of
  effects. Lacks design, and doesn't have either a dynamic design or any
  real sense of identity. Just effects set to music. Oh, I nearly forgot -
  it now runs in a smaller window (drawback, but needs less processor
  power), and without the 'ghosted' effect (improvement!).

  review: Having just watched Lights for the first time, I'm left in a
  state of awe. It hasn't got INCREDIBLY revolutionary code, but what there
  is looks so good it's totally forgiveable. It opens (after precalculating
  for a while) with an impressive tunnel effect while some words flash in
  the top left of the screen before stopping at the word Stellar. Then
  we're quickly on to a sort of wave/ripple routine, which isn't the best
  part of the intro. But Stellar saves the best for last, and finally
  presents us with a showstopping effect: Mapped and shaded coins fall down
  from the top of the screen, with little sparkles added when the light
  falls on them. At the top of the screen, the text 'I Had A Dream...'
  scrolls slowly from the right to the left. Then we're treated to the end
  logo, LIGHTS with a spotlight effect on it. All through this we're
  treated to one of Groo's coolest tunes in a long while. What makes LIGHTS
  a winner is that little something undefinable... It's the same quality
  that they achieved with DARKROOM all those years ago. Highly recommended.

Stone Arts was an all-Norwegian demo group, like Andromeda, formed by the
best 8 members of Atomic in march 1993. I've made an educated guess that
those 8 were Ice, Dolphin, Hugo, Kekken, Shape, Storm, Rozzoe and Syntex.
Shortly after, at The Gathering, they released their first two demos.
ROM4 announced their death through spokesperson Dolphin. Most members were
employed by Funcom.
  1994 - Norwegian graphician and cofounder Kekken left to join Talent in
february. Ranx/Balance was a very shorttime member, and rejoined Balance
only days after joining.
  1995 - Norwegian graphician Absurd joined from Scoopex in late 94, only to
rejoin in early 1995.

Norwegians Braintumor and Heywood (music, 12/93) and Niggerjack (code) all
  joined Gollum.
Norwegian founder and editor Dolphin formed the new Atomic with Colorbird/

· Gathering 93 Demo (1993, 07.04, ECS File).
  code: Coke, BCR, gfx: Coke, BCR (opening pic), music: Rozzoe.
  Released at The Gathering 93.
  review: This is the weaker of the two demos STA released at TG 93.
  Though competent here and there, with nice smooth design, they're like an
  Andromeda without the focus; like a Lemon. without the Lem :)
  The music and graphics are just bland, and the only cool and unusual code
  I guess were the three ellipses with shadows - though the routine could
  certainly have been exposed better if for example the objects were
  larger. Promises but does not deliver.
    I've seen this mentioned with the name Announce, but that name doesn't
  appear anywhere in the demo. The demo will require absolutely ALL memory
  if run on an A500 with ½mb fake fast - and probably won't work at all on
  2.0+ machines based on my own experiences.

  code: Niggerjack, gfx: Coke, music: Braintumor & Heywood.
  Winner of The Gathering '94 40k intro competition!
  review: Niggerjack, Braintumor & Heywood's first production for Stone
  Arts would prove to be their most successful yet! It opens with a few
  dot routines, and ends with a HAM rotzoomer that is truly a thing of
  beauty, just as Niggerjack himself claims. Not much bang for your buck,
  except for the rotzoomer, but still a good enough production.

  code: Coke, Ranx (last effect), gfx: BCR (uncredited), music: Redferne.
  3rd in The Gathering '94 40k intro competition.
  review: STA's 3rd-placer at the party where they won with 'Bjarne' is
  just as good. There's a few OK effects here, of which I especially dug
  the double STA twister. However, that pseudo-plasma thing looks like the
  blocky stuff they do on the C64 to achieve the same effect. On a 1mhz
  machine, that's impressive - on an A1200 that's pathetic. The picture
  used in the rotzoomer is a small portion of BCR's title picture for
  Headline #1.

· Vidar! (1994, 28.12, AGA 40k Intro).
  code: Niggerjack, gfx: Absurd, music: Braintumor & Heywood.
  Released for The Party 4 40k intro competition, but was disqualified.
  review: It opens with the letters S T O N E A R T S flying at you in
  rapid succession timed to the music, before the intro gets going with the
  three letters STA on fire! Then we're shown some text before a rather
  awesome 3x3 rotzoomer appears, that's controllable in almost every and
  any way! Unfortunately, I don't get to see that on my machine, which you
  shows me some garbled graphics. Slummy/Spaceball's theory about why this
  happens was the it was probably selfmodifying in some way and any
  accelerated Amiga was just too fast to cope with it. Therefore the dots
  did not appear where they should :) The picture that's rotzoomed is
  "Smokin'" by Absurd, which also participated in the graphics competition
  at the same party and came in at a split 20th.
    The intro was originally supposed to compete in the 40k intro
  competition at The Party, but the disk it was delivered on was corrupt,
  and it was disqualified. It was therefore just released at the party.

Strange [old] (-1992)
---------------------
SWE> Zender (swap edit "Nordic Report").
???> Cyborg, Rufus.

Strange is a swedish demo group perhaps best known for releasing three
issues of the diskmag "Nordic Report", and for being one of Lizardking's
first groups. There is no connection between the old and the new Strange as
far as I can understand...
  1992 - The group started falling apart around the middle of the year.
Their biggest asset, musician Lizardking, left the group for Alcatraz and
only 2 or 3 members remained.

Swedish musician Lizardking joined Alcatraz.
Swedish musician Deelite (ex Enigma) was only a member for a brief period,
  before he rejoined Enigma.
Swedes Core (ex Eagles, old handle Arrow) and Tony (gfx) left to form
  Hijack with Crayone (ex Defjam).

These two Swiss guys joined together when Black was refused to join Style's
crew, Alcatraz. As a result, Style left ATZ instead, and they formed this
little crew. Eyes was their first independent release.

ceased to exist. Among the people who joined from Disaster were Deckard,
Gayhawk, Hexagon and Liquid.

  Manual Override (1995, 14.04, Demo).
  Released at The Gathering 95.

· Pyt (1995, 09.07, AGA 4MB Multifile).
  code: Hexagon, Gayhawk, Gifair, gfx: Deckard, Syl (raytrace), music: Lava
  and Liquid. Winner of the South Seland Party 95 demo competition!
  review: Pyt opens with two GRRRREAT rendered logos by Syl. These two
  logos are so fab you'd be hard pressed to tell they were rendered and not
  hand drawn by some fabulously talented graphics artist. WOW! What's more,
  it goes from strength to strength by following this with an amazing
  animation of lights flying through an underwater landscape. Words cannot
  describe how beautiful this is!
    Though the demo claims to run with 4MB fast, it needs all of it. I had
  my kickstart remapped to fastram on my old 4mb fast setup, and never got
  this one to work.

  review: The results from the ASM96 intro competition continues to puzzle
  me. This is clearly among the better ones, though perhaps a little short.
  What matters, though, is the quality. This one's got a phong object
  moving over a cool tunnel effect, with an afterburner effect (ala
  Artwork's "Dawn") and such. The point is, this looks, sounds and feels
  great! Coolness has been achieved.
    The missing credits are due to the almost unreadable credits that
  flashes across the screen. I _THINK_ Origo is the coder, not least since
  the demo uses his operating system :)

  smoooooothly changing color hues, and looks just...smashing! Overlaid on
  this, several pages of text and a trainer selector appears as you press

  nice and bouncy. It's just 5k in unpacked form, but doesn't sound it.

  review: The demo opens with the text Sunshine Productions, and an SSP
  logo in the background. It then slowly fades the two together, before
  we're taken into the demo proper with the usual techno music. The music,
  though well done, is a bit too monotonous to maintain my interest. As for
  the effects, they are numerous and well-executed. There's even a few I
  don't know how are done! This was a welcome suprise.
    Pad's fabulous picture of a girl sniffing a flower won the graphics
  competition at the party. Requires at least an 020-28, though they
  recommend an 060 and more then 4mb RAM for maximum enjoyment. The demo

Supplex was an illegal cracker and trainer group, probably based in Austria

section has one or two familiar names... Logo 7 did a series of trainers
called 'Capital Trainer' (short: CAPTRA). There were more than 100 in the
series...

dead were incorrect, but Mr.Rox, Guru Luke, Alf, Bitcracker and Gordon left
for Supreme. Spreader Condorman left for Tarkus Team. Zine #5 [08/90]

S!P started life as a subgroup of TRSI, serving as their demo section.
However, in 1992 they took the entire group and left. This resulted in
Germans Flynn, TSM, Warhead, Dreamer and Peachy leaving S!P to join up with
mothergroup TRSI. The rest of the group joined Scoopex, but later left them
too, to continue life as a separate group in their own right.
'EVERYWARE's sysop is not a S!P member, but Zike is a cosys on the board.

· Prism-Vectors (1991, 07.12, ECS File).
  code: Dreamer, gfx^music: Peachy (music in NoisePacker 3 format).
  3rd in the Prime 91 demo competition.
  review: This is a welldesigned little intro/demo, much thanks to a couple
  of clearcut, yet simply elegant logos from Peachy. His soundtrack for
  this is not half bad either, if I may say so. It's very of its time -
  and probably heavily influcenced by "Cream of the Earth" - but as such
  it's not the worst example of the genre. Not bad. Oh, and I guess we
  haven't seen those prism vectors before either, have we? It's a minor
  variation on the standard glenz, really, but doesn't look too bad. This
  is more of an intro than a demo.
    This was the first german S!P production, made while they were a TRSI
  subgroup. Also known as Bistro.

  review: This S!P production features quite a lot of glenz vectors, though
  the most interesting thing about it is the graphics - there is some good
  work here. The demo was made while they were a Scoopex subdivision, and
  features a lot of Scoopex logos and the like. The music was used in an
  issue of World Charts too, and Uno's logo also looks familiar...
    Scoopex' homepage incorrectly claims that someone called Alias is the
  coder.

Symbiosis was originally a French demo group, and its whq remained in
France even though divisions from other countries were recruited. Their
strong norwegian section took over a lot of attention, among other things by
arranging the two "Rendezvous" parties in Kristiansand in the summers of
1992 and 1993.

Boards; TRANCE ILLUSION (fra).

Mostly French demogroup Syndrome was split up by its most known member
Tenshu at the Saturne Party 97. Some of the members formed an almost fully
PC group by the name of Elend; this group consisted of Tenshu (gfx, 08-
09/96), Nitryk (gfx, doublememb, 08-09/96), Zaac (gfx), Kobi (3d), Traven
(music), Embroaz (music), Fks (code), Francisco (code) and Obyone (code).
Frenchmen Codac (Hakim Ramdane, code gfx, 12/95-12/96) and Bosco (music,
11/96), plus some others, left the scene. Most of these people are now split
between the two groups Syndrome and Cocoon on the pc.
  1997 - Germans JCS (gfx) and Marc (music, both ex Scoopex, both
doublemembs Sector 7, 12/96-) probably left the group sometime after april.
They retained their S7 memberships. Key Frenchmen Guille (code, ex Ram Jam,
08/96-) and Nytrik (gfx, 12/96-) left the amiga to form Cocoon on the pc.
Nowadays, also Maf and Tenshu are in this group.

German swapper Ghandy/Gods (03/97) has terminated his membership, and is now
  in Darkage as his second group instead.

  review: I'm sorry, Syndrome, but this sucks. Obviously based on the great
  arcade/Playstation martial arts game Tekken, it limits its 'emulation' to
  1 plane afterburned undetailed vector representations of two people
  fighting. Still, what irritates me the most about this is the 'music';
  It's my nominee for most annoying chiptune ever. I find no evidence that
  this requires AGA, and can find no error codes in the file. Still, you
  never know...

  review: Syndrome presents us with a few envmapped objects and not much
  else. The objects are a little unusual, but in this case unusual does not
  equal good. The chippy is loud and irritating, and it's not hard to see
  how Artwork's "Dawn.remix" beat this.

  review: I am stunned. I am absolutely, totally stunned. This intro is
  FUCKING AMAZING! How this could end up at 10th I'll never know. Jeez!
  It opens with an object 'surfing on water' over a good Syndrome logo, and
  continues with a FAST scene with camera angles and everything! It looks
  so good, I could actually cry.
    The intro itself contains no specific credits apart from the names
  Nastyboy, Tenshu, Maf. However, when you depack the intro and hex-read it
  you can see text saying it was coded by Codac. Can anyone solve this
  mystery?

· Hardcore (1996, 02.11, AGA Multifile).
  code: Codac, gfx: Tenshu, music: Bosco.
  Winner of the Saturne Party 4 demo competition!
  review: The mood is what makes Hardcore. I'm telling you: this is the most
  frightening demo you're ever likely to see. It's not a horror demo per se,
  it's more the kind of horror you'd find in a movie like Seven. The demo
  opens with a digitized animation that's gonna go down in demo history as
  one of the most WHAMmy openings ever! During the course of the demo we're
  shown some fair effects and quite a few Tenshu pictures, but as I
  mentioned above, this demo is made by the atmosphere, not the single
  effects. What can I say? Outstanding. Everything's Blue in this world...

  6th in The Party 6 demo competition!
  review: A great demo! This almost reeks of quality. The fact that this
  only finished in 6th is perhaps testament to the quality of the demos
  released at The Party 6. The demo opens with some powerful chords, the
  word 'SYNDROME' at the bottom of the screen and a perfectly drawn eye in
  the backrgound. After this it loads the credits sequence, which is even
  better with a great background picture and equally great coding and
  design... I can't adequately describe everything I love about this demo,
  but rest assured that it's quite a lot! There are impressive routines
  galore, a thumping great dance soundtrack and cool artwork. There are
  only 5 or 6 demos of this kind of quality released in any one year.
  From the twin faces phong object, to the huge flying ant object, to all
  the swirly tunnels and graphics manipulation, this is a fabulous piece of
  traditional demo art.
    There are both 4mb and 8mb versions delivered. I tried both, the 8mb
  one first, and I don't think there's anything really missing from the 4mb
  one. It's just lesser reslution and less smooth transmissions between
  parts that differ, as far as I can see. This demo is also WHOPPINGLY
  huge - it occupies 9MB of diskspace, would you believe? I wouldn't be
  much surprised if JCS' picture is the same as "Lava Girl", with which he
  came 5th in the graphics competition :) The picture in the final part, of
  the man holding his hands to his head, is by Tenshu even though he's not
  given any credit in the demo or the text files that come with it...
