Vacuum (VCM, 1996-)
-------------------
ENG> Hollywood (Simon M. Carless, founder music, ex Axis).
GRE> Stelios (founder code, ex Axis).
POL> Dave (Dawid Nabialek, swap, late95), Qix (swap, new late95).
???> Ania (new late95), Digital (gfx only 04/96, music only 06/96,

     Sixtus (pol? new late95), Trash (gfx, doublemember of Phuture 303
     06/96).

Vacuum was founded by Hollywood and Stelios after they left Axis in late
1996. I've seen a text file announcing their new chartmag 'Pump', the world
musician charts! The first issue was allegedly to have been released in
august/september 1995, which is highly unlikely!


Vajrayana (VRN, -1997)
----------------------
AGA, DIP, Rio and Slat left to join Elven 11 (E11). After the release of
the E11 demo "Smart" (03/97), which Mat helped do some work for, he also
left the group to join his old groupmates in the new group. This meant the
death of Vajrayana.

--------------------------
Boards; VALHALLA (usa), UNDERWORLD (usa), OUTLAND (usa), DARKSIDE (usa),
     TERRORDOME (usa), GREYHAVEN (usa), COLISEUM (usa).

Valhalla was probably the most shortlived illegal group ever. After making
some releases, and being in cooperation with Skid Row, its best members
(Arnie, Creeping Death, Copyrighthunter, Wiseman and Hawk) joined Skid Row,
and they died the same year they were born.

Vanish was formed by people from Mindkillers, Timex, RAF and Panic in the
middle of 1991. They also spent some time as Dynamix' and Ministry's demo
divisions. They are probably best known for their great graphician Navy...
They ceased to exist when they merged with Tech into the new group Logic in
1994.
  1991 - Dr.Oetker and Icecube joined The Special Brothers mid 91. Plauze
left mid 91, he was NOT kicked. He consequently joined Fairlight.
  1993 - Laurance joined Sceptic early 93.

Apollo joined Panic.
Lawbreaker (ex Awesome, new mid 91) joined Razor 1911.
Germans Montana Rice and Aerobase (swap, both ex Fate) joined Awesome.
  Aerobase was misspellt Herobase in RAW, which is incorrect.
German graphician Navy joined the newly formed B.A.S.F, but quickly moved
  on to TRSI.
German swapper Flash joined Frantic.

Vega was a mainly Italian demo group, formed by Filippetto after the death
of Amaze germany, probably around january. Filippetto brought his diskmag
"Freedom Crack" with him. Their first release was the intro "Official
Plasma" [91], announcing the new group. Then followed in quick succession
their first "Musicdisk" [91] and in march the fifth issue of "Freedom Crack"
[03/91].
  1992 - When Italians Filippetto (code), Bitjoker (code), DJ Mad (music

  review: The FC8 intro is nice, and sets a good atmosphere for the reading
  of the actual mag. Especially the great title picture, and Filippetto's
  funny, bouncy tune helps lift your spirit!
    Then, the mag itself: They have received a new code for this issue,
  and even though I haven't seen the one they previously used, this one
  ain't too shabby. At least it works on my machine :) Regarding
  compatibility; I had to depack the files to a disk in order to get it
  to work - most probably it needs to read its files from DF0:. The main
  problem on the A1200 is some distorted graphics inside the mag itself, but
  it's far from a major problem. The English in this mag is perhaps not the
  best I've ever seen, but it's far from the worst either. Just sample this
  little golden nugget from the news section of the mag: 'Some ENERGY
  members are wrong!' =) This issue offers interviews with Conquest/Anarchy,
  El Cubo/Crusaders and Sniffy/Energy. The mag gives a clean, good feel when
  using it. It's also the first mag I have ever seen to have a complete
  plasma routine as a background for an article!

     (gfx, 12/97).

Venus Art was a Polish demo group with considerable success in their native
land. The group was declared dead in december 1997, as announced in their
winner demo at Astrosyn 97, "Everything Dies".
  1997 - At Intel Outside, they released the winning 64k intro "Grotesque"
[07/97], and announced in an enclosed text file that graphician Juma
(08/96-) had been kicked due to laziness. They also released BJSebo's 4k
intro "Nameless", originally planned for Symposium that year which they
ultimately did not attend, the at the same party, despite the fact that the
amiga 4k competition was cancelled.
  1998 - Noe returned after three months in the army in march or april, and
is now working on new productions. Despite claiming that "Everything Dies"
would be their last release, they were back at Rush Hours 98 in april with
several productions. The 64k intro "Born Again" (let's hope they mean that
=) got to 2nd position in the competition, while the release of the very
first powerpc demo - a remix of their own classic "Everything Dies" -
secured their position as scene innovators.

  5th in the Intel Outside 95 demo competition.
  review: Nothing special about this demo, the only standout part is the
  'monitor' one. Here you see a virtual Amiga monitor on the left side,
  where someone loads an assembler, opens a file, runs it - and you're
  presented to some Goraud objects. Also, a lit candle lighting a face is
  seen in the same context, and that was very well executed. The music is
  nothing special, neither are the graphics. Average. Will run fine on
  unexpanded A1200's.

  review: This 4k intro involves several objects flying across a sky blue
  background. I'm still amazed at how they managed to store all those
  objects' coordinates in 4k! Another cool thing about this one is that
  it's actually quite system friendly - you can flip between screens while
  viewing it!! Outstanding, and only bettered by the winner intro "HazMix"
  this year. The text file mentions the intro 'should' work on unexpanded
  A1200's, but that 030 or better is recommended. It requires SetPatch.

  review: Nothing outstanding atmosphere-wise, though the effects are of an
  overall high quality. They present us with lots of envmapped objects
  here, as well as a tunnel effect similar to the one in Rebels' "Whammer
  Slammer" [12/94] demo, only a lot more colorful. Not bad. Not bad at all!
  They strongly recommend a 030 processor.

  complete source code for this intro was released.

  Winner of the Gravity 96 demo competition!
  Cooperation with Appendix.
  review: "Zero Gravity" deserved to win, from what I've seen from these
  competitions. While Floppy's "PapadeO" was good too, this has a lot more
  going on; a lot more substance. And, with an archive of 3.6mb, it should.
  The best of parts are towards the end, with the voxelspace landscape and
  the 'spaceships in space' parts. Also, the music is at its best there and
  at the very beginning. There are four fullscreen pictures in the demo,
  three by Neuromancer and one raytraced by Madbart. Other than that,
  there's not much new here, it's the usual shading and mapping. On a scale
  from 1 to 10, this is a strong 6.
    The demo requires 'some fast', and an 030 or better is strongly
  recommended. It also supports multitasking, so you can flip between
  screens with Amiga-M. 'Waiting for PowerPC'. So do I :)

  code: Noe, BJSebo, gfx: BJSebo (3d), music: Timer/Appendix (The Player

  review: After a few moments of precalculation, the intro opens with an
  object first splintering and then forming the words "Venus Art". An
  impressive twisting lava-textured object is next, then a fish in what is
  probably supposed to be an underwater setting. The intro jerks quite a bit
  sometimes, this is probably due to its multitasking capabilities... Not
  really sure what to call the next object, which is then relieved by a
  simplistic 3d scene with some dubious palette choices... Then the end text
  with credits flashes onto the screen while the scene keeps spinning in the
  background. The 3d effects on offer here are reasonable, but not amng the
  best I have seen, and the intro's power seems to be lessened by its
  multitasking capabilities... This intro was meant for 040 or 060 owners
  with graphics cards, and should probably be viewed in that setting in
  order to extract maximum appreciation.
    With this intro, coders Noe and BJSebo announced their intention to make
  all their future demos and intros system friendly, multitasking and
  supporting the CyberGraphX system. The intro will work on any 020+
  machine, but the authors recommend at least 030. They also write 8MB fast
  ram as a requirement, but that it SHOULD work with 4MB... if anyone can
  test this for me, then please let me know! The enclosed text file
  announced that Juma was kicked for being lazy.

  review: this intro was originally planned for Symposium, which Venus Art
  eventually didn't attend. They therefore finished it for Intel Outside 4,
  where the amiga 4k competition was cancelled =( In light of this, they
  then decided to just release it at the party place and be done with it...
  The intro itself is nothing special really, just a series of (gouraud?)
  shaded objects in the usual Venus Art lack of palette sense... =( As usual
  with Venus Arts' productions, this intro multitasks.

  review: After a system check and a considerable precalc period, we are
  launched into an intro that shows some competent coding, as well as some
  EXTREMELY bad palette choices! Are you trying to make us sick, Venus Art!?
  Jeesus, those sickly greens were a little much... Anyway! =) My machine is
  clearly not the ideal configuration, this jerks a little too much to be
  very enjoyable under my configuration... The intro consists mostly of
  scenes and objects, with an abundance texture/bump/phong/envmaps applied
  to every surface...though they REALLY need to get a graphician in there
  and do some better textures! 3d scenes are not the best, they mostly look
  cliched. The coding here is clearly competent, but I do believe I've been
  spoilt on too many Antibyte/Scoopex intros lately, and hey... these guys
  are nowhere in THAT neighbourhood!
    The intro requires at least 020 and 8MB of fast mem, but the producers
  recommend at least 040-40 or preferably a 060 processor for maximum
  pleasure. Please note that the version reviewed is the fixed version, with
  CGX support (unlike the party version). The intro supports multitasking.

  review: "Everything Dies" is a beautiful demo. With this production,
  Venus Art announce their farewell to the scene - but they certainly
  decided to go out with a bang! This demo singlehandedly take on the task
  of bringing the Amiga demo scene to the next step of the evolution ladder
  by bringing the fourth dimension into the 3d demo. There's stuff here
  that's unbelieavable, lifelike, and technically outstanding. Another
  thing that this demo does to push the limits is its support of the AHI
  and CyberGraphX standards for sound and video. This demo is a worthy
  tombstone on Venus Art's grave... DOWNLOAD IMMEDIATELY!
    Though the demo worked fine on my machine, it was unbearably slow.
  In fact, I believe this is the most processor hungry demo I have ever had
  the opportunity to run. Don't get me wrong, this isn't all bad; it's the
  kind of demo that makes you want to go out and buy an accelerator :)
  The recommended minimum configuration is 040-40, eventhough it will run
  on anything from 020 up. Neuromancer and Madd's pictures were the same
  ones as the ones they competed in the graphics competition with.
  The AmiNet archive also included the source code for their earlier intro
  "Oops!" [11/96] as a gift to the scene!

Vertigo (1990-)
---------------
FIN> Apache (ex Image, new 11/90), Apol, Braggart (sysop 'CONCEALED
     DIMENSION'), Delorean (founder music, later Complex, 08/90), Eddie,
     Mel, Mig, Nimrod (Jukka Airaksinen, swap, 91), Ripper (founder), Sulky
     Fellow (founder code, 08/90).
USA> Rowdy Roddy Piper (sysop 'PIPER'S PIT' WHQ).

Vertigo was a finnish demo group, born ca 07/90 by Sulky Fellow, Drifter,
Delorean, Unknown Artist and Ripper from Image. They released their first
demo "Vectors For All" (08/90, Sulky Fellow/Drifter/Delorean) shortly after,
finishing 3rd in a finnish party. They were joined by another member of
their old group Image in november, when Apache joined.
  They are now dead, since all their members left for other groups. It is
believed that Finnish musician Delorean moved directly to Complex.

Vertigo split up, and finnish graphician and founder Drifter (08/90) joined
  Byterapers.
Finnish graphician and founder Unknown Artist joined Omega.
Paralysis, sysop 'PARANOIA' joined Recline.
American sysop Spy Hunter ('INTERNAL AFFAIRS') joined TRSI.
American sysop Steve (old handle Bassmaster, 'MYSTIC PLACES') joined
  Anarchy.

  code: Sulky Fellow, gfx: Drifter, music: "Snow-Runner" by Delorean (4ch
  MOD format). 3rd in the Byterapers, Scoopex, Extasy Party 90 demo comp.
  review: Almost the last word in vector demos is this, the first ever demo
  from Vertigo. And guess what? They didn't come off to too bad a start!
  The unusual music works remarkably well, as does their 'widescreen'
  approach to demo design. Nice.
    There's no exit routine. Even though it runs on the A1200 with KillAGA,
  there's still some graphical errors here and there.

· Burntro (1993, ECS Intro).
  Code: Flash, Gfx: Solid (logo), Zorlac/Desire (font), Music: Strike.
  Review: What strikes you first, of course, is the music. It's a funky
  affair that's just smashing. Way to go! The intro itself is nothing
  especially interesting, consisting of just one screen and one effect.
  The effect, though, was brand new when I saw it. It's a sort-of burning
  cube that flies from left to right and back again :) Of course, flame
  effects have progressed a lot since then. Anyway, nice.

When Black Robes died, Dr.Skull (later just Skull), Tsunami, Alien, Groo
and Dr.Death decided to form a new group; Virtual Dreams. VD was originally
the demo and intro division of cracker group Fairlight, but as their Amiga
activities decreased, VD were more and more left on their own. Their first
demo, "Absolute Inebritation" was released at The Party 92.
  These days, most of VD are inactive on the scene, though most are for a
reason. Star coders Skull and Tsunami are working at Scavenger in the UK,
coding games. BTW, Skull also coded the MPEG animation player for the ASM96
CD-ROM "eRAVE 2", which means he's moved over to coding the PC now.
  Diskmags have been responsible for some erroneous information in the
past; RAW 5, released in mid 93, claimed that Tsunami left the scene, which
anyone who saw him win the intro competition at The Party 3 with
"Chaosland" (12/93) will know is untrue. Then, in RAW6 they claimed he had
joined Damones, which is also untrue. The truth was that he doublejoined.
ROM6 then devoted an entire article to he fact that the entire group was
officially disbanded after The Party 5, which is strange since they managed
to win the demo competition at Assembly 6 eight months later...
  Devilstar's BBS 'BODYCOUNT' was closed when he moved away from Denmark.
These days he's back in Copenhagen, as ROM9 revealed, and working on games
for interactive television! The ROM article revealed he was considering
doing some work for the scene again, and we certainly hope he will!
In the meantime, he has worked on game projects such as Full Throttle (pc),
Targa (snes), Battle Tech (pc), War Inc (pc), Imperium Romanum (pc), Earth-
worm Jim 1 and 2 (pc) and Hugo (TV and PC).
  I found one ad for 'CHILD IN TIME' where one of the sysop names were
Immortal instead of Eternal. Perhaps this means he used/has a different
handle at one time.

Nitch (code) joined Artwork.
Dutch swapper Astro (Casper van Schie, ex Movement and CNCD, new ROM4) took
  a big step when he took over the editor job of legendary diskmag "R.A.W".
  He then joined VD, and everything looked hunky-dory... Then, as we all
  know, the diskbased "R.A.W" was terminated in favour of I-GO's "R.A.W
  Online", and Astro left the scene to run his own InterNet company.
The Dutch superteam Facet and SuperNao (new 05/95-12/95) came to VD from
  Spaceballs, because they found them to be inactive...but soon after they
  joined, all production pretty much ceased in VD too! Therefore they
  decided to revive their old group Lemon. right after The Party 5!
Finnish coder Zany (ex Complex, new SLH11, 08/93-95) has sold his Amiga.
  Zany worked on "242" (08/93).
Hungarian graphician D-Mage (Ferenc Tompai, ex Headway, 08/93-94) sold his
  Amiga in early 1995.
Swedish musician Probe has lost contact with the group sometime around
  early 1995, and has presumably left the scene.

· Assembly 94 Invitation (1994, AGA Intro).
  Code: Alien, Gfx: Jaco, Music: Groo/CNCD.
  Review: This opens with a picture by Jaco of a yellow-tinted female face.
  It's slowly faded onto the screen, and then there's some text overlayed
  onto it. The proportions are way off on the face; perhaps this is
  intended, since the large eyes and the weird nose give her a sort of
  elfquest feel...
    The main part of the intro is a text selector, with a rotation zoomer
  in the background. The graphics tiles of the rotzoomer changes frequently,
  and consists of fruit and weird female pop stars :) The music is Groo.
  Can't be put much more precise than that, I'm afraid...

  Review: A very nicely designed intro with only two real routines, though
  they're both very good. The first is a ripple/bitmap distortion routine
  they let loose on a B&W pic of a cute kitten, and the second is "James
  Gouraud". James is a man-like animated object that swims through a sea,
  among other things. A good intro this, no doubt about that.

· Sumea - Faktory 2 (1996, 18.08, AGA HD Multifile).
  Code^Music: Alien, Gfx: Jaco.
  Winner of The Assembly 96 demo competition!
  Review: This is not a demo. It is a piece of art! In this amazing
  production, Alien has perhaps created what is the first real piece of
  demo art. An amazing achievement is what this is. There are several good
  routines on offer, of course, but what sets this apart from the crowd has
  got to be the way there all FOR something, they're not just another
  component in the demo. From the moment that tunnel explodes onto the
  screen, you know you're in for a ride. The music has a certain groove to
  it, something I sorely miss in most productions these days. A worthy
  winner. Alien calls it 'what Faktory was supposed to be'. Recommended?
  You bet your grandmother! It does not mention at all whether it requires
  any fastmem, but I suspect it does ;)

  Code: Capt.Zbig, Gfx: Fatman, Acid, Music: "Chiptech1" by Doctor/Skulls.
  Made for the Intel Outside II 64k intro competition.
  Review: This intro scores high on some originality, and has a few points
  deducted for the generic techno chiptune. The result lies somewhere
  above middle ground. The intro opens with a texturemapped box with the
  Escom and Intel Outside logos mapped onto the sides! The box then mutates
  a little before we move on to a spinning texture world globe. Then we get
  to the original part; a yellow butterfly is 'afterburned', and flies
  around a flower in the middle of the screen. This is a little hard to
  describe, but was very nice. The best effect of the intro is up next,
  when we travel down a dark blue corridor. This looks really nice at first
  look, and lifts the intro as a whole a little for me! Overall? Not bad.

Vision was originally a dutch demo group, probably formed in 1989 (at least
that's when their first productions were released). 1989 saw the release of
no less than two megademos from this young group, as well as some minor
productions. The following year would see a massive amount of releases being
poured out, before they presumably died in early 1992. Only one production
was released that year, the Anarchy cooperation slideshow "Focused On Art".
  1990 - German Malzam (ex Paranoimia) made a very quick stop around july
before moving on to the new group Angels.

Norwegian coder and trader Face The Facts (old handle Octoplex, ex Dual

  his scene career. His previous groups were Gate, Anarchy, Palace and
  Spirit.

  group. This may be Angels new.
Auqa/Addonic joined, but left for Surprise! Productions a few weeks later.
German sysops Sniffy and Helioth ('SPIRITUAL HEALING', ex Alpha Flight,

  RAW3) left to form a new crew with some Swedish guys (RAW3).
Twister (sysop 'FLASHBACK', new RAW3) joined from Agile, but later sold
  all his gear to Kevin Key, who is now running it (RAW3).
Amitech (sysop 'THE PHANTOM ZONE', new RAW3) and Lion (ex New Wave, new

  (07/89-09/91) joined Anarchy. Coder Crackerjack (08/90) joined the
  original Axis.
Norwegians Octoplex, Mindblaster and Flash joined Dual Crew. Mindblaster and
  Flash then joined Scoopex, only to return to Vision (RAW1). Octoplex also
  later returned, using his new handle Face The Facts.
Finnish Starfader changed his handle to Mellow D and joined Miranda 12/90.

  there's also a scroller and some equalizers. Not too exciting. Please
  note that no actual credits appear in the intro, so I'm just assuming New

  code: TSM, gfx: Facet (font), Hein Design (font 2), music: Dutch Usa Team
  (Music Assembler format, 7724 bytes, 1 subsong).  Cooperation with Mirage.
  info: The music credit seems dubious (the D-USA Team was a c64 group,
  famous for creating the music editor RockMonitor on that platform), it is
  possibly a cover version? There was a Venlo Meeting on this date, and it
  was probably released there... It is more uncertain exactly what party
  this intro is supposed to invite to... I can find no reference to a 1991
  copy party in 'Tilburg', and no others that match either :(

  review: This one opens with a DEAD COOL logo by Hein, and continues with a
  nicely designed opening sequence...setting the scene for one of the best
  little demos of 1991!

. Violation Packmenu (1991?, ECS Intro).
  code: TSM, gfx: Hein Design, music: n/a (NoisePacker 1/2 format).
  review: This is a real nice, though non-innovative packmenu produced by
  the dutch members of Vision, though the pack itself was released by the
  Norwegians. A bouncy scroll is at the lower half of the screen, and the
  rest is occupied by the selector menu - overlaid over a 'skrå'-moving
  Vision logo. The music for the version reviewed is uncredited, but is a
  chippy with a nice melody. The overall impression of the menu is very
  good, with good clear graphics. There are some compatibility problems,
  though - on my machine, the selector graphics were not displayed, though
  the intro itself worked perfectly! When it was run from WB with KillAGA,
  it worked perfectly (selector graphics and all), but destabilized my
  system upon exit, resulting in a guru shortly after. Reviewed is the menu
  for Violation #69 (released at Razor and Imp 666's 'Arendal' party,
  29.09-91).

  Illegal Copy issue #1 (1991, 23.05, ECS Diskmag).

· Intro (1991, 06.11, ECS Intro).
  Code: X-Ion, Gfx: Baileys, Music: Saracen.
  Review: This intro, simple as it is, is quite OK. It's got a sort of C64
  feel to it, what with the logo and the type of design. It's just a large
  logo with a 3D starfield behind it, and a scroller towards the bottom.
  The different sections are divided by color-scroll lines. I like it!
  Made to announce some new members.

Falcons) joining the new group.

Danes Poseidon and Apollon left.

  BoogeySon (1992).

. Deliverance Packmenu (1992, late.08, ECS Intro).
  code: Razta/Orient, gfx: Drain/Orient, music: HiLite/Scoopex.
  review: Deliverance has a pretty unexciting packmenu, which though
  fuctional, is still far from state of the art. The bottom part of the
  screen has a blue/white wavy scroller, while the entire rest of the
  screen is occupied by a text/demo selector with a Vixen logo as part of
  the display on the left side. The entire thing is done in shades of blue
  and grey. The pack editor is Declan.

  Review: This is just an intro for a demopack they did. Nothing cool.
  There was no graphics credit, and given how it looks I guess that's just
  as well. They improved, needless to say.
