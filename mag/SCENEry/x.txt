  review: If I was astounded by the lack of change from issue 8 to issue 9,
  I'm AMAZED by the fact that this issue is - you guessed it - graphically
  identical to the two next issues! The intro picture (a dragon this time)
  seems to be only thing that's different... Contentwise, I found this
  issue to be a bit more SCENE than the next two, with a real news section
  and other related articles. Some interesting stuff here, especially I
  would imagine, if you're a coder! The whole thing seems a little 'thin'
  though, and you read through it in a jiffy. There is one quite serious
  bug, though: It doesn't make a sound! On my machine, it seems unable to
  play a single note...
    The intro is really worth a mention. It doesn't require AGA, but seems
  to benefit from extra machine power. What it is, essentially, is a series
  of graphics twirl effects, with an upscroller overlaid. There are some
  great effects here, and the intro doesn't occupy more than 64k!

  review: When reading this review, remember that I read this issue
  immediately AFTER reading #9 :) What strikes me the most is the fact
  that these two issues - though separated by a full year - are graphically
  100% the same. No new panel, no new code. What's changed is a different
  intro picture, and some different background tiles. Still, I found this
  issue to be better, actually. Having read both of them, I feel like maybe
  Blitter wasn't in as much contact with the scene during 1996 as he was in
  1995. Either way, I find the articles in this issue a lot more
  interesting to read. Quality is excellent, so there's not much else to
  say. You know what you're getting!

  review: Having just read the entire TJ9, from beginning to end, I have a
  few observations to share. TJ seems like the minimalist's approach to a
  diskmag; not much flashy stuff, but what's there works well. Graphically
  it looks a little like Upstream, with its tiled background. The multi-
  tasking code should be optimized, I think - it's slightly unresponsive,
  even on the 030. Marc's mag tune deserves special mention, as it's one of
  the best guitar tunes I've heard in a long while. Really realistic sound!
  Article design in TJ is nice, with good contrast between letters and the
  background. The TJ homepage is announced, at http://pc23-c801.uibk.ac.at/
  ~blitter/welcome.htm.
    Contentwise, what strikes me is that there's not a lot of articles
  about the scene as such here, are there? Many of the articles are more
  or less totally scene-unrelated, and the ones that are seem to launch
  into endless dialogues with themselves over seemingly trivial issues.
  There's no traditional demo reviews, 'making of' articles, interviews...
  not even real news! In one way, this is good, since it means The Jungle
  has a distinct style of its own. Ofcourse, you can't do anything but
  respect Blitter for trying to be different in a diskmag scene that's all
  too often stagnant! Because TJ is released as seldomly as it is (once a
  year), you can forgive Blitter for not concentrating on things like news.
  After all, there are enough magazines out there to deal with things like
  that. TJ seems to concentrate more on the philosophy of the scene than on
  hard facts. Originality is its strength! Don't change a thing, Blitter.
    It's highly doubtful if Wolf was still a member when this mag was
  released; he was a member of Wrath Designs at Assembly 96, and worked on
  their demo "Gyrate"...

X-Zone was the new name given to the Italian group Ozon in late 95.

Italian coder and main organizer Modem (12/96) joined Ram Jam. He was one
  of the original founders of X-Zone.
Italian musician Lord was kicked due to inactivity

· Over (1996, 28.12, 40k Intro).
  code: Modem, Washburn, gfx: Lanch, music: Corrosion.
  Released for The Party 96 40k intro competition, unplaced.
  review: Perhaps a little too short, this is nevertheless an ok 40k'er.
  Corrosion's techno-flavoured music creeps under your skin, and the use of
  bumpmapping is unusual - originality is always a plus! They could have
  used some less extreme colours though, especially for the bumpmap and the
  envmap routine - there is simply too much contrast for it to look nice.
  Two effects is not enough for a 40k intro.
