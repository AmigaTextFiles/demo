The old Eclipse is little-known, and all that the group ever amounted to
was releasing a few cracks from Rasta Catcha. There is no relation to the

  intro is the faked Guru meditation towards the end. I guess the name of
  the intro should have given me some kind of hint as to why it suddenly
  'crashed', but oh no. I was totally fooled and for that alone this one
  deserves a star. Too bad the rest of thing sucks horses... isn't good.

Elevation was an illegal crew that was (I believe) relatively shortlived.
After failing to release anything for a while, the whole group decided to
call it quits. They released an intro to announce the fact in late 93.
  1993 - Swedish Striker joined Submission early 93.

  vector and a text plotter. It was not made to impress, just to tell the
  world the news that Elevation died. The release date is based on the

  code: Manta, Slat, Dip (additional), gfx: Mat/Vrn, Rio, Manta
  (additional), Slat (additional), Vision-X/Degeneration (additional),
  music: Parsec. 5th in the Mekka Symposium 97 demo competition.
  review: "Smart" is short but sweet, with good effects and excellent
  design. It opens with an atmospheric intro sequence, with a 'motion
  blurred starfield', over which the credits are overlayed. The combination
  of this and the stringbased music at this point makes it remind me of
  the intro sequence for Andromeda's mindblasting "Nexus 7" [12/94]!
    It continues with a travel down a bumpmapped triangle tunnel, some very
  colorful truecolor 'motionblurring crossfade' and 1x1 18bit truecolor
  bumpmapping! The strengths of "Smart" lies in two things; its superior
  design and its effort to push the limits of resolution and color.
  Ofcourse, Parsec's commercial quality techno soundtrack is no drawback
  either! However, its length is also a small drawback...a demo that
  doesn't last more than a little while is not a party winner. If this is
  anything to go by, then I expect E11 to produce a truly great piece of
  demo entertainment sometime soon!
    Multifile is a little misleading, as it's just a small executable and
  a large data file. Though it will work on all 020+ AGA machines, it
  requires at least 030-25 to maintain effect synchronisation.

· Back In Town (1998, AGA 4MB 030 Multifile Demo).
  code: Sly, gfx: Sly, Bass-Cadet, music: Bass-Cadet.
  review: Annoyingly, this is one of those demos with an every-other-pixel
  c2p routine... No matter what anyone says, it will never look as good as
  solid objects. Having said that, this is not an ALL bad demo, though there
  is little in the way of groundbreaking effects (they do the standard
  phong/bump-stuff), there is a certain level of competence evident. With
  some better pacing, more handpixeled graphics, and a better slightly
  better sense of what makes a demo work, these guys could go places. The
  music is of very variable quality. Bass-Cadet's graphics are mostly of the
  raytraced variety. OK then, but a little way to go yet.
    I was unsuccessful at trying to run this from RAM, but once I ran from
  HD with no startup-sequence, it worked wonderfully.

· Fecha (1997, 14.12, AGA ?MB File).
  6th in the Astrosyn 97 demo competition.
  review: Sadly, "Fecha" is a demo that's more occupied with showing us
  endless reruns of the same rendered spaceships/grabbed rollercoaster
  ride than treating us to anything innovative or interesting. I'm sorry,
  Embora, but this didn't manage to hold my attention for very long.
  The good news is: The only way is up! OK, this is not BADLY done, it's
  just that I feel it doesn't have much of interest for me as a casual
  viewer. If it had shown all its animations just ONCE, and ran about 30
  seconds, it would have gotten a much better rating!
    This requires some fastmem, though the exact amount is uncertain.
  Judging by the fact that I had to reboot to run it, should give you
  some idea...

  new. I've heard the music before, so it's probable that it's just ripped
  and used here because they didn't have a musician. No release date

Endzeit is a German-based demo group built on the ashes of what used to be
Germany's #1 group, Artwork. It was formed by Damion, RokDaZone and Noogman
shortly after the death of Artwork in april of 1998. Also italian writer The
Ripper joined up to continue his work for the diskmag "Generation".
  They soon also built a strong Swedish section, recruiting members from
Subspace and Session. They also did the masterpiece of recruiting TWO
members called Blaze, both the Polish swapper and the Swedish coder!

Energy was originally based in Austria. When the group Prime died, Storm
and most other members joined Energy (EuroChart #11). When Growl joined from
Orient, his cheatdisks went along with him, and will from now on be released
under the Energy label... Then Growl suddenly left, and I don't know what
happened to the disks!
  Internal problems split the group into two parts; legal and illegal. All
graphicians stayed with the illegal part, and all the best members of the
legal section will probably join other groups or rebuild Quartex. When
Dr.Grell joined from TRSI (mid 94) he rebuilt the illegal part of Energy,
and became the world modem organizer for the group.
  "Analtro" [02/94] announced MBD's plans to open 'THE FUNNY FARM' BBS,
but there's no information if there was ever any opening. Zoro (trade) has
never been a member, even though he has claimed to be. At one time, now
famous Austrian coder Antibyte was a member; he is now the leader of
Scoopex.
  1990 - Stranger coarranged the Energy Chaos Party in Austria in june with
members of Chaos (c64).
  1991 - Commander X got kicked mid 91. Austrian Perseus left to join a PD
group mid 91. Blackstar, sysop 'DARK CENTURY', joined The Silents mid 91.
Optimize, sysop of 'UNITY FIELDS' left mid 91, and joined Legend. Belgian
sysops of 'METAL IMPACT', Mad Shitbrain (aka Maddy, new mid 91) and TCB (ex
Destiny), both left to join Agile. Junkfood changed his name to Candyman and
joined Scoopex mid 91. Another source claimed he joined Legend, but this
seems to be untrue - or at least something that happened later. Austrian
cracker Stranger left the scene for a while to work on a game, late in the
year.
  1995 - Polish swapper Action joined Mad Elks late 95.

Storm (ex Prime, new late91) and Slider joined Awesome.

Wild Rage got kicked, and left the scene. Therefore there will never be any

Ephidrena is a Norwegian demo group.

2001 in april, where also Frequent contributes a tune to Contraz' 64k intro
"1 Week".

· Mnemonic (1996, 16.11, AGA 4MB Multifile).
  code: Cyberstarr, Loaderror, gfx: Loaderror, Cheetah, music: "Senseless"
  by Frequent (The Player 6.1A format).
  2nd in the Kindergarden 6 demo competition.
  review: By no means exceptional, "Mnemonic" does show some promise for
  the future of this young Norwegian group. Slow effects mean that the
  coders need to do some work on their routines, but after all I guess
  this is true for most coders :). Also the design of the demo leaves a
  little to be desired, but it will come with time and experience. The best
  effect here - for its originality alone - is a shadebob-like caleidoscope
  effect which is truly psychedelic. Frequent's music is nothing
  exceptional. It's been two minutes since I exited the demo, and I can't
  even remember the melody :( Bad news for any composer.
   The exit routine crashed in the competition since it was crunched
  with StoneCracker.

· Adam Malysz (2000, .04, AGA HD Multifile Demo).
  producers: Loaderror, Cheetah, Zixaq, Frequent.
  4th in the Mekka Symposium 2000 demo competition.
  review: "Adam Malysz" is a very bleak, dark and industrial demo. It's more
  about its ambience and atmosphere than about its effects, we feel. At
  times it seems a little split in perspective though, with one part being
  the dark, dirty cyberpunky style and the next still dark and dirty, but
  with more of an...eastern bloc feel to it, if anyone understands that.
  From neo-tech to old and sad. A lot of effort has obviously gone into the
  design of the backdrops in other graphics in this demo, much more than has
  gone into the coding and music. It feels like the coder's reusing the same
  routines several times here, with minor variations. Most effects are in
  shades of grey too, which doesn't help much. The music is not good either,
  I can get a feel for what they were going for, but not quite get there. I
  can't quite put my finger on it, but I feel this demo is not all it could
  be. It just didn't get me excited. Well, at least it worked on my old
  workhorse, which is more than I can say for Floppy's demo at this party =]
    The demo requires setpatch before it will run. No exact credits appear
  anywhere in the demo or in the archive. Naturally this requires some fast,
  but how much is anyone's guess.

100% certain that the board Rioter sysop's is 'TOTAL OVERDOSE', it's just
my conclusion based on elimination.
  1991 - Dragnet sold his Amiga and bought a synth 09/91. The French section
was kicked out late 91. Coder Wilderness left the Amiga scene late 91.
Master Freez joined The Special Brothers late 91. French sysop Captain Kirq
had a visit from the Police, and therefore found it safest to close his
board and leave the scene late 91. Enigma, Imperator, Maverick, Skyhawk,
Starwars, Stormbringer, The Ace, The Invisible and Zorlac were all kicked
late 91. Finnish musician Stargazer joined from The Special Brothers 09/91,
but was back within 2 months (tsb member again 11/91). Finnish sysop Dope
('MOTOWN') left between 10 and 11/91.
  1992 - The Finnish section left to form a new group called Stellar in

  review: Graphically appealing, the swedish answer to the Eurochart is at
  first look a competent little mag. The first thing you'll think, however,
  is definitely that this looks a lot like the Eurochart... There's the
  obligatory charts, a gallery section and the mag part. The biggest
  difference, parhaps, is that this one is a little more geared towards the
  illegal part of the scene. The magpart is fair, and about par with the
  later releases of the EC.

  review: Well, Eremation are certainly right when they announce that
  this is the first diskmag that's BORN DEAD. They announce that this is
  both the first and the last issue to be released! First impressions
  are quite good, with design that's subtly different, nice clipart and
  a colorful title picture.
    Now for some serious criticism: What the fuck's the point of making
  your mag multitask if it's gonna take ALL of your rastertime, probably
  using some infinite loop that keeps eating those cycles!? This is the
  height of idiocy. All the good things about a system friendly mag such
  as this - useless. For the record, RAGE! means Review All Great
  Events. Yeah, and use all the goddamn rastertime no matter what
  processor we're running on. RAGE!AUATGRNOMPWRO!

  review: Erotic delivers an intro of acceptable quality, with some fine

  off from Enter a little, seeing as the effects he presented here were most
  hot three years or more ago... Get this for Cooper's work, though - it's
  top notch!
    The intro seems to leave the system back badly; after exiting the intro
  my machine guru'ed after a few seconds. The intro was the first thing I
  ran, after booting up, so there's no doubt who the culprit was.

Essence was formed by several ex-Delicious members. Their two biggest
assets are probably their coder Touchstone, and their diskmag ROM and its
editor Mop. Mop joined from Alcatraz in february 1994 since he wasn't
content with the way the diskmag he was editor for there, Compass, was
heading. The first issue of ROM was released in August of 1994. Nowadays
Mop also volunteers time as a coeditor of the PC diskmag Imphobia, from
issue #12 onwards.
  1995 - Around the middle of the year, they recruited german musician
Blackthorne from TRSI, who soon changed his handle to Poldi and contributed
music to ROM #5 - the very issue where his joining was announced.
  1996 - After persuading two famous artists of times past (musician Chromag
and graphicians Gfx-Twins) to return to the scene under their wings during
1996 they have strengthened their German section considerably. They further
boosted their abilities with the recruitment of the entire Skarla crew from
France. Their demo "Makaveli" reached the second place at The Party 1996,
which was the highest placing of an Essence demo ever. Having lost them
some time later, we can still say they played an important part in building
Essence's good name.
  1997 - The end of 1997 saw Essence recruiting their first ever Spanish
members; the two remaining active guys from the old Spanish group Goblins.
These two simultaneously joined Network, to still have roots in the Spanish
scene.
  1999 - Touchstone contributed to Haujobb's winning demo "Mnemonics"
[04/99] at the Mekka Symposium 2k-1.

Swedes Frame (gfx) and Origo (code) ended their double memberships, and
  withdrew back to C-Lous late97/early98, since they felt they could not
  contribute anything to the group.
After releasing their last demo for Essence, "Thug Life" [03/97] the four
  frenchmen Horus (3D), Jamie (code), Marvin (music) and Norm (gfx) decided
  to join Mystic (ROM9). The four had joined from Skarla, and also released
  the memorable demo "Makaveli" [12/96] for Essence.
German swapper Elric (Carsten Henkelmann, ex Speedhawk/Rebels) left the
  scene.
German coder-raytracer Cueball (Dirk Jager) joined from Rebels with Excess,
  but soon after decided to leave the Amiga scene for the PC.
German coder team Zulu & Grey (ex Rebels) left. After a few months of scene
  inactivity they joined Crux Design.
Dutch coder Infant (ex Facet's Pussy/Desire) and the Norwegians Christian
  Meland (music sysop 'DREAMSTATE'/'ENIGMA' WHQ, doublememb Spaceballs) and
  Tim were asked to leave the group. This means that the only non-German
  member is now Mop. This would later change, of course. Anyone know what
  happened to the third Norwegian, coder Sunjammer? Infant joined Session
  12/95.
German musician Andy (Andreas Dubois, ex Nuance, 12/94-95) decided to leave
  the Amiga scene to concentrate more on his career as a musician in
  Anarchy PC. He was news editor of ROM upto issue #5. Years later, in late
  1997, he returned to the Amiga as a member of his old group Nuance.
Main organizer P$ aka Powerswap (S. Paschart, ex Delicious) has decided to
  leave the scene. Touchstone is the new organizer.
German graphicians D-Sign (ex The Silents, 12/93-94) and the Gfx-Twins
  (Calvin Golowski and Arthur Skotnik, ex Universal Soldiers, 95-96) left
  the scene in favour of game graphics). This is not strictly true anymore,
  since the Gfx-Twins have now made a comeback in Scoopex!
Covert Action Team [CAT] (Groo and Rufferto, 12/93) and musician Dascon,
  all ex Delicious, decided to leave the scene. Ofcourse, Rufferto's work
  lives on in the form of the ROM fonts... :) Dascon regained scene
  inspiration in late 97, and rejoined Essence after a short stay in Iris!
German celebrity graphician Fade One (Martin Sauter, ex Lego, new 94) left
  the scene.
German coder Roman (Roman Kaczmarczyk, ex Agnostic Front, 12/93) left the
  scene. Roman worked on "Cardiac Arrest" [92] and "A.S.S." [93].

        music: "ROM Theme" by Dascon, "Weird Personalities" by
        Lizardking/Razor 1911, rditor: Mop.
  review: ROM kicks off in style, with three fabulous full screen
  pictures from the Covert Action Team (CAT), and a suitably heavy tune
  to accompany a kickin' intro. The mag itself doesn't do much worse,
  opening with a great lego man by D-Sign.
    The first picture seen in the intro is called "Ambush", already
  released once before, for the graphics competition at The Party 3.
  There, it was released under the fictious name of Artcore/Essence,
  since CAT had already delivered one picture for the competition
  (S.E.X, which came 6th). "Ambush" came 40th. Lizardking's tune "Weird
  Personalities" was later re-used in the Razor 1911 musicdisk "Memorial
  Songs II' [01/95].
    A kickdown to KS 1.3 was required to get the mag working on my
  setup. After this, the mag worked beautifully - without it, it didn't
  even get to the intro. The mag itself seems well coded, apart from a
  few obvious glitches here and there. I strongly doubt I have 717 MBytes
  of chip memory, Touchstone...and I _DO_ have an MMU, no matter what
  your mag says! The release date is an estimate, based on information
  contained in the mag.

  review: There's certainly nothing wrong with the audio-visuals of ROM 2.
  It opens with a stonking title picture by Fade One and legendary Uno,
  showing a rather offensive shark. Very nice. The tunes are all okay too,
  though Interphace's has the edge. VERY good, with a distinctive beat and
  a certain groove factor.

  Mop.
  review: The third issue of ROM was the first with a multitasking code.
  This meant an almost total recoding of the mag, and the first version
  released had several severe bugs, forcing Touchstone to release a fix
  soon after. Contentwise; ace. Graphically; ace. Musically: out of sp-ace.
    Though the package available on AmiNet does not contain it, the
  original release contained an intro by Sonik Clique. Mel'o'Dee's tune was
  previously released at the Doom's Day Party 94 competition. That version
  claimed a fixed version would be out later; maybe this tune is it?

  There's funny graphics, funny code and a fun tune. What more to say?
  Text synchronised to the (did I mention it was fun?) music indicate some

  BrainBug/Talent "Sincerely Yours", editor: Mop.
  review: This issue of ROM opens with a picture of a pig's face, no less!
  This one came out so soon after the last one, it's most probably a world
  record in release speed! Not much has changed in the looks department;
  due to popular demand they've even used the great, colorful control panel
  by Fade One a second time! The opening tune by Chromag is nice, calm and
  sounds very professional - especially the fill-ins sound cool. It's also
  a very nice gesture of the ROM team to allow a virtually unknown musician
  from the UK, TJM, contribute with a tune. "Majestic" is also a calm tune
  that creates a warm and fuzzy atmosphere. BrainBug delivers one of his
  trademark funky guitar tunes, which is also a winner! So overall, ROM
  scores top marks yet again in the audio-visual department.
    The contents of ROM4 are certainly up to the usual standard, and
  contain all the usual 'making of', news and debate articles.
  I particularly enjoyed the articles about TRSI's history, Artwork, and
  the making of Greenday. As usual, ROM is VERY Rewarding. The release date
  is approximate, based on things written in the mag.

  code: Touchstone, gfx: Fade 1, music: Chris Meland.
  3rd in the Somewhere In Holland 95 intro competition.
  review: A big disappointment, this, from a quality coder like Touchstone.
  It looks like it was put together in a real hurry, with not enough time
  to put the thing decently together. It's real short, with two digitized
  b&w pictures (both of which are totally unnecessary), and two effects; a
  voxel landscape (which I suspect is supposed to be Malta) and a tunnel/
  dungeon effect which could have been done MUCH better. I guess this was
  put together in honour of Mop, but I think Touchstone could have done him
  much better justice by not releasing it!

  Mop.
  review: This will sound like I'm repeating myself, but there's not really
  much to say about ROM except it's excellent as always. The articles are
  interesting, the music's cool (especially Postludium!) and the graphics
  are totally stunning! I'm constantly amazed by what Fade1 can do in so
  few colors... Looking at this mag, you can clearly see how he became one
  of the most respected painters out there!

  review: The first things that strikes you with the sixth issue of ROM is
  the nice title picture of men's faces carved in stone by TeeVaan, and the
  incredible groooove of Jam & Spoon's cool tune! It's so groovy, in fact,
  that it kept me from getting into the mag for the first couple of minutes
  just because I was busy listening! I actually have one slight thing that
  irritates me a little; the panel graphics in this issue is actually the
  worst they've ever had!

  review: This is a good intro, and it's not hard to see why it made it to

  strongest point. A good one.

  as usual. I just wanted to express how thrilled I am about the second
  module on this diskmag. Hooray, scene musician rediscovers funk and
  melody, puts intricate beat down in favour of a nice tune! Amazing!
  This almost makes all those soulless techno beats worth it.
    Ok, the mag itself. It's the same ROM, with the same quality articles.

  still quite a lot to sink your teeth into. What can I do with an issue of
  ROM but recommend it?

  review: An issue of ROM is always a pleasure to read, and this is
  certainly no exception. You can always find some interesting article
  here, and there's lots of relevant information for the Scenery editor
  to incorporate into his amazing little collection of text files... :)
  Seriously, the mag is very good. The code seems very system friendly,
  happily multitasking with the rest of my system. As a matter of fact,
  I'm running it in the background right now! Now, from the good to the bad
  of this system: The mag doesn't release the audio channels when you turn
  off the music, which means you can't run another player (HiP :) in the
  background, playing a tune of your choice. Unnecessary, Touchstone!
  The graphics are nice and functional, though not outstanding. I still
  remember the images that came with some of the early issues of R.A.W, and
  I doubt if I'll remember any of the images in ROM 8 in three years.
    There's three tunes to choose from, neither of which really held my
  interest. They're just my kind of music, but the excellent code doesn't
  make that a problem, so why am I complaining? The mag is laid out in such
  a way that it can just as easily be run from floppy as from your HD.
  There are two data files in addition to the main executable, which means
  that you place the second executable on a separate disk to run from
  floppy. To conclude, it's a very very good mag. It's strong points - the
  best articles - are the behind the scenes stuff, like Azazel talking
  about the music for Tint (he's right - the first tune does suck :) and
  the very knowledgable Sumaleth's graphics reviews. To my mind, he writes
  a whole lot more interesting than Facet ever did for R.A.W! But what am I
  keeping you for? Go download this from somewhere and leave me alone so I

· Virgill Dreams (1996, late, AGA 4MB Multifile Musicdisk, 3 disks).
  code: Touchstone, gfx: Phase, music: Virgill.
  review: If you're into some seriously weird heavy metal tunes, with a
  depressing touch, then this is the music disk for you. Those poems aren't
  exactly cheerful are they, Virgill? This is (AFAIK) Phase's first
  production for his new team. I know I'm certainly looking forward to his
  next one :) The best thing abou this musicdisk, though, is undoutedly
  the intro. It's nothing amazingly 'wow', but you can't do anything but
  bow your head to Touchstone's amazing env- and bumpmapping routines.
  Coolness doesn't half cover how great these look, but you get the idea :)
    After the intro is finished, the selector itself actually multitasks
  quite happily. To be quite honest, I'm running it in the background
  right now, listening to the tunes while I'm typing this. This is
  certainly the way to do it! VD can be run from floppy if so is desired.
  It is called a 'christmas present' in the info text, suggesting perhaps a
  december release?

· Makaveli (1996, 28.12, AGA File).
  code: Jamie, gfx: Norm, Horus, music: Marvin (The Player 6.1A format).
  2nd in The Party 96 demo competition.
  review: The impressive thing about "Makaveli" is its SPEED. Sure, we've
  seen objects shaded, mapped, raped and abused before, but never this
  fast! Geez, these objects FLY around the screen! It's rare to see such a
  good, advanced demo from someone you've never even heard of before - like
  these new Essence members. Another thinkg that strikes me is the palette
  choices. These objects are COLORFUL, and the same KIND of colors seem to
  go as a red thread throught the whole demo. Not the same colors as such,
  just similar, which gives it a specific athmosphere. An orange
  atmosphere, but still... Just some of the things you get to see is a high
  quality fullscreen zoomrotator with stretching, a colorful tunnel, about
  6 simultaneous spacecut Z-Buffer shaded objects and a couple of really
  cool objects that I haven't seen before, like a rabbit (thank god! If I
  ever see another yellow duck...) and a man-in-the-moon figure.
    The music is strange, but then again it would have to be. All good
  demos have music which is only classifiable by the guy who made it.
  It's tradition among Amiga demos, and it's been with us ever since the
  very first trackmo, Scoopex' "Mental Hangover". Oh god, that was a great
  tune... Ehrm, getting a little sidetracked here, ain't I? Anyway,
  Makaveli. It's good. Download it. I'm off to find the M.H. agafix.

        Car" by Revisq/Anadune, "Elixir" by Marvin/Mystic, "Somewhat Rusty"
        by Deelite/Balance, editor: Mop.
  review: Another issue of ROM is here, this time with an intro by C-Lous.
  It's a quite remarkable little intro, actually, since it almost success-
  fully combines the 'shaded object' intro with the 'art' intro! It can't
  really be described easily in my limited space, but it's got great, very
  unusual design and a fast envmapped object :) Know all you need to now?
  Oh, and Soul/Movement does the music - it's been QUITE SOME TIME since we
  heard from that Swedish musician! It's nice to know he's not abandoned us
  altogether...
    Then there's the mag itself, of course. The opening article by Mop has
  always got a wise word or two, and this one's no exception. His comments
  about the amiga scene are spot on, and I noticed we share a lot of the
  same thoughts about it. One thing that strikes me is how ROM now suddenly
  has 4 modules instead of 3 or 2... In my view this is unnecessary, and
  just eats disk space, especially when all 4 modules are as alike as they
  are here. All four have a jazzy feel to them, with warm fuzzy instruments.
  If I didn't know any better I'd think they were all by the same musician!
  Please note that I'm not complaining about the quality here, just the
  quantity :) Two modules should always be enough.
    Why doesn't a multitasking mag like ROM deallocate the audio channels
  when it's not playing anything? If you'd like to listen to some other
  music with HippoPlayer while reading the mag, you can't! From this issue
  on, ROM has a www presence at http://ROM.home.ml.org.

  code: Jamie, gfx: Norm, Horus, Momo, music: Marvin (2 tunes, The Player
  6.1A format). 3rd in the Mekka Symposium 97 demo competition.
  review: Jamie is back to prove that "Makaveli" (12/96) wasn't a one-off
  thing - and succeeds in style. "Thug Life" is even better than his
  previous demo, with large, fast 3d scenes and good music! There can be no
  doubt that Jamie's 3d routines are among the fastest on the scene. This
  demo REQUIRES a 030 processor, but the processor-specific optimizations
  also show. The 3d environments are further helped by some great textures,
  which give most objects a dirty, brown cyberpunky feel. "Thug Life" is
  professional in every respect, and should be in anyones collection.
  Simply great.

  the handling, since it's exactly the same as the one used in issue #13,

  review: This issue opens with a moody title picture by Odin/Illusion.
  I saw his slideshow "Walhalla" (11/96) for Illusion, and I didn't like it
  that much, but this picture from the foogy morning in the woods is a lot
  better. Not bad! I have split feelings about the music...one of the leads
  reminds me strongly of 1988, and I can't seem to make up my mind if this
  is a good or a bad thing... :0 Editorially, this issue is pretty much
  like all the others. It's november and the scene is gearing up for The

  review: Nothing exceptional about this release either, it's basically the

  picture by Acryl, as well as a pretty good tune by Meta. I have nothing

  review: From this issue on, X-F is a cooperation between Ethic and Abyss,
  since coder Madstop and editor Big-Rat joined Abyss as doublemembers.
  I started reading the mag, taking notes, but suddenly discovered - by
  accident! - that it multitasks quite happily! That's great Ethic, but I'd
  like to have been told before I filled half a page with notes ;) There's
  nothing wrong with X-F presentationwise this time either. The only thing
  you'll need to grow accustomed to is the way you read articles here.
  Rather than flip right for the next page and down for the next article,
  you flip right for the next article! I was a little confused by this at
  first, but soon understood how it worked and after that there were no
  problems.
    The tune is quite comfortable reading music, in that it does not
  irritate and it's not dominating enough to draw attention away from what
  you're reading. And the title picture by Raven/Nuance is a treat for the
  eyes. Overall, this is a good, polished issue.

  review: This intro is clearly a case of 'too much', with lots of effects
  thrown onto the screen. It was this group's first ever release, and
  unfortunately, it shows. If they can learn the noble art of limiting
  themselves, then perhaps they can produce something worthwile, but this
  intro is just another 'let's release something' prod. These words are the
  ones that are accepted: FUCK, HELP, SWITCH, CODERCHAT, QUIT, CREDITS,

  review: OSF opens with some good graphics in the introduction, then
  shows a fast fullscreen zoomrotator. Next is a texturemapped globe, and
  then it's pretty much over. The best thing about it, I guess, is the
  AMOS error message that appears towards the end, which I'm sure was a
  fun joke when it was shown on the big screen. This would have benefited
  greatly from some improved music.

  review: "Kiitos?" is a nice production from Extend, with some goodlooking
  and colorful effects. Unfortunately, the demo doesn't move too fast on my
  machine. The text file mentions an 040/40mhz or better is recommended,
  and I have no trouble believing that. Design is adequate though, and
  neither graphics nor music gets too much on your nerves. There's not a
  lot of actual drawings here, but what there is is mostly functional.
