----------------
DEN> Ace (code, 12/91), Savage, SMB (music, 12/91).

Bacteria was an exclusively danish demoscene group.

Danish graphician and swapper Toastmaster (12/91) joined Rebels, and the
  group died as all the other members also left for various other groups.
Twinz got kicked.
Mr.Thorax joined Dreamscape.

· BacPack Menu (1991, ECS Intro).
  code: Ace, gfx: Toastmaster, music: "funky...but it smb!" by SMB (4ch MOD
  format).
  review: An OK but hardly innovative packkmenu, BacPack has all the
  standard features of its kind. There's a logo on top, a scroller at the
  bottom, and oh yes - a selector in the middle of the screen. However, it
  is passably executed, with some good graphics, making it a bearable
  production. The issue reviewed here is #10. The intro needed KillAGA from
  DOpus, but ran just fine from disk. Release date is uncertain, but it is
  probably late december 91, prior to The Party. The disk was also
  installed with Ace's BacBoot 1.01, and an installer for this toolboot
  was included in the c directory.

Balance was formed in Denmark by Wolfman, TNT, Split, Eddie and Spib in june
of 1991. Some musicpacks were the first releases from the group. The next
members to join were graphicians Connor and Idefix. Eventually yet another
graphician joined, Trade (later handle Motion). The group still lacked a
real coder though, and their search ended after they recruited Wreko from
Divine. Their first real productions were the "Necessary Drugs" packs. Wreko
helped recruit another musician, Mazzachre, and soon after also a second
coder joined, called Scope. Spib then left because of lazyness, and coder
IC3 joined. They got their first board ('SUFFOCATION') when Ramirez joined.
Now it was time for their first trackmo, "Software Failure" [91]. Their next
release was a bbs intro, and then IC3 got kicked again due to lameness.
Their second trackmo, "Deepcore" [07/92], is released.
  The turning point in BLC's career surely came with the release of the
first issue of their diskmag "Magbox" [07/92]. This mag announced both new
musician Chyle as well as Mazzachre's leaving for Focus Design. The group
was still 100% danish.

Balance is a demo group based in Denmark. Originally, Balance released the
diskmag 'MagBox'. However, when the fusion with the Norwegian group Frogs
was decided, they brought with them THEIR diskmag 'Upstream'. Ofcourse
there were some discussion as to what mag to continue publishing, and the
result was a compromise; the mag retained the name Upstream, but used the
old MagBox code and continued the numbering from MagBox. The previous
editors of the two mags, Wolfman (magbox) and Cesium (upstream) were
coeditors of the new mag.
  Coca and Cola formed the ascii-group Lingo while they were still in
Balance, so in effect they were doublemembers. Ranx started working at
Funcom late 1993, but would remain an (inactive) Balancer. Graphician
Chagall also got an offer from Funcom, but decided to go to England to
study art instead, so his further scene career is uncertain. Balance were
also coeditors of the danish chart "Dansktoppen" with Parasite from the
beginning, but the chart was later taken over by Polka Brothers.
  1993 - The Finnish section was formed mid 93 by ex-members of Deadline
(Dionysus, Bad Karma, Nutcase, Xendi) and Alcatraz. Finnish Lohi (ex
Diffusion) left for the PC scene, and coder Xarium joined Parasite mid
93.
  1994 - Norwegian swapper Messiah (Banana Dezign doublemember) joined
Spaceballs late 94.
  1995 - Finnish musucian Nutcase (code gfx music, ex Deadline, new 06/93-
mid95) moved over to the pc section of Balance mid 95. Coder Fizban decided
to leave the scene late 95.

Danish musician Subject (ex Chrome, old handle Chyle, 07/92-01/97) changed
  handle to Prophet and joined Scoopex 01/97. He was a doublemember of
  Passion for a while, from late 94, but later terminated this double
  membership.
Danish graphician and musician Cyboman joined Ambrosia late95.
Finnish sysop Roland left.
Danish coder Scope (07/92-01/95) joined Passion. Scope worked on demos like
  "Deepcore" [07/92], "Lost World" [12/92] and "Syndrome" [12/94] as well as
  the MagBox/Upstream code.
Finnish musician Dr.Fruid (ex Frogs) left the Amiga scene.
German coder Bailey (ex Frogs, 04-10/93) joined Lego. Bailey coded "Newstro"
  [04/93] before leaving.
Norwegian coder Coca (old handle Broth, 10-12/93) joined Cesium's new
  group Session.
Norwegian musician Vegard! (ex-doublemember) left to be a member of Scoopex
  only, but after a while he left them too and joined Melon Dezign.
Nik joined Desire (UPS10).
Danish musician Tricktrax (ex Chrome, 12/92) and hungarian graphician Nexus
  6 (ex Frogs, 10/93) were kicked. Tricktrax is now in Puzzle.
Danish coder Wreko (Jesper, 07/92-12/93) left for the PC scene - more
  specifically Diffusion PC.
Norwegian organizer and previous 'Upstream' editor Cesium (ex Frogs) left
  the scene for a while. As a consequence, his board 'OMAHA THUNDER'
  (opened 03/94) was also closed (12/94). Some time later, he reentered the
  scene with his own group, called Session, and reopened the board there.
Finnish members James (old handle Bad Karma), Dionysus (both ex Deadline,
  new 06-10/93) and Dean left to join Decnite (PRP4).
Danes Eddie (Frederik Esbensen, music swap, 12/91-07/92), Immortal, TNT
  (raytrace, 07/92) and Idefix (gfx, 07/92) all got kicked.
Danish swapper and sysop Ramirez ('SUFFOCATION') joined Majic 12 (RAW4).
Growl (ex Chrome, 12/92) joined Orient.

  review: The very first issue of Magbox is a little thin when it comes to
  the amount of articles, and was meant to be a combination of diskmag and
  messagebox (like Chit-Chat). Graphics are only passable, and the music is
  not particularly revolutionary either. The best and most interesting
  articles this time was Wolfman's history of Balance DK, interview with
  Hannibal/anarchy and a report and interview concerning the controversy
  surrounding the recently held Hurricane party. There is also a lot of
  really unnecessary humour stuff. The news item about Nexus 6/23 Celsius
  Crew (also spelt wrong, btw! =) forming a Hungarian division of Anarchy is
  false. In fact, he joined Frogs and later - when Frogs merged with Balance
  - became a Balance member!
    The mag needs KillAGA to show graphics and play music correctly,
  otherwise it works perfectly.

  review: Much improved graphics is the first thing that you notice, as well
  as some nice music. Much more articles, and the music is better than in
  the first edition too. The mag itself works fine with KillAGA, despite
  some hiccups with the music replay and slight problems with the larger
  proportional fonts. They also correct the incorrect news item about Nexus
  6/23 Celsius Crew from the earlier issue.

  14th in The Party 92 demo competition.
  review: A nice, polished trackmo from the coder of the MagBox, later
  Upstream diskmag. It has the polished feel of Andromeda or even
  Phenomena...I guess it's the graphics that give the impression. Some of
  the logos or fonts could have been taken right out of any demo by those
  two groups! Testament to Connor's talent, I guess. Nothing TRULY out-
  standing here...except perhaps the spacecut routine - that was unusual
  back in 1992. Also, they present a glenz vector with LOTS of faces,
  though the 'this is a new world record' effects failed to impress me a
  long time ago. Who cares if you've got four more faces on your glenz
  than the next guy, when you can't even spot the difference with the
  naked eye? It's the visual part that matters. Excite me!
    Apart from the 'slime vector', which had graphical errors, I had no
  problems running this on my system.

  review: Another good issue of Upstream surfaces. Contentwise, this is
  perhaps not their strongest issue, but I believe that is a mirror of the
  demo situation at that time; before the big AGA demos started appearing.
  The scene was at a crossroads, people were busy experimenting with AGA
  and consequently weren't releasing demos.
    Visually, this issue is OK, if not their best. Subject's music sounds
  like he's trying to do a Lizardking cover...which is a little ironic,
  given that the next issue came with a Lizardking soundtrack :) Not a bad
  issue, but then - Upstream rarely is! The original disk also contained
  the 22k intro "Smalltalk" [10/93].

        Razor 1911, editors: Wolfman, Cesium, Mount/Polka Brothers.
  Released at The Gathering 94.
  review: Upstream delivers quality with this issue, with some very nice
  and interesting articles - like the Chromag interview. There's nothing
  wrong with the audio-visuals in the mag either; the backgrounds and the
  panel both have nice layouts. This was the first issue with a third
  'main' editor, Mount. You won't notice much of a difference, though.
  The option to save an article to disk is nice. The only reason this
  qualifies as a multifile mag is the fact that the module is a separate
  file. Not much more to say about this, except it's one of the best ever
  mags. One slight sniggle, though - a BIG BUG! When attempting to load a
  new module, the mag crashes the moment I press the mouse button!
    The intro is a rather bland affair, to be honest. It resembles those
  old trailer intros Brainstorm used to release for Zine, without any of
  the excellence of those. On the A500, the intro seemed somewhat unstable
  when setpatch wasn't run first. The tune 'Water Below' by Lizardking was
  later used in the Razor 1911 musicdisk "Memorial Songs II" (1995).

  code: Scope, Kata (additional), gfx: R.W.O, Unique, music: "Culture

  review: I'm actually a little surprised that this didn't do better than
  14th at The Party, though ofcourse there were a lot of good releases
  that year. This one has very fast, mostly vector, routines timed to the
  usual techno music. Some interesting stuff here, a.o. what was probably
  the first HAM8 plasma. Did anyone do that earlier? The fire effect is
  ugly and blocky, though. THAT effect has been substantially improved with
  time! R.W.O's picture "Zailorpower" also participated in the graphics
  competition at The Party, and finished on a split 39th place.
    On my 030 machine, the road part fucks up graphically. I do not know
  what causes this, really... Perhaps the routine is timed for a standard
  14mhz 020 in some way...who knows? The demo works fine on a standard
  A1200, no fast needed.

  review: One of the greatest diskmags of the time, Upstream has both
  interesting articles and top presentation. You can't go wrong with this.
  The reason for the ECS/AGA at the top needs a little explanation; the
  intropicture by R.W.O is in 256 colors, and if you're running on an ECS
  machine, you'll just get an explanatory text, like: "No aga - no pic!".
  The mag itself runs fine on most configurations. Needs req.library to

· Embryo (1995, 12.08, AGA HD Multifile).
  code: Confidence, Gfx: Grid, Music: Atheist & Deelite.
  8th in the Assembly 95 demo competition.
  review: An acceptable production from the Swedish division of Balance.
  Nothing outstanding, just nice. The music is frantic demo-techno, and not
  the worst of its kind. The demo includes two fullscreen pictures by Grid,
  one of a screaming man's face with a twirl effect around it, and one
  that's reminiscent of Hajime's metal people art, though of a kitten.
  I did a search, and as far as I can see Grid did not enter any graphics
  competitions during 1995. This probably means this is the only place
  you'll ever see these :) One thing I noticed about the effects is that
  Confidence seems to use a rather unique method of 'smoothing' his
  effects, almost reminiscent of the raster effects used in comic books.
  Interesting... To conclude: Acceptable.
    Does not require fastmem, but takes advantage of it.

· Freak (1996, 26.05, AGA 4MB File).
  code: Confidence, gfx: Grid, Gorg, music: Smartass.
  3rd in the Icing 96 demo competition.
  review: To the sound of a heavy, boombastic tune by Smartass we're given
  a demo without much soul. The effects are of highly variable quality,
  some are very impressive and others are not so hot. The big tunnel
  routine is nice, and sort of reminds me of the tunnel in TBL's "Captured
  Dreams" [03/97]. The morphing (env?) object is too blocky though, I think
  Confidence should have spent some more time on that. There's only one
  real piece of graphics here, a fullscreen picture of a woman's face -
  not signed but presumably by Grid, since it resembles his style. The best
  effect here is a truly great one, though - an amazing light routine,
  where we're sort of looking into the light, and it changes a little. It's
  awfully smooth and nice, and lifts the demo as a whole a lot. I guess
  this is worth getting for that effect alone ;)
    I tried to run this with only 4MB fast and my Kickstart mapped to RAM
  (eating 512k in the process), and found I didn't have enough memory.
  So if you're gonna run this on a 4MB machine, be sure you're not
  remapping your kickstart, oki?

· Endolymfa (1996, 28.12, AGA File).
  code: Confidence, gfx: Gorg, music: Smartass.
  3rd in The Party 6 demo competition.
  review: The best part of ENDOLYMFA is the opening, which with it's fast
  texture mapped and animated surfaces create a nice mood...which
  unfortunately it fails to sustain through the rest of the demo. It's a
  rather short demo too, which doesn't help matters that much. The effects
  consists mainly of the usual env and phong objects, with an overweight on
  toruses. The music's nothing special. A little disappointing.
    In my eyes, Syndrome's "Subzero" (6th) is a much better demo than this.
  Ofcourse, results are not up to me, but to the voters at The Party :)
  Seeing as the (unpacked) file is over 2MB in size, this will obviously
  need a little more memory than the 2MBs of chipmem in AGA Amigas. I do
  not know exactly how much, though, since the distribution doesn't have
  any text describing requirements.

Bamiga Sector One was formed in Belgium in june of 1986 by Ermida and two
others. Their members later found their way into such groups as Kefrens
(S.L.L). They were also in several cooperations, with a.o. Cybertech.
Necromancer and The Visitor are father and son.
  1988 - An interview with Ermida in Crack Journal #10 [11/88] revealed how
they were having problems getting crackers, seeing as Lord Blitter was
working for a large software company, Chatterbox went to the university,
Skylight is very busy at the moment with other things, The Big Fat Lamer is
abroad and won't be back until next year, and finally Viral Empath is now
busy writing protections (!) for a large software firm ;) Outbound joined in
december.
  1990 - Danish musician S.L.L (ex Red Sector) left for Kefrens early
february. The group was declared dead early 1990.

· NIVEL.exe (1993, late?, ECS Intro).
  code: Epidemic, gfx: Prayer, music: Ukulele (2x The Player 5.0A format).
  review: This cool little intro opens with a good picture by Prayer, set
  to the opening bars of Ukulele's frantic and weird tune - VERY hard to
  classify! Then we're shown an amiga rules-like effect, only divided...
  hard to explain really! At the top of the screen there's a B.P. logo.
  Then there's the endpart, with a small mummi-troll (Norwegians and Swedes
  will know these) in the left corner, and a fractal-triangle-zoomer.
  Pressing and holding the right mouse button makes it turn the other way,
  by the way :) In addition, there's a good an unusual text writer. Not bad
  at all, this! When you exit, you get a few bars of another module, which
  is kind of...nice.

  review: Yeah! This is more like it! Short, but good. I can't really find
  anything to put my finger on here, except perhaps the weird tune...but
  it's by Ukulele, so what can you expect? The main effect consists of
  bitmap manipulations done to a picture of Mickey Mouse seen from behind,

Croatians Alpha (music, ex Polaris, new 02/94) and Blue Deville (gfx, ex
  Polaris, new 02/94) left with Finnish musician Kristian (old handle
  Saracen, ex Destiny) to join Talent late 95. Curiously enough, the news
  where I found this used his old handle 'Saracen'...did he change back?
  Anyway, the Talent memberlist reflects the Saracen handle.
Norwegian sysop Hellfreak ('WARZONE', 93) got kicked.
Norwegian coder and sysop Mr.Z (ex Talent) joined Scoopex.
Norwegian sysop Micro-Pal ('THE WHITE HOUSE', ex Alcatraz, 93) left.
Norwegian swapper Messiah (ex Equinox, Balance doublememb, 02/94) joined
  Spaceballs.
Graphician Marlboro got kicked.
Croatian swapper Rod (Svitlica Stanjoe, ex Polaris, new 02/94) left the
  scene.

Banana Dezign was formed by It/ex Cryptoburners and Micro-Pal/ex Alcatraz.
There is some mysticism connected with Brainbug's membership. He was in
Alcatraz back in 1992, and contributed a tune to the music competition at
TG'94 under the handle Brainbug/ALCATRAZ. However, he contributed music,
seemingly as a full member, to two BDZ productions between 11/93 and 03/94.
Was he a doublemember, perhaps?

· Melbu (1993, 31.11, AGA Intro).
  code: Necro, Bob (debug), gfx: Marlboro (logo), Necro (fonts), music:
  Brainbug (The Player 5.0A format).
  Made at the Combase'93 party, but released later.
  review: Not the most serious of people, these guys, are they? Another
  minimal production this, with some very yellow scanned pictures of the
  participants and filled vector bananas. The best thing about this small
  prod, tho', is Marlboro's logo. Very cool! The music is a heavy metal
  riff thing, not Brainbug's best by far. This was probably a lot more fun
  to make than it is to watch.

  review: Not much to see here, just a text writer over some red/orange
  graphics mapped on a sphere, flying around. The humourous text is rather
  fun though. 'Because we care.' You can run the intro without AGA
  installed, in which case you'll get a requester saying that the demo
  requires AGA to run and you get to hear the soundtrack.

BB was a group that came to the amiga from the c64 scene, and was pretty big
in the German scene for a while in the late 80's. Their most active members
were all in the subgroup The Syndicate of the Beastie Boys.
  1988 - December saw the release of their classic "Megademo" [12/88].
  1989 - The Syndicate/BB released a packdisk from the Bamiga Sector 1 and
Warfalcons party [02/89]. At this party the group also released a new intro
which announced Dingo, No.1 and Art Force as new members, and said bye bye
to Alex and Rush. Mel had also planned a demo for this competition, but
could not complete it in time.

Norwegian graphician Fairfax joined Pure Metal Coders.

  code: Dingo, gfx: The Dark Lord (logo), n/a (picture), music: "Android" by
  Skydancer. Released at the Bamiga Sector 1 and Warfalcons copy party.
  review: Another oldskool onescreen intro, this one is at least a LITTLE
  original. The top of the screen feature a Beastie Boys logo moving from
  side to side... This is done in classic demologo style, but is still not
  the worst example of its kind... in shades of grey and gold. The bottom of
  the screen is occupied by a bouncing scroller (like a DYCP on the c64!).
  The middle of the screen is the most interesting part, though - it
  features a very nicely drawn picture of a pair of earphones, over which a
  circle is laid. This circle has equalizers spinning around it... it's kind
  of hard to describe, but looks real cool! For an example of an oldskool
  intro, you could go far worse than this. The name of the intro does not
  appear anywhere inside, but was taken from the results.

  review: Now, this is what makes wading through endless amounts of old
  demos and intros seem halfway worth my time. Every now and then you come
  across a small jewel, and this is just such an instant. Much thanks to two
  elements - the music and the plasma-like effect that I really don't know
  what to call :) - a little magic is created here. It's one of those rare
  little productions that create a little atmosphere... But stop reading
  what I'm wabbling on about, and GO GET THIS - hmm, that music is just an
  amazingly wondrous piece...
    After pressing left mousebutton to exit, you are shown a picture with

  1995 - Late in the year, Dreamkiller (music swap) and Suicide (code) both
decided to leave the scene. Sid and Dano, and the board 'DISABLE' were
kicked, and finally german swapper and ascii artist Rave left the scene.
  1997 - Azure, Antibrain and Fiver had a sequel to "Television" [02/96]
planned for The Party 97, but ultimately they did not release it.

· Pyrox (1994, 28.12, 40k AGA Intro).
  code: Azure, gfx: JMS, music: Antibrain (ProMizer 2.0 format).
  9th in The Party 4 40k intro competition.
  review: Who would have known Azure would rise to such heights? After
  viewing this effort, you could easily have been forgiven for thinking
  he'd end up like all the other uninspired coders. What you get here is
  ONE routine, 'the world's first' Ham8-plasma, as they claim. I have no
  idea whether that holds true or not, but I do know that even back in 1994
  full-screen plasma routines were hopelessly old. I find nothing here to
  recommend this, other than the later fame of some of its creators.

  review: Dice is a very, very cool little 40k'er! It opens with some cool
  fullscreen plasma, then goes on to show us a few objects of what can best
  be described as 'plasmamapped vectors'. It looks a little like very
  colorful gouraud, if that helps any... Then it moves on to texturemapping
  a cool picture by Fiver onto a cube (and later a torus). The cube starts
  spinning around, and so does the graphics on the cube! What can I say?

· Zimbabwe (1995, .11, AGA File).
  code: Azure, gfx: Fiver/Artwork, Antibrain, Coming Art, music: Antibrain.
  Released at the Voyage 95 party.
  review: Oh, this was fun! Of course, the tune is what MAKES this demo.
  It's a groovy techno thing, with some melodies that just kind of eats
  themselves into your head and refuses to go away... The effects here are
  timed to the music IN EXTREMIS, the effects sometimes changing to every
  single beat of the music... The drawback here is that the effects are
  repeated a little too often. Had it not been for that, this would have
  been very close to a perfect production! The effects on display are not
  too numerous, but a full-screen rotzoomer and a gouraud-donut are perhaps
  the best ones. "I *PARTICULARLY* enjoyed that...Let's see what's next."
    In june 1997, Azure released version 1.4, which fixes some problems
  on 040/060 machines, and fixes the classic The Player 6.1A bugs.

  2nd at Convention 96 demo competition.
  review: Not nearly as good as "Zimbabwe", this production is still very
  much Bizarre. It's - as they say - an experimental attempt to combine
  videoanimations with demo effects. In my eyes, they do not entirely
  succeed on their experiment, mainly due to two reasons: 1) It's too long.
  Halving the size, using some of the better video (like the cornflakes),
  and throwing out some of the less interesting stuff would make this a lot
  more desireable. And 2), the effects do not blend together in the way
  that I suppose Bizarre wanted. It's two very different aspects, and there
  is no actual successful merging. Requires an accelerator.

  review: Now, here's a very good intro! Lots of bump mapping here, and
  some seriously FAAAAAAASt env and phong objects make this a very
  enjoyable ride indeed! No wonder really, this is actually just the code to
  Azure's "Phi" [07/96] (released for Artwork one week earlier) with the
  added value of Axis' cool water ripple routine (later used in his
  "SILIConvention 97 Invitation" for Arsenic). But hey, that doesn't matter,
  since this is STILL a very cool intro ;)
    Azure released a fixed version 1.1 in february 1998, which should work
  fine with 040/060 machines, and had that good old The Player 6.1A bug
  fixed.

The Black Lotus was formed in 1989, when Atari coder Dickhead and his
companion Rubberduck decided to build their own group on the Amiga.
Who could have known, back then, that TBL would once rule the Amiga demo
scene? From their very humble beginnings they've managed to build a group
of truly epic proportions. They've recruited some of the best artists in
the scene, and without the shadow of a doubt have the best graphics artists
(Danny, Louie, Facet)! Their winning streak officially started at The
Gathering 96, when their landmark demo "Tint" won the demo competition, and
came full circle when they returned a year later to finish off the
competition with "Captured Dreams". They were the first group to win at
The Gathering two years in a row; Artwork have now won 3 years in a row at
the Symposium party in Germany. It'll be interesting to see if TBL can tie
the record at TG98 ;)
  A pc section of the group was born in 1997.
  Equalizer, Louie and Rodney are now working in the UK on games. Danny,
Tim and Lowlife works on games at Eidos Interactive in the UK.

Swedish coder Noy (02-06/96) left to help form the new group Dole.
Swedish coders Offa (Mattias Gruvman, 08/94-03/97) and  Equalizer (Daniel
  Hansen, 08/94-03/97) both left the Amiga scene for professional game
  programming careers. They now live in an apartment in Sweden together
  with Scout, all working for Digital Illusions. For the sake of order,
  Offa and Eq have been removed from the memberlist.
The Atari Falcon section was totally disbanded; they're now back to only
  being active on the PC and Amiga.
Jeek Elemental (nor code), Vfcon, Axm (swe gfx, 95), Cypher (swe gfx,
  02/96), Fishbone (swe gfx), Igloo (swe gfx, 02/96), Sag (code music) and
  Shark (sysop) were all dismissed due to lack of proper scene activity.

  15th in The Party 5 demo competition.
  review: Another not-too-cool older TBL release. This one hints at what
  "Tint" will be, but does not quite make it. The whole demo is presented
  in that annoying 'every-other-pixel-is-black' mode, and if you ask me,
  that is a major drawback. It just doesn't look as good as solid effects!
  The most innovative effect here is a little hard to describe, but I'll
  try. It's a magnified picture by Rodney in the background, and on top of
  that there's two vectorcubes, spinning and space-cutting each other.
  One is an RGB-vector, and the other is texturemapped with a small portion
  of the mentioned picture. As the picture is magnified, it's larger than
  the screen, and the whole thing moves as the vectorcubes travel around on
  it. Very very nice. The picture is "Climber" by Rodney, which came 2nd in
  the graphics competition at The Party. Too bad the rest of the demo is
  not equally exciting.
    Azazel's module was made in two hours, during The Party! This is also
  very likely his first released module for TBL; he was in DCS two months
  earlier. Though it'll work fine on an 020-14, at least an 030-28 with 2mb
  fast is recommended.

  review: This is not half bad! Though it has some mysterious palette
  choices, and the design is sometimes...well, enough about that...this
  is one of TBL's better productions. There's the usual shading and stuff -
  and the usual Azazel music :( Not much to say, really - an above-average

  review: This nice 4k'er opens with some red-on-black quasi-plasma stuff,
  which then turns into a tunnel of sorts. We travel into the tunnel, which
  has The Black Lotus written on the walls, before coming to the coolest
  effect in the intro, a 'sea' of sorts of gradient blue-on-black. Then the
  tunnel routine is repeated with the same blue-on-black palette and it's
  over. Be advised that the version I have is 1.1, and the file-id.diz file
  claims it's 'fixed'.

  Winner of The Gathering 96 demo competition!
  review: A little slow to get started this, but when the second piece of
  music kicks in, it takes off in a big way. Ah yes, the music. I can't
  help thinking that with some other musician, this could have been a well
  and truly GREAT production. As it stands, the first tune stinks big-time,
  and the second ranges from lousy to great in what is a truly bizarre
  mixture. It seems Azazel can't decide between techno and more traditional
  demo music, and as a result he tries to mix the two with varied results.
  The code here smells more of good ideas than truly advanced routines, but
  is overall quite acceptable. So to sum up: The first part sucks, the rest
  is quite good. Worth noting is that the compopictures from the artists
  above are all included. Danny's '18bit truecolor' picture seems to be an
  elaboration on Lemon.thoughts, which won a clipart competition in
  EuroChart (I think) some time ago. An OK production with GREAT graphics.
  Recommended 030-28 or above.

  review: Oh yes. This is the first truly outstanding TBL production I
  have witnessed, and what a demo it is! Since last time they've obviously
  gotten some design help from their newest members. While some of their
  earlier productions have looked a little weird, this one looks just
  smashing! The demo opens with an animation of a spaceship leaving a space
  station, to great accompanying strings music. After that, we're treated
  to the usual rendered objects and stuff, with one very important
  difference: These are cool, advanced routines that look GOOD. Even their
  rather untraditional palette choices now look smashing! What can I say?
  TINT only HINTed at things to come! Recommended!
  Runs on standard A1200's with enough mem, but recommends 030-28 or above.

· Darkside (1996, 16.06, AGA ?MB File).
  code: Rubberduck, Noy, Offa, gfx: Facet, Danny, Tudor, music: Lizard.
  Winner of the Remedy 96 demo competition!
  review: Darkside signalled a drastic departure for TBL. Gone was the
  flashy techno, to be replaced with a tune by Lizard that's closer to a
  film soundtrack than anything else. A lot of people were skeptical when
  Darkside was released, but in my eyes this is one of their better demos.
  It opens with some dots morphing to form the names of the producers. This
  could have been done a lot better, the routine now looks downright ugly!
  The titlepicture by Facet is one of his most surrealistic pictures ever!
  The next picture is a raytraced one by Tudor, of a hand stretching out of
  a monitor to touch the A1200 beyond...very good! Another good routine
  here is the travel down spinning tunnel with the white light in the
  centre... This looks like a precursor to the tunnel at the end of the
  zoomer in the later TBL demo "Captured Dreams" (03/97)!
    I like "Darkside". It's an unusual demo, in that it manages to create a
  good, gothic atmosphere and still throw in a few good effects. The music
  deserves a special mention; it's a highly original tune. The release
  version apparently had some bugs, but a fixed version was later to be
  put up on the TBL website. On my 4mb fast system, I couldn't run this
  demo because I didn't have enough memory. This may have been due to
  the fact that I map my Kickstart to fast ram, but I can't be sure...
  It DOES require some fast, I'm just not sure how much :)

  review: WOW! I've just been blown away by an amazing piece of 40k intro.
  This small file oozes professionalism from every pore. The effects are
  good and plentiful, much more than I'd expect to see in a 40k intro these
  days. There are so many '1-effect-intros' out there. This one opens with
  some envmapped objects, which isn't all that unusual these days :)
  Next we travel down a rather cool yellow/green tunnel...which suddenly
  has the objects from before in the middle! It's like Offa's saying
  'maybe you can do that too...and this...but can you do them TOGETHER!?'.
  Next there's a tecturemapped sube spaceut with some envampped objects,
  before it ends with what can only be described as motionblurred
  fireflies. Not bad at all, TBL...

  review: The show opens with a texturemapped tunnel, with credits texture-
  mapped onto squares flying around. A 'CD' logo is next, then we zoom into
  the middle of the picture. At first it looks like a normal zoomer, but it
  quickly becomes evident that there's layers and layers of fantastic gfx
  before we hit the bottom! There, it smoothly integrates into some lights
  flashing out at us in time with the music before the entire zoom process
  is reversed. Only this time, we zoom back a little more than where we
  started, and it becomes evident that we're in a room with several
  different 'tv-boxes' hovering in the air. They all have changing pictures
  on them, and we travel around until we settle on a picture of the side of
  a skyscraper. This is now the main focal point, and soon a beautiful
  dolphin comes swimming/flying by, reflected onto the windows of the
  skyscraper. It's all very 'Beyond the Mind's Eye'. We see the dolphin
  from three different angles before we move on. Next is an amazing, big
  dinosaur object (T-Rex?), sneering at us. This object is made up of MANY
  polygons! Next we're treated to Danny and Louie's coop picture "Angelic
  Particles" (also winner of the TG97 graphics competition) before we move
  on to another showstopping effect... We're suddenly underwater, with calm
  music and a soothing atmosphere. Next is another texturemapped tunnel,
  this time with a moving lighstource. It goes on with some butterflies
  flying around ancient architecture, before the show is rounded off with
  not-too-good picture by Rodney.
    CD has to be one of the best demos ever released, period. It seems TBL
  has got most of their design problems out of the way, and this demo sure
  kicks ass! One thing I especially noticed and liked, was the way the music
  changed to the MOOD of the demo. For the faster, frantic parts there was
  techno-style stuff, while underwater we were treated to a beautiful pan-
  pipe mood tune. Great!
    Requires at least 4mb fast, and a 030-50 processor. However, the system
  checker searches for 020+, so in theory it is possible to run on inferior

Bomb Software (1994-)
---------------------
FRA> Ben (code, 12/96), Clawz (Mathieu Berthaud, founder music, ex Complex,
     doublememb Impact Studios [pc], 09/94-12/95), Gengis (Frederic Heintz,
     founder code, ex Complex, 09/94-07/95), Hof (gfx, 12/94), Made (Carlos
     Pardo, gfx, ex Scoopex, new late95-04/98), Suny (gfx, ex Movement, new

     Dreamdealers, new late94-12/94), Zebig (gfx, 12/94).
DEN> Roscoe (Steen Hillestroem, swap, ex Razor 1911, new late94).
GER> Trasher (Oliver Plink, swap, triplememb Sanity and Artwork, new
     late95).

After releasing their last demo for Complex, "Real" [04/94], Bomb! was
formed by Clawz and Gengis in August 1994. Soon after, they recruited the
French graphicians Trajan and Suny, and the Danish swapper Roscoe. In
september, they then won the intro competition at the 3S Party with their
first release, the 64k intro "Casual" [09/94]. They then worked hard for a
few months, and could present to the public at The Party 4 the demo "Motion:
Origin 2" [12/94]. The original "Origin" [12/93] (made for Complex) had
secured Gengis the winner at last year's party, but "Motion" didn't come in
better than 3rd.
  1995 - Next they recruited top french graphician Made and spent most of
1995 working on their commercial game Fears, which was previewed at the end
of "Motion" and released in September. The game was done by Gengis (code),
Hof (gfx), Titan (gfx), Suny (gfx) and Clawz (music).
  1996 - Following the completion of the game, Gengis and Clawz released
their last Amiga production in the "Saturne 3 Invitation" [07/96], and left
for the PC scene - where in addition to scene activities they are currently
working on an adventure game. Made now seems to be the only remaining active
Amiga member, contributing graphics to productions left, right and center -
though mostly for his old group Scoopex. However, he has lately begun doing
more and more 24bit pictures in high resolution, and now he also works
almost exclusively for the PC scene. Gengis and Clawz first joined Impact
Studios on the pc, before moving on to Oxygene. They are now back in their
own group Bomb!, though - and the pc section seems to become as powerful as
the Amiga one was in its time...

  code: Gengis, gfx: Hof/?, Walt/? (car person), music: "Blache Bleuche" by

  review: A cute and nice first production from Bomb. Nice font!

  code: Gengis, gfx: Suny, Trajan, Zebig, Hof, music: "Overtaking" (main)
  and "Intermediate" (end) by Clawz (The Player 6.0A format).
  3rd in The Party 4 demo competition.
  review: Gengis and Clawz followed up the original "Origin" (released for
  Complex), who won at The Party the previous year, with this great demo.
  The strongest point of Motion has certainly got to be its design.
  It opens with a great loading picture by Suny (I believe it also competed
  in the gfx competition), which looks like it was inspired from the scene
  in the introduction to the movie 'Cliffhanger'. Then, an eye suddenly
  looks at us. We zoom into the eye, and the demo begins. We're treated to
  a variety of good effects, including fast voxel landscapes and various
  vector environments. The real showstopper however, appears at the end of
  the demo, when Gengis revealed the first real Doom routine - with walls,
  floor and ceiling. For more of that routine, buy the game 'Fears', which
  was developed by much the same team as this demo. The demo is timed to
  one of Clawz' techno tunes, which sounds great. Then again, few people on
  the Amiga do techno as well as Clawz... The endpart requires some fast
  mem, a fact that made it guru when it was originally shown at The Party.
  However, the whole demo runs perfectly on unexpanded A1200's except the
  endpart. It supports external drives. Whole-heartedly recommended.

· Saturne Party 3 (1995, .07, AGA File).
  code: Gengis, gfx: Made, music: "Kuulitte Oikein" by Clawz (4ch MOD
  format).
  review: This is certainly one of the smoothest invitation intros I've
  ever seen, and certainly the one with the best graphics! It opens with a
  fullscreen picture by Made, of a small green gnome, before showing a
  Saturne Party logo with a vectorbased '3' zooming back in place. Then
  we're taken to the text selector, which is a set of tecturemapped cubes.
  The great thing is that the cubes have two sides, one French and one
  English, so you can actually select the language you wish to read the
  text in! The music is also great, so what more can I say? This is one of
  the best invitations ever - never mind that the party was cancelled at
  the date mentioned in the intro, and wasn't held until april of 1996!
  For further irony, it was at that very party that Gengis released his
  first production for the pc, Impact Studios' "Bomb", cooperating with -
  yes, you've guessed it - among others Made and Clawz :-) This was almost
  certainly Gengis' last Amiga production. He was next in Impact Studios (as
  mentioned) on the pc, before moving on to Oxygene and finally back to
  Bomb.
    As for the release date, I found it on a pack where all the other
  productions were from early .07, so it's a pretty probable date.

  "Temple of Sun Remix" by Legend and Yolk (8ch XM format).
  Winner of The Party 96 demo competition!
  review: Bomb!'s amiga swansong containted what was perhaps the (upto then)
  most advanced 3d scenes ever realised on the machine... Beautiful design
  coupled with fast, great-looking env and bumpmapped objetcs and 3d scenes
  made this one of the VERY best demos of 1996. Mercifully short, but
  nevertheless a real powerdemonstration, "S7" is - in my book - the second
  best demo of 96. What was so special about the demo was perhaps that coder
  Ben was a total unknown, and to our knowledge never released anything ever
  again... Made's title picture is a special version of his "Eden 377"
  (which he came 2nd with in the graphics competition at the same party)
  with the title of the demo overlaid.
    Please note that the version reviewed is tagged Revision 2.0, with a few
  bugs fixed from the competition version.

GER> Cocoon (Stefan Hardt, code swap, ex Savage, old handle Mayday, 03/94),

     (Christian Meyer, swap music, ex Savage, 03/94), Sting (Dirk Dallmann,
     ascii swap).
???> Mirage (gfx, 12/94).

Bonzai was formed by Sting/ex Proline. However, shortly after they were
formed Sting left to joined Alcatraz instead. The news of BOTH the birth and
death of Bonzai were in Propaganda #4 :). In addition to the 'Gimme Alcohol'
demo, they also contributed the only game in the game competition at the
Dooms Day 94 party.

Fox joined Dominators.
German swapper X-Poole got an offer to join Platin, but instead went to
  Nuance.

  Love Like Blood (File).

  review: I'm sorry Bonzai, but this intro just bores me. No redeeming
  qualities, design flaws, and...well, that tune is just annoying.

  Gimme Alcohol (1994, 09.10, Demo).
  Contribution for the Doom's Day 94 demo competition.


Bonzai Brothers (1995-)
-----------------------
GER> Cocoon (ex Vodka), Dr.Avalanche (Rene Kueppers, swap, ex Vodka), Risc
     (mainorg swap, ex Vodka).

After Sting lost control over Alcatraz, he formed BB with most ex members
of Alcatraz Germany (ROM #4). Apparently, the Brothers in BB was
intentional, to avoid confusion with the PC demo group Bonzai. It didn't
help much, though, since in Propaganda #4's news section they're
consistently referred to as just Bonzai :) ...Still not sure if this group's
the same as the one above, due to some conflicting information. When
original organizer Sting left, swapper Risc took over as the new WHQ.

Hardy (code) and MBD left the scene late 95.
Finnish musician The Hooligan left to be in Fanatic only, late 95.
Maxx, Powl (both ex Vodka) and Gonzo all joined Illusion late 95.
German swapper Ghandy (ex Rebels, new ROM4) and coder Toaster (ex Vodka)
  left to join Gods.
German swapper and founder Sting (ex Alcatraz) joined Abyss late 95.

Sting back again!


Boom Design (-1994)

???> Barrax (ex Extreme), Cobold (swi? 10/89), Extabulator, Mac, Mad
     Freak (ex Deadlock), Phazer, Scott (swi? music, 90), Top Azz, Voyager.

Brainstorm was formed a short while before may 1989 by Chester (gfx) and
Majestic (code), and their first release was "Lazer Roll" (05/89). During
the summer they recruited more members (like Orlando), and at the end of the
summer vacation they were joined by the entire group Axxis. This group had
both a Swiss and German section, but the German section was found to be
substandard and was forced to leave after a while. Another member, swapper
Joker, left the scene soon after.
  They had by now started planning what would become a legendary diskmag,
"Zine". It was originally conceptuated as a cooperation between Brainstorm
and another big Swiss group at the time, Setrox, but the latter eventually
decided against being part of the project. Due to this, their coder The
Accused, who DID believe in the project, left them to join Brainstorm. The
first issue was released in october. They were now a totally Swiss group
again, except from two members (Shadow, Yankee) in Germany.
  Sometime between issue 3 [02/90] and 4 [04/90] they decided to kick their
German writer Yankee (10/89-02/90) because he wasn't productive enough. He
was a freelance writer for D.I.S.C. for a while before finally joining
Addonic around 07/90. Also two new members joined, SixPack (old handle
Angledust) and Taskmaster, which left them with only one non-Swiss member,
Shadow. Swiss members Sixpack (old handle Angeldust, new 03-06/90) and
Mr.Frost then left late 90.
  1993 - Brainstorm died in the end of 1993, after some key members - Axel
(music, ex The Perfects, new late90), Tin (gfx, new 03/92) and Rob Rose
(code, 91) - found some things said in diskmags by Orlando, Chester and Oli
stupid. They felt that the name of Brainstorm had been tainted by these
interviews, and decided to declare the group dead. So the three members
instead started a new group called Brainstorm Productions, with the
intention to make a better, more demo-oriented group. Ofcourse, their plans
never became what they had imagined, and Brainstorm Productions never
released a single thing.

Swiss graphician Peace (ex The Perfects, new late90) joined Scoopex late
  92/early 93.
Hoover joined Rebels, which means that the newly started Finnish branch is
  once again dead. There are no more foreign sections anymore, BRS is now
  100% Swiss again!
Danish swapper The Pride (ex Flash Productions) joined Sanity.

  format), editor: The Accused, Majestic.
  review: Another small piece of history... The very first issue of Zine!
  The first thing that strikes me (having read a couple of the later issues)
  is how little the layout has changed since that first issue. It's already
  a nice mag, and probably the very first one on the amiga that scrolled the
  pages, and not just faded in the next one. There's no extraordinary
  visuals or anything here, you just enter slap bang right in the middle of
  the magazine. Editorially there's not much to shout about though, just 48
  articles all included, and that includes a ridiculous amount of
  'interviews' with more or less interesting scene people. This mag would
  improve over time, though.

  review: First thing that strikes you is that there's now an "intro"
  picture of sorts as you load the mag...at least that's what I presume it's
  supposed to be... I can't see it unscrambled on my machine you see, and
  caches off and original chipset doesn't help either :( But it doesn't
  crash and soon the second issue of Zine is staring you in the face.
  Nothing has changed graphically, the mag looks the same, and almost reads
  the same. There's still endless "interviews" with standardized questions
  for unknown groups, but just as in the first issue there's also a few
  interesting articles.

  review: I still can't see the loader picture, so that is pretty much lost
  on me, but the mag loads and you can immediately see that graphically it
  is still the same. It contains about the standard amount of information by
  now, some 60 articles - and still too many 'interviews'. This issue
  announced The Accused wasn't going to be working on the next issue since
  he has to go to the army. New editor from issue #4 would be Orlando.

  Released at the Red Sector Inc, Alpha FLight and Spectral party 90.
  review: Some new blood in the editor chair for this issue, since previous
  editor The Accused had left for the army, was Orlando. And it seems the
  change was for the better: They present a mag with more to read than ever,
  99 articles this time! Some changes since last time, writer Yankee was
  kicked, and their proposed party with Alcatraz was cancelled (hence this
  was not released there, as promised in the last issue). This was also the
  first issue with a real news section (though news that Shining 8 are dead
  were WRONG :). This is perhaps the first GOOD issue, as far as the reading
  goes, and it now comes across as a much more focused effort than the first
  three issues. The music is NOT good... :)

  review: Again, nothing has changed on the graphical front (perhaps time
  for a new logo?). But the improved editorial content is carried on, and
  the news corner is much more extensive than last time. Also the interviews
  that swamped the first issues of the mag are now more restrained, and with
  people that are actually halfway interesting to read about! There's a few
  less articles than last time (72). This was to be Orlando's last issue as
  editor, as The Accused had returned from his army service.
    Just one almost priceless anecdote: After announcing rumours that IBM
  are planning the release of a new home computer with an 80286 processor
  (possibly even 386! they claim), they deliver this little comment: "That
  sounds funny, a scene on a IBM-computer!". Oh, and this little newsitem:

  articles. Some changes and improvements to the coding and the graphics had
  also been performed, all changes to the better. This was the first time
  (actually, the first time EVER) we saw the bar under the articles that
  allows us to see how much is left of a given article - now a standard
  feature in any diskmag. This issue also celebrated the first birthday for
  the magazine, it was now one year old. Comparing this issue to the first
  ones, you can certainly say that the mag had matured! This was also
  another kind of celebratory issue, since last month the mag had finally
  overtaken Alpha Flight's "Cracker Journal" as the no.1 mag on the scene in
  the Official Eurocharts!

  review: Impressive for a 1991 demo, innovative coder Rob Rose here shows
  us routines that shouldn't really be possible on the Amigas at the time
  :) - like texturemapping and an incredibly fast mandelbrot fractal
  generator. The overall impression is good, and the fact that the texture-
  mapped cubes don't always look as good as they could, is quite
  forgiveable when you consider the achievement. The demo runs perhaps a
  little too fast on my machine, and cuts to the next part at exactly the
  moment when the credits are about to appear in the scrolltext. Peeking in
  the executable doesn't help either, since Rob Rose is probably using his
  own decruncher or something...I certainly couldn't rip it, at least :(

Boards; THE BEER BAR (aut).

Bronx was born in Turkiye, of all places, after the Zombie Boys changed
their name to Bronx in january of 1991. They are probably best known for
their oddly named diskmag "Cemetery News" and their controversial packmag
"Auschwitz". Their BBS 'THE BEER BAR' appears to have the same phone number
as 'FIRE AND ICE' (sys: Imagic/2000 AD, later Sceptic). The Swedish section
was reborn late 94, by Randy (old handle Dot). Their swedish graphician
Penny is apparently female. News in Miracle's "Eternal #2" that Dot had
joined Balance was WRONG.
  1992 - Swedish swapper Goose joined DAI mid to late 92.
  1993 - Swapper Beast joined Cyborgs early 93. Dr.Mantrix left mid 93.
Bloody left mid to late 93. French trader Bombsquad left for Devils
late 93.

The German section was kicked.
Finnish swapper Zanu (93) joined Accession.
Turkish swapper Kickman (ex Centura) joined Miracle.
Turkish swapper Vigo left to form his own group 'Coroner'.

· AGA Dentro (AGA File).
  code: Micro, Astron, gfx: Turbo, Dyze (japfont), music: Gore/Zenon
  (main), DJ Jones (end).
  review: True to tradition, Bronx don't bother with irrelevant things
  like release dates; the effects suggest this is from the early AGA
  period, though, 1993 or 94. Who knows? None of the effects are
  particularly impressive; the best is the shadebob-like dot effect that
  form patterns; The rest are just block zoomrotators and dot-routines :(
· GLE tested A1200/030-50/2mb chip, 16mb fast/3.0.

  Istanbul Style (ECS Slideshow).

· Split 5+2=? (Intro).
  code: Malice, gfx: Eugene (raytrace), Malice (font), music: "Watch" by
  DJ Jones (Tracker Packer 3 format).
  review: This one-screen (not counting the fadeout spinning logo screen)
  BBS intro for the 'SPLIT 7' BBS (clever title, then!) comes without any
  kind of release date. It was uploaded to AmiNet in early 97, but the
  dates of the files in the archive are september 92...
    The rendered spinning Bronx logos are nice. The music is a sort of
  dance/techno hybrid with little variation or originality. Also, some sort
  of shadebobs variation is active behind the font of the writer.
· GLE tested A1200/030-50/2mb chip, 4mb fast/3.0.

  Faith of Black (1993, ECS File).
  code: Pentagram, MS, gfx: Turbo, Malice, Codian, music: Max.

  Portakal (1993, 03.06, ECS Intro).
  code: Pentagram, gfx: Surf's Rocker/Independent, Malice, music: Max.

· DJ Jones' Chip Pack #2 (1996, Musicfile).
  code/gfx: Malice, music: DJ Jones.
  review: Malice's cool graphics are the main attraction of this small
  chippack. I'm thoroughly unimpressed by DJ Jones' chiptunes, but then
  again I'm probably spoiled by all those great THX tunes I've been hearing
  lately... :) Anyway, get it for the cute gfx.

Browbeat
--------
FIN> Infinity (Juha Kouri, code, 94).

Browbeat is a Finnish group, probably with some relation to the finnish c64
demo group of the same name.
  Finnish coder Infinity is the author of JNet, a transfer program between
the Amiga and the Commodore 64. They were accused of spreading the BGS-9
virus for the amiga.


Brutal

The Soul (code) left the scene late 97, and Bucket died.


Budbrain Productions
--------------------
DEN> Diablo (Rene Bidstrup, music), Psycho (code).

Budbrain is the brainchild of the two Danish madmen Diablo and Psycho.
Their unique style of demos changed the face of scenery forever when they
unleased their first Megademo onto an unsuspecting public in 1990...and
the second one was also a big success.

Sonet left to join Vixen 09/92.

  Megademo (1990, 29.06, ECS Megademo, 2 disks).
  Winner of demo competition at the Amiga Conference 90.

  Megademo II (1990, 26.12, ECS Trackmo).

     entry]), Hotshot (music, 04/89), Jonez, JS (ex Dual Crew), Kannibal
     (ex Skid Row), Polo (music, 04/89), Radish (old handle Rogue, mid92).

Byterapers Inc. is a group with tradition; perhaps one of the oldest groups
on the entire demoscene! They used to be big on the C64, and I believe many
of their Amiga members are originally from the 64. Their Australian section
was formed late 1990. They have lately also been making PC demos with great
success!
