M.A.D (Mutual Assured Destruction) (-1990)
------------------------------------------
???> Axiom (04/90), Ezekimak, Fisc (crack, 03/90), Leaders in Crime (crack,
     aka LIC, 04/90), Pennywise, Skywalker, Sleeping Bag, Stinger,
     Stormlord, The Surge (crack).

Boards; DEVILS ISLAND WHQ (usa), INSTRUMENTS OF DARKNESS (usa), AMIGA EAST
     (usa), INVOLUNTARY DEATH (usa), SLEEPY HOLLOW (usa), CRYSTAL PALACE
     (n-l), PRISM BBS/FORGOTTEN MIND 3 (ita), IMAGEWORKS (eng).

M.A.D was another one of the better cracking groups, mainly based in France,
who ruled that part of the scene for a while. Their road to death started
after their WHQ (presumably DEVILS ISLAND?) left for Paranoimia. When they
died in mid 1990 (june or earlier!), its members formed a group called
Legend. However, they soon joined the forces of Paradox, another new group
formed by Trilogy together with ex-members of Kefrens and Rebels.


Mad Elks (MDE, -1996)
---------------------

     (gfx, ex Blaze), Z (gfx).

Mad Elks' reputation was largely built by their party-winning demo
"Technological Death" [05/93], which turned a few heads when it appeared.
They also spent a brief period as a subgroup of Mystic. Kopara was the
original organizer, and when he decided to stop that hard worrk in the
early part of 1994, Alis took over organizing. After a long time of
silence, Iron took the reins in 1995 and tried to build the group up to its
previous glory. In doing so, MDE finally exceeded the borders of Poland,
making new members in both Sweden and Germany. However, after Iron's
unsuccessful attempt to raise the group, most members left in favour of
other, more productive groups. Mad Elks is therefore dead, around mid 1996.

Polish swapper Action (ex Energy, new late95) joined Damage late 95.
Danish swapper Growl did NOT join.
Polish swapper Qwerty (ex Investation) joined Freezers.
Polish graphician Gunman joined Mystic.

  Winner of the Mountain Congress 93 demo competiton!
  review: One of the first techno demoes, carried largely by its music.
  It's got a groovy, thumping beat, and that's where most of the enjoyment
  lies with this. It's OK, but the skills of the other participants are
  sadly lacking, especially the graphicians. In the scroll they mention
  this is their second trackmo. Which was the first?

  Released at the 680xx Convention 1993.
  review: An impeccable invitation demo! There's not a lot to put your
  finger on here, it's all pretty good. Especially the tune has a great feel
  to it, but the design also helps. They mention a secret part, but I
  haven't been able to find it yet. The demo itself features no release
  date, but since the tune is dated .07 and the party is in October, all it
  takes is a little math.

Majic 12 will be remembered mainly for some half-decent demos, and for
their diskmag "Top Secret". They also released several acclaimed PC demos,
with the aid of their PC coder Maxwood. These demos also include graphics
by Rack etc., so they're well worth checking out!
  TV has been involved with a LOT of BBS'es (or just changed the name
frequently, what do I know?). I have a listing for a 'DAMAGING EVIDENCE'
board he cohosted with Revenger.
  1992 - Norwegian coder Flesh joined from New Wave around mid 92. The
diskmag "Top Secret" was handed over to the Danish division, and new editor
is TFG. A "Ray of Hope III" demo was planned (according to Balance's "Magbox
#1" [07/92]), but never saw the light of day...
  1993 - The French section - a.o. Baby (Fabien Guerin, org music, 04/93) -
was kicked mid 93. This probably also concerns  Hexogen (code), Magellan
(swap, 04/93), Mwaba (gfx, 04/93), Polaris (swap), Shean (gfx swap),
Thanbatos (gfx) and Zuul (music). Danish editor TFG (91-04/93) left after
finishing "Top Secret #15" [mid93]. Hungarian Zozo will probably be the new
main editor.

Suburban Base was founded 1994 by Swedish ex-members of Majic 12 (a.o.
  coder-musician Randall (old handle Zyx, 05/92-12/93) and Vision.
Hungarian organizer, swapper and sysop Zozo (Kozak Zoltan, 'MYSTERIOUS
  ISLAND' reopened ROM3/'REJTELMES SZIGET', 02/91-04/93) left the scene.
The Norwegian division was kicked, except for Dr.Bully, Heavy Mental and
  Vector. Musician Dr.Bully (04/93), the guy responsible for a.o. the
  soundtracks to the two "Ray of Hope" demos, left to join Cadaver (PRP4).
  Swapper Vector (04/93) was also later kicked, and I do not know what
  happened to H.M...
Dali joined Static Bytes and changed his handle to Daae.
Norwegian swapper and trader Razorblade (ex Interactive, new mid93) joined
  Balance.
Danish swapper Nighthawk (91-04/93) joined Rebels sometime between 04/93 and
  03/94. Rumours that he joined Iris are false.
Danish sysop Ramirez ('SUFFOCATION', ex Balance, 04/93) joined Fairlight.
Danes Chorus (music), Sid (music) and Condor (swap, all ex Quartz) joined
  the new Razor 1911.
Norwegian graphician Darkdude joined Shamrock.
Danish swapper Zinko (ex Deadlock, 05/92-04/93) joined Kefrens.
Hungarian superstar graphician Rack (02/91-04/93) joined Absolute early 93.
Guran joined Shining.
Norwegian coder and graphician Flesh (ex New Wave, new mid92-04/93) joined

Swedish graphician Eracore (new 91-04/93) left for TRSI. (is this right?)
Hitech and Norwegian The Laiter (gfx swap, 02/91) got kicked.
French musician Killerman is nowadays more known as Oxbow/Scoopex...

  review: Unfortunately I wasn't able to run this M12 demo. I tried both
  KillAGA and TUDE's degrade option, but it still kept guru'ing with a
  0000000E error. Too bad. The partial information is extracted from text I
  found in the depacked file.

  code: Avantage, Version, Ultravox, gfx: Rack, music: "Resonance II" by
  Dr. Bully. Winner of the C.C.C.P. Chromance Party 91!
  Review: The first thing that strikes me about RAY 2 is that the
  in-between font is very good. It's very Global Trash-y... Anyway, it
  opens with some blue/black interference, like in the original, followed
  by what it calls 'copper magic'. I rather like this effect, it's perhaps
  the best implementation ever, and the only part of the demo where the
  music coincides with the effects. If only the powerful part of the music
  had lasted a little longer... Next we're given what they call 'a boring
  sinusplotter'. They're right. Next is the real showstopper of the demo: a
  new kind of RGB plasma! Actually I don't think I've ever seen this effect
  replicated? Anyway, M12 were first! A very good effect, and one that
  makes this one notable. Next is another highlight; a BIG gorgeous logo by
  Rack. It's not hard to see why he became a living legend back in those
  days. The rest of the demo is rather unexciting. The tune is another
  thing worth noting here; it's a bizarre mixture indeed, ranging from
  great to just plain nondescript. The pan pipes have POWER; the pling-
  plong shit has only the power to irritate. Noteworthy, but not great.

  review: Techno-Intro is its name. I should perhaps mention that I hate
  techno? OK, I'll admit that I like SOME of the stuff - like Clawz' tunes.
  However, even I can hear the difference between original and downright
  'let's do what they do' tunes. This one falls into the latter category.
  The rest of this intro, though, is pretty un-techno. It's not UGLY, but
  won't set anyone on fire with enthusiasm either. It's a pretty standard
  little intro that's way too big for what it offers.

Masque was initially formed in 1992, as a demosection within TRSI. After a
year of this, they decided to try their luck on their own, and left TRSI -
taking all of TRSI's legal members with them! A pc section was formed in
1993, and you can see more of their accomplishments in Scenery pc :) The
amiga section was officially closed in the early part of 1995.

Matrix was a German demo group, which died in june 1996 after their leader
joined Riot, and Nero (gfx), Sharon (code) and Skyphos (code music) joined
Artwork. This robbed the group of most if not all of its best talent, and
there was no use to go on after this. Nero, Sharon and Skyphos later
reformed the group on the pc, with some success.

· Gom Jabbar (1996, 16.11, AGA Multifile).
  code: Sharon, Skyphos, gfx: Nero, music: Skyphos.
  Winner of Convention 96 demo competition!
  review: Matrix' first demo is technically advanced for sure, but how much
  does that help when certain effects move forward with an almost amazingly
  slow framerate? Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad demo at all - quite
  the contrary, in fact - but they should perhaps have spent some more
  time polishing and optimizing their effects. The graphics are great, tho.
    The music is worth an extra mention, since it sounds so amazingly
  clear and crisp - almost like it was coming out of my GUS ;) I don't
  personally care much for this kind of music, but the sound quality on
  this mod is rather great... I may be wrong, but my guess is it has
  something to do with 16 bit samples that are later converted...
    The guys who made this - Matrix' first demo - later joined Artwork and
  are now more or less Artwork's PC section.

· Frey (1996, 23.06, ECS 64k Intro).
  code: n/a, gfx: n/a, music: n/a. Released at the Polish Summer Party 96.
  review: "Frey" was Mawi's first ever intro, and unfortunately one that I
  just couldn't get to work properly on my machine. I first tried simply
  running it, and got the music correctly by just scrambled graphics. I
  rebooted and tried with KillAGA, but...I don't know, the music still
  plays, but now no visuals at all appear on my screen! Strange...
    Please note that the version reviewed is one that is 'a little fixed and
  refreshed', but still does not 'support' turbocards, in that they've used
  a blitter-c2p routine to support the older amigas.

  review: A nice idea, this is an intro based on an effect that is randomly
  generated each time it is executed. It is essentially a buce background
  effect with color-cycling under a few pages of nicely designed text
  telling the title and the name of the group. Perhaps not so great, but
  nice nevertheless... Two versions are included, one for 020+ fastmem
  machines, and one for all processors. The intro has even been tested by
  its makers on a bog standard a500 :)

They made demos, cracks (earliest: Tetris in february 1986!!) and utils.
In 1988 the French section, organized by Nasty Boy, got in trouble with the
Police over piracy. Therefore Ranger, the leader, decided to put MFC to
rest and start a new group. He formed Scoopex with several other ex-MFC
members, like Crazy Typer.

  Review: Infamia is a diskmag focusing on the scene of its native
  country, Italy. Graphically, it's unfortunately well below average.
  The code is also below average. It supports backgrounds, which is a
  good thing, but don't expect to see any clipart or anything like
  that.
    Navigation works pretty well by clicking on the directional
  buttons with your mouse, but the lack of keyboard shortcuts are almost
  unforgiveable. I can't comment on the editorial quality, since I do
  not speak Italian :) There doesn't seem to be enough articles, 'tho.

  Review: This second issue of Infamia opens with a much better title
  picture than last time, albeit from the same artist. The music also
  shows promise, and as I click my way into the mag itself, I can see
  that the panel graphics have also been replaced. The new ones are a
  lot better. Furthermore, they've abandoned their own main font for
  boring old Topaz 8, which is NOT such a good thing IMHO. A good font
  can almost give a mag an identity onto itself - just look at R.A.W.
    There's still no keyboard navigation, though.

  Review: With Infamia's third issue, it receives yet another welcome
  facelift. The first and most imminent change is that the old intro's
  gone! Instead, we now find a new one, made for the Infamia guys by
  Lustrones. It's pretty good, and does that job it needs to do. But
  after the intro is over, do we go directly to the mag? NO! Instead,
  there's a brand new section - the gallery! This one has a pretty OK
  logo on top, a chip-happy tune of the oldschool variety, and lots of
  B&W pictures of Italian sceners. It was done by Biosynthetic Design.
    Then the mag itself: It opens with the best intro logo they've had
  so far; metallic cogwheels in the background and INFAMIA in the
  foreground in very 'heavy metal' characters. It looks raytraced.
  And then the mag itself...WOW! Colorful, great looking panels on show
  here, and a reggae-like tune that's great to mellow out to. For the
  first time reading Infamia, I SERIOUSLY regret it's in Italian :)
  There's still not a lot of articles, but I expect what's there is
  pretty good. I browse the mag, looking at some articles and
  immediately notice the incredibly smooth transitions and the new font.
  INFAMIA is a mag that's grown up, and is ready to leave its parents
  and live in the world on its own. Never mind if you can read Italian,
  check it out!

  Review: The worst thing about this, to start, is the graphics. I'm sorry,
  people, but you need to get better painters! The graphics here are just
  not up to scratch... Try to draw individual pixels next time, and go a
  little easier on the smoothing tools :)
    The code is not the best either, it's the usual C2P stuff. We've seen
  it a million times, and almost always better than this. The music suffers
  from the same syndrome, actually. Been there, heard that a million times.
  Originality and quality is what these guys need to look into. It's like
  they've tried to make the demos they love themselves, but haven't got
  the talent or the skill. Still, practice makes perfect. The bad news is
  that these guys will need a lot of practice.

  review: Wow, this is an awesome demo... "Dose" is certainly one of the top
  three demos of 1997! From the very first beats of the strong, fiery
  introduction sequence you know you're looking at something professional
  here... There is some truly amazing, groundbreaking 3d in this demo,
  routines that are worthy of demos on pcs with twice the horsepower of my
  humble 030-50! Sure, not _everything_ runs at 60fps, not _everything_ is
  1x1, but it just doesn't seem to matter much as you sit there with your
  mouth open and stare at the awesome display on the screen. Let me just
  mention the especially impressive transparency and lighting routines, and
  the professional, catchy soundtrack before I leave you to go download this
  great demo for yourself. If you don't you'll have missed one of the best
  ever demos for this machine! Go!
    Dose was released for TRSI. You can decide the mixing frequency of the
  OctaMED SoundStudio soundtrack yourself, and I watched it with the
  recommended mixing frequency for 030 machines of 15000. Minimum processor
  requirements are just 020, but they recommend at least 040-40.

  Winner of The Gathering 98 demo competition!
  review: Rise is a massive, 5.5MB demo that will blow your socks off! Not
  as truly spectacular, perhaps, as last year's winner "Captured Dreams",
  this does offer some unparallelled 3d scene rendering on the Amiga.
  I have seen demos like this before, but only on heavily accelerated
  Pentium PC's... We get to follow a woman clad in a VERY yellow bikini,
  travelling Tomb Raider-style through several scenes. The best part is
  where she dives through a waterfall to some beautiful scenery below, and
  in a spectacular finale is lifted towards the sky in a beam of brightly
  lit colors. All this and a very scary snake make this one the strongest
  demos of 1998 so far. The music is great, the graphics are at times
  excellent.
    Rise has Risen, and Mellow Chips should change their name to Extreme
  Chips! Though the demo will theoretically run on 020 machines, at least
  030-50 is recommended. The demo seemed unstable on my machine, crashing
  twice in the time I used to test it.

Melon Dezign was formed by Paleface and Seen after they left Quartex, as a
demo and intro subgroup of the cracking crew Crystal. They eventually left
their mothergroup Crystal to exist on their own, but I believe the game
development company Lionheart consists of Melon Dezign members. They've
produced an amazing array of crackintros over the years, most of them for
Crystal, but also for a.o. Ministry.
  1992 - Hitman was kicked due to lazyness early 92. In december, the french
members (at least Performer and Walt) went to The Party with a brand new
trackdisk demo... But after talking to Lone Starr/Spaceballs and seeing
"State of the Art" Performer decided not to release it...and the demo was
lost forever =( This story was related to me by Performer, so it's
definitely true.

Danes Slammer (code, new early 93), Xience (gfx, new early 93) and Solnova

Danish musician Hithansen, who originally joined from Rednex, left them for

French coder Performer (Renaud Lerouvreur, ex Anarchy, 04/92-94) left the
  Amiga scene for the PC. I've seen his cool intro "Red" for Razor 1911 on
  the PC, which he made with Zebig and TDK; other Amiga abandonees. He left
  behind some great demos for Melon, most notably "Humantarget" [04/92].
English musician Mark Knight (formerly known under the handle TDK; The Dark
  Knight, ex Anthrox) left the scene after securing a job in the game
  industry. He is now the English in-house musician at Mindscape.
  His work can be heard in games like Battletoads (amiga), Sim City 2000

  review: Oozing style and fun from every pore, this is another great
  little intro from Melon. This is perhaps their first real production, as
  it at least mentions the forming of Melon by Paleface and Seen. It opens
  with a nice logo, continues quickly with the three arrangers' names being
  smashed up, and finally concludes in a text selection menu done in the
  usual offbeat Melon way (this had some graphical errors on the
  backgrounnd, but was still perfectly readable). There is also a small
  'bonuspart', with some text and a logo at the right hand side. The music
  is very nice.
    When I first tried to run this intro from DOpus it crashed my machine
  for real (00000004). I then tried to run it from the disk (caches off),
  and then it did work.

  freezes after the 'melon.' logo bounces on the jelly vector. Too bad,
  since what I saw was really great! Caches off doesn't help, naturally.
  I'll get back to you when I get my hands on an inferior meachine :D
    I have often seen this misspellt, where the title is split into two
  words, 'Human Target'. Fact is that everywhere it appears in the demo
  (at least the parts I've seen :) it's in one word.
    Performer told me that the demo does not work on A1200's, likely because
  of an interrupt problem. It should work satisfactorially in emulators.

  bad to excellent. The best pictures (IMHO) are Sarah-Yama, Spiritual
  Melon, Medusa and Liquor Caza. Some of these pictures have been seen
  before, ofcourse, a.o. in Alliance Design's demo "Substance" [04/91].
    Mentioned in the Bomb intro as having a release date 'around September'.
  No apparent problems with running, apart from the fact that the intro
  runs so fast the pink elephants don't quite have time to come onscreen
  before the menu appears. Also, the music bugs a little.

  style opening picture of a man with an excessively large nose. It goes
  on with traditional Ukulele weeeeeird music to a text writer, with some
  messages like 'My conscience is clear. I never use it.' The music picks
  up speed as a 1-bitplane representation of a woman spins in the
  background, until it finally reaches its cresencendo and - IT'S
  SUPERWOMAN! Enough said.

  review: Melon presents an excellently made intro here, with very nice
  graphics. The 'childish' style suits them to a tee, and gives an overall
  feel of something a little different. Nice. This intro is also known as
  'Cannabis', probably because the executable file name is Cannabis.exe.
    The intro never mentions a release date or even in what year this is
  supposed to take place. However, the line 'AGA has been out for a year
  now' seems to indicate this is from 1994.

  your cup of tea, then this little number will be sure to satisfy.
  Rather than have all the music in a single mod, for some reason it's here
  in three parts... The great end picture by Joachim was reviewed in an old
  issue of ROM... All parts can be paused with the right mouse button.

  review: Women will not appreciate this demo. There are a few things in
  here that are in bad taste... and that goes for the design as well as the
  sexist stuff! But really, the naked women were unnecessary. As for the
  rest of the demo... The first part is best. The way the Melon logo
  dissolves and the animated women's faces in consistence with the music is
  a very good beginning. It created an atmosphere which was totally crushed
  seconds later by a tasteless loading picture. Shame on you, Melon.
    The music is a hard-hitting demo tune in the tradition of Jesper Kyd or
  Static, and does its job well. Shame about the rest of the demo.
  It actually won a demo competition, beating another Melon demo, BAYGON,
  which came 2nd. The competition must have been abysmal. Does this really
  require AGA?

  review: How anyone could prefer badly digitized ugly naked women to this
  is beyond me. This is a much better demo than Planet M, who won the
  competition! Where Planet M is tasteless, Baygon is brimming with style!
  It's a celebration of times gone of sorts, with some Space Invaders
  imagery etc. present. If the producers of Planet M and this had joined
  together to create ONE demo, just think what a great Melonstration it
  could have been!
    The music is just a sample loop with some vocals, which gets repetitive
  too quickly. A little variation would have been in order.

Ministry was the new 'big' cracking group formed by previous members of
Crack Inc., Nemesis (Action Man, N.O.M.A.D, Zelnik) and TKK (Obituary) in
1992 when those groups fell apart. The group had members in Belgium, USA,
Germany and the UK. They were probably the strongest cracker group since
Crystal and the old Skid Row. For a while, Vanish was their demo division.
After Ministry died, Scottish supplier (and one of the founders) Action Man
left the scene.
  1993 - This year the group's UK Section released what was probably the
first ever crack of an AGA game; "Zool A1200".

  side. Classic chiptune by Heatbeat. This review is duplicated in Melon's
  entry, without information specific to Ministry.
    Used for Ministry's crack of Reach for the Skies (supplied by Kitaro).
  It is highly likely that this intro was only used by the German section.

  review: With the second issue of Eternal, Kris & Orion have certainly made
  a solid product IMHO. Everything looks top-notch, from the 'feel' of the
  mag to the excellent graphics. There is perhaps not enough clipart, but
  apart from that - no complaints. Contents look well organized, with about
  a 50-50 mix of interesting and not so interesting articles. The music is
  excellent, though a little on the short side for a diskmag tune. There are
  also a few interesting attempts at development here, for example in the
  animated backgrounds of the charts section, and the animated bullets used
  in some of the articles. The thing that makes these work here is that
  they're only used sparingly, and never defracts from the reading
  experience. There are a couple of mistakes in the news section (Dot never
  left Bronx, Skywalker joined Cryptoburners and not Crusaders, BARON
  R5/Desire should be Ramon B5...), and a few instances of news that are
  close to a year old, but then again what mag can claim not to have one or
  two of those? It is a little irritating though, since it makes it hard to
  trust these news... A very nice, if not groundbreaking mag. Approved.

Mirage will probably be most remembered as the group behind the message mag
'Chit Chat', and the group where Danny released his slideshow :)
  1995 - Dutch swapper Sascha left for Mellow sometime between january and
april. The year's first issue of Chit-Chat was released on the first of
april, with a new coeditor - Magic from Applause, previous editor of
Applause's mag "Thing". He was later kicked out, and joined TRSI. Some
controversy   has been surrounding Magic, and Mirage even released an
'anti'-intro, saying how unthrustworthy he is (see article in ROM5).

Dutch graphician Danny joined Anarchy. He released a slideshow called
  "Forgotten" (92) in Mirage before leaving.

  review: CC #8 opens with a STUNNING title picture by Hof, and continues
  into a nice magpart. The font is not unlike the eurocharts font, and is
  nicely readable in pastel colors. Jester is one of my favourite musicians,
  but his tune for this mag is a little bland... This is really a
  messagebox, but this time features some cool articles too... The pictures
  at two sides of the panel is a real nice idea, and affords the mag some
  identity of its own! Nicely done, with more to read this would be a GREAT
  mag! Worth the download for the picture alone.
    Some text in the mag suggests an intro by Crackerjack, but I have only
  the mag executable...

  review: CC has become a nicely designed diskmag, with a good selection of
  articles. The mag's original messagebox functions are now more of an
  afterthought than the real attraction. The size of the mag is a problem,
  though, with the relatively low amount of articles and just one tune, this
  mag should NOT take more than a single disk...instead it fills nearly two!
  We suspect the gallery section has a lot of the blame for this...

  Review: This demo is split into two parts. First there's a demo of a game
  they're making, which runs for a little while before it boots the main
  demo part. Nothing outstanding about the demo as such, it's just an
  average no-frills production.
    Compatibility proved to be a problem. It works fine (except for a few
  graphical and musical errors in the game part) for a good while into the
  demo part. Then it suddenly just guru's without further warning.

Movement was formed by 911 and Meegosh from Rebels in January of 1993.
They consist of most of the active part of the old Rebels, which in time
caused Rebels to die. Ofcourse, Rebels was reborn in 1994, and they're
still around! Solnova works at Funcom, I presume, since that's where his
e-mail address is... Milkshake was never a member! ROM4 mentioned that
contra to popular belief, Meegosh is still active.
  Corny works for Funcom, after finally leaving the army, but still seems
to be able to find some time for the scene every now and then.

French graphician Hof (ex The Silents, new early93) joined Melon Dezign.
Dutch organizer and swapper Astro (ex Rebels, new SLH11, 12/93) who was a
  Movement and CNCD doublememb, left them both for Virtual Dreams

  review: Certainly an unusual demo, COOKY opens with a reasonably

  The rest of the demo is just some text screens with small drawings and
  different fonts over a background. It's nicely designed, and fun, but
  in the end nothing you'll remember for a long time.
    On my machine, the demo refused to play the soundtrack. I tried it
  with both KillAGA from DOpus and booting with OCS and caches off, but
  the problem remained. Otherwise, no problems were encountered.
  The music, for the record, is great!

  review: Numb's best features is its excellent design, with great graphics
  and backgrounds by Alex. The code isn't really very advanced at all, but
  it's entertaining and polished. Music is also very acceptable. Some of
  the routines on offer is a magnifying lens, a greatlooking parallel
  horizontal graphics twister and a vector cube effect, where all the sides
  are transparent and their color reflects on the bacground picture of an
  angel. Still, as mentioned the real star of the show is the graphics.
  Text in the demo mentions it was released for The Party 93 demo
  competition, yet it appears on no result lists! Can anyone clear up this
  mystery for me?
    While the demo itself works perfectly on my setup, the hidden part
  - accessed by pressing the left mousebutton while booting, the bootblock
  text says - crashes the machine spectacularly.

Mystic was formed in the early 1990s by Axe, and was a mainly illegal/modem
based crew until the establishment of their demo section in Poland,
organized by XTD. Since then the demo section has been reinforced with
talented members from Finland, Norway and Denmark. When Axe decided to
stop, the dutch Killraven took over, and today Mystic is organized by Finn
Quartz. Easy Rider, the original Polish organizer, has now started a Mystic
on the PC too, which has nothing to do with the rest of the group.
  Their recruitment of the french division of Essence, producers of the two
excellent demos "Makaveli" and "Thug Life", was a brief experience since
they decided to leave again, to reform their old group Skarla! Their
DayDream door division consisted of Peja, Easyrider and Yasiu.
  1995 - Polish graphician CIA (03/95) joined Freezers early in the year.
Finnish musician Slice (new between 05 and 08/95) joined Nerve Axis  late in
the year, and has since risen to fame in that group under the name Ganja.
  1996 - Seb McKein joined Asphyx in june.
  1997 - Visual (gfx) left for Freezers.
  1999 - With the release of their 3rd placed "Megademo" [08/99] at Assembly
99, they announced that this was their very last ever production on the
amiga. They are therefore declared dead as an amiga group.

The board 'THE CRYING FIELDS', and swedish sysop Borre ('OUT OF SPACE',

Jeremy (doublememb from Mad Elks) left the scene.
Polish graphician Yoga joined Freezers.
English musician Hydlide joined Defekt.

· Dirt (ECS Trackmo).
  code: MSS, gfx: CIA, Gunman, music: XTD.
  review: This is an obscure little demo, which contain no release date
  whatsoever! What it does contain is lots and lots of linebased vector,
  a single filled vector cube and (the best thing here) a fullscreen rot-
  zoomer, which should give us some indication of its age... XTD can do a
  lot better music than this!
    Please note that this review caters for a version prepared for
  HD install, released to AmiNet by a third person. It is therefore not
  give an impression of the compatibility of the original trackmo.

  review: Seeing Vital, I can't help but think Charon got a few ideas from
  some of 1993's better demos and intros - like Kefrens' "Desert Dream" and
  Virtual Dreams' "Chaosland". Still, that doesn't necessarily make for a
  bad demo - just a boring one. Technically, I suppose there's nothing
  really wrong, it's just a little identity-less. It's got no SOUL.
    My conclusion would have to be: Competent coding, but unoriginal and a
  little boring. Try again, though. :)

· Atom (1994, 12.08, AGA 40k Intro).
  code: CBM80, gfx: Gunman, music: XTD (ProPacker 2.1 format).
  Released at Intel Outside I Party.
  review: Early AGA intro shows coders exploring possibilities of the new
  architecture. It opens with an opening logo by Gunman, before we're
  treated to a good raytraced animation...with a twist! In fact the
  animation is blown up, while a 1x1 rendition bounces around all over it.
  Next we're shown a 256 color greyscale highres keftales effect (plasma-
  like). Then we're given the credits, which is the last part. It consists
  of just a text writer and some globes bouncing around. Overall not a bad
  intro, though it's a little short. XTD's music is kind of squeaky.
    They say it's the first production from ex-Beta Team members after they
  joined Mystic. Since Gunman joined from Mad Elks, does this only refer to
  CBM80 and XTD? Please note that this review refers to the fixed version,
  not the party version. As far as I know, the only difference between the
  two are in the music replay routine. If you have the fixed version, the
  text-writer at the end says so.

  review: An amazingly enerving assault of fuzzy guitars is the one thing
  you'll remember about "The Mask" - long after the memory of block
  rotzoomers, bad 'wolfenstein' routines (walls only) and actually rather
  nice dots have faded. Quite fun that 'insert disk 2' joke, though.... It
  all ends with an upscroller with an ok, blue mystic logo gracing the top
  of the screen. The original 'metal' tune is replaced with a similarly
  irritating chiptune. For some reason there is NO exit for this intro.
  Works on unexpanded A1200s.

  Winner of the Primavera 95 demo competition!
  review: "IP" is a demo that throws stuff at you constantly, keeping a high
  pace throughout the demo. Having said that, this is an uneven production,
  with lots of - but no real amazing - graphics. The raytraced, colorful
  tunnel (done by Reset) looks cool, and there are lots of variations on the
  rotzoom principle here - including a real impressive fullscreen one that
  also waves sideways! Well, it's hard to describe, download the demo and
  see for yourselves ;) Above average, but lacks a little freshness.
    Originally intended for distribution on two disks, but easily
  installable on  harddisk with a few short assigns. Will work fine on

  review: This was to be reviewed soon anyway, as I was working my way

  In this article, lots of people were singing the praise of this demo,
  complaining it didn't do better in the competition. My curiosity was
  sparked, and thus I had to transfer it to my Amiga and take a peek...and
  I can but join the chorus. This _IS_ a great demo, and deserving of any
  praise it gets! The star of the show here is undoubtedly SHD. This is
  certainly a coder for the future, no doubt about that! There are some
  amazing effects here, like the money bills dropping from the top of the
  screen, to the water effects and those calculated whatchercallems full
  screen thingies that look like something being poured into water and
  slowly dissolving...
    Some criticism was directed at the music in ROM's article, but I only
  halfway agree. I think the first tune (by Archangel?) is a good,
  functional demo tune combining the beat popularized by latter-day demos
  with some of the groove of earlier demo tunes... The second tune,
  however, never really came alive for me. Still, taste varies...
    Here's some additional 'technical' information, again from the ROM
  article: All routines run in 256 color in 256x256 resolution, except the
  texture tunnel and room, which is actually a 'scene' from the raytracing
  program Lightwave. The demo REQUIRES a 030-50, and was made with the 060
  owner in mind. Also requires some fastmem. Lazur's two pictures can also
  be seen in his "Wild" (1996) slideshow for Anadune.

  9th in the Gravity 96 4k intro competition.
  review: A rather uninspired affair, this intro just features a spinning
  sphere with the full mandelbrot fractal set texturemapped on each tile.
  A small text says '4K Intro by Mystic' in the top left corner, and that's
  all there is. Disappointing. No credits appear in the intro or the file.

· Fat (1997, 09.08, 64k Intro).
  code: Geezer, gfx: Czar, music: Dune.
  3rd in the Assembly 97 64k intro competition.
  review: This intro opens with blue/white blurred linevectors spinning
  around arranged into somekind of a shape, and after a little while a white
  MYSTIC logo with blurred blue edges appear at the bottom of the screen.
  Next comes a travel through a fastmoving, flashing tunnel - an effect the
  intro holds onto for much too long long! Then a screen with the names of
  the three makers appear, before we return to the tunnel which is now cube-
  shaped. Then we see the word FAT with a flashing object moving behind it,
  before the show ends with the opening effect recycled with a new palette.
  To make a long story short, this is an intro that I'm having problems
  getting excited over; the pace is too slow and the effects are not
  impressive. One thing I do wonder about is the musician for this project;
  was legendary finnish musician Dune a member of Mystic at this time?

  review: This minimalistic, grey intro opens with some "tvnoise" in the
  background and a Mystic logo. It moves on into a 3d scene/tunnel (in grey)
  which is blocky but fast, then some credits (over tvnoise). Next is
  something that's probably supposed to be a scene (in grey), but looks more
  like a rotzoomer before we flash onto a - grey - tunnel scene with a
  blinding light at both ends. Then it all ends with an Azuli logo over -
  you guessed it - some grey tvnoise. I'm depressed now.

  review: Mystic's final ever amiga demos opens with Lazur's picture
  "Pegazus" (done in 1995), of a girl riding on a blindfolded unicorn. Then
  the credits, and next is a picture of a cybered-up Bill Gates, with the
  words "resistance is futile" overlaid on the soundtrack...then the demo
  starts proper with another picture of Gates - derived from a german
  wartime poster of Adolf Hitler leading his troops but with Gates' face
  superimposed and the windows logo standing in for the swastika - over
  which texturemapped money drops realisticially from the top of the screen.
  This demo uses more than a few effects recycled from their classic
  "Traffic" [08/96], as you will soon understand :). Next is a nice but
  blovcky envmap routine overlaid on a tunnel with 3d stars travelling
  towards you - just slightly sad that they use the classic duck.3ds object,
  which has only been used about a thousand times before...
    Next up is an "afterburned particle" (well, that's the best name I could
  think of, OK? =D) routine, which is also (if memory serves me right)
  recycled from "Traffic". Onto a cool ripple effect as we fly around a
  blown-up version of Lazur's "Whirl" picture (of a 'boat' on a stormy sea,
  also from 1995) and finally the full picture. Next we get one more envmap
  object, this time in 1x1 resolution without the tunnel and with
  shinepoints, before the demo ends with an upscroll...a sad one. It
  announces that this will be Mystic's last ever amiga demo, and the
  background picture signals the shape of platforms to come. SHD even
  manages to deliver the final insult; saying 'AMIGA IS DEAD'. I like your
  demo SHD; but not your attitude :( Was Lazur really a member here?
    No information on the memory or machine limitations either in the demo
  or the accompanying text files. Surely needs some fast.
