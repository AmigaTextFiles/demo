Oblivion (OBL, 1992-)
---------------------
DEN> Drain (gfx, 02/94), Primitive (gfx, 02/94).

Oblivion was a danish demo group, born on the ashes of Vixen when they died.
Waldi is now Bird/Iris.
  1994 - Danish coder Boogeyman (ex Vixen, new 92) joined Passion in
october. Danish musician Ramosa (04/94-) left for Passion sometime between
august and november.

· The Last A500 (1994, .02, ECS Intro).
  code: Boogeyman, gfx: Drain, Primitive, music: Ramosa (The Player 5.0A
  format).
  review: The Last A500 is a nice, small, polished production from these
  danes - it feels professional from the get go! It's over pretty fast,
  'tho. It resets the machine when it is done. It was almost certainly not
  released at a party. The release date is approximate, based on the release
  date of other productions on the same pack where I found this.
    It was Boogeyman's last ECS production ever.

· Wonderland (1994, 07.08, AGA 40k Intro).
  code: Boogeyman, gfx: Pride/Stellar, music: Ramosa.
  review: Apparently their first AGA production, since the introduction
  says 'Oblivion goes AGA!'. This is another one of those early AGA prods,
  which meant everyone was using LOTS of colors! Personally, I love almost
  each and every one of those. People were experimenting with their new
  hardware, doing new cool stuff all the time. No points for guessing I'm
  looking forward to the PowerPC scene :)
    Design is impeccable here, about as good as it gets. Coding is also
  great, but then AGAin we're talking about Boogeyman here. Niceness!

  code: Krustur, Morot, gfx: Sun, Chrombacher (font), music: Destructor.
  Released for the Virtual Conspiracy 95 40k intro compo, but unplaced.
  review: To the tones of the very c64-like chiptune, the intro starts
  nicely with a stretching zoomrotator. It goes on to a *LOT* of dots
  travelling around the screen in some shapes...and that's it. It goes no
  further than that, just keeps on showing off those dots. Unbelievably
  limited, unfortunately, since what's there is quite competent.

Offence [old] (1991-1992)
-------------------------
NOR> Comajim (Joachim Rott, music, ex New Wave, new mid92), Vimme (gfx, ex
     New Wave, new mid92-07/92).

Offence was a norwegian demo group formed by Jawbreaker, Pal and Perplex
late 1991 or early 92. They recruited some of the best members from New Wave
in the middle of 1992, and seemed to be headed for greatness. When the group
feel apart, several of the members found their way to the commercial
gamesmaking business instead of back to the scene in new groups. Norwegian
coders Jawbreaker (Anders Dybdahl, ex Scoopex) and Lord Mindless (ex Dual
Crew, 07/92) both started working on commercial projects, and RamJet/PMC
(now Spaceballs) was involved with Jawbreaker's latest game. Another one of
the founders, the Norwegian graphician Pal (ex Scoopex) left the scene to do
graphics for Nintendo games. The group died due to 'internal problems'.

After Offence died, Norwegians Fairfax (gfx, ex PMC, new RAW3, 07/92),
  Lizard (music, ex Megastyle Inc, new RAW2) and Moxy (swap, ex Cytax, new
  RAW3) all joined Andromeda late 92.
Norwegian Peavey joined Devils.
Norwegians Lion (ex Vision, new RAW3), Jawbreaker (ex Scoopex) and
  Vigilante (trade) joined Alliance. For more on Jawbreaker, see the
  history section of this entry.
Amitech, sysop 'THE PHANTOM ZONE', ex Vision, new RAW3, left the scene.
Swedish sysops Bill and Ted ('CRIME ZONE', ex Skid Row ) joined Quartex
  (RAW4).
Norwegian cracker Rex (new RAW2) sold his machine and left the scene
  (RAW4). However, the same mag later claimed he changed his name to Rook
  and joined Andromeda... (RAW5).
Two of the people closely involved with R.A.W, coeditor Kingpin (ex New
  Wave, new RAW3) and coder Perplex (ex Scoopex), joined Pure Metal Coders
  (RAW4^STD10).
Ceel is not and will never be in Offence! (RAW3).
Norwegians Rob and Timewalker (both ex The Silents, new RAW2) rejoined The
  Silents (RAW3).

  Sourcery (1992, 15.04, ECS Demo).
  3rd in The Gathering 92 demo competition.


Offence [new] (1994-)
---------------------
NOR> Nick (Anders Nordby, founder swap, ex Spaceballs, new 12/93-
     04/99), Nosferatu, Pal (gfx, 04/97), Perplex (Lars Haugseth, code, ex
     Spaceballs, 05/95).
GER> Arrogance (gfx music, 04/97), Drake (ex Razor Dezign), Sim (ex Razor
     Dezign), Yup (Andreas Schneider, code, 04/97).

Nick left Spaceballs after The Party 3 to rebuild Offence, and is as such
the only founder of the new Offence. Perplex is perhaps best known as the
coder of legendary diskmag 'R.A.W'.

· No Sleeping! (1994, 03.04, ECS 40k Intro).
  code: Perplex, gfx: Pal, music: Lizard/Spaceballs.
  4th in The Gathering 94 40k intro competition.
  review: The only halfway interesting effect in this intro has the be the
  twisting scroller in the endpart, which was nicely executed. Other than
  that, this is strictly boring as fuck. I guess Perplex should stick to
  coding diskmags :)

  Prodigy/Oops! (THX format).
  review: Now, -THIS- practically REEKS of C64 quality! This is far from a
  perfect production, but it doesn't really matter. It's the atmosphere.
  Technically it's a THX music disk, with music by some of that scene's
  most talented players. Not all of the music is equally good, though; some
  of Arrogance's tunes are less than perfect. But these minor shortcomings
  are more than made up for by the amazing c64 graphics - made on a real
  c64 by a real c64 graphician. This is not Amiga sceners trying to 'do the
  c64'. This is c64 sceners 'doing the Amiga' - while avoiding compromise.
    If I have to criticize something here, then the control method for
  selecting tunes and text is a little hard to control at times, and some
  of the effects on the text pages can make them harder to read. But these
  are minor issues; download and enoy!

· Moments (1995, .04, AGA File).
  code: Hudi, gfx: Zefir, Sabe (design), music: Scorpik (P60A format).
  2nd in the Eastern Conference 95 demo competition.
  review: Oh yes! This demo managed to excite me a little. From the moment
  we hear the first bars of the music, to the moment I first saw Bambi, I
  knew I was in for a ride. It opens with some Color blur effect, which
  aren't that interesting, but the next effect sure is. What the demo calls
  Cube Cut is actually two lightsourced vector cubes spacecut with each
  other. A very nice-looking effect. The show continues with stuff like a
  fullscreen 2x2 zoom rotator that rotates a Predator face; some SLOW
  Goraud shading (though they admit it themselves); a FAST linedraw routine
  that throws some lines around the screen; texturemapped 'black hole'
  effect and a colorful waving chessboard, like in Sanity's "WOC '92".
    Throughout the demo, Scorpik's tune is superbly timed to the routines.
  I think this tune is one of the most flawless demo tunes I've heard in
  recent years; it sort-of reminds of me of early Lizardking (cirka
  Wild Impressions 2), which can not be a bad thing. The thing that REALLY
  charmed me about this demo, though, was the cuuuute graphics by Zefir.
  He produces three fullscreen pictures for this demo (excluding the Old
  Bulls logo), all of which are cute and good. The entire demo opens with
  the title screen, which in addition to saying Moments also features a
  Bambi-like deer drinking water. Towards the middle there's a picture of
  comic book character Asterix, and the entire demo is rounded off with a
  picture of a kitten. Very very cuute all of them.
    The party report says it's a cooperation demo with Tilt, while the
  demo itself never mentions Tilt at all. The format of the file is a
  little interesting. It's got a header, uncrunched, but with lots of
  Crunchmania data files making up the rest of the file. Perhaps it's
  designed like that to make it memory-economic or to prevent depacker-
  ripping... It doesn't stop WRip though :)

· Fade (1995, 30.08, AGA 64k Intro).
  code^gfx: Sabe, music: Scorpik (The Player 6.0A format).
  3rd in the Intel Outside 95 64k intro competition.
  review: "Fade" opens with some jumping vector planes, which soon starts
  showing off their many colors to create a nice display. Next is a gouraud
  shaded vector city, much like the one in Pygmy Projects "Extension"
  (08/93), only this one is smaller and MOVES a less like a city :)
  An apple is up next, and it seems to be z-buffer shaded instead of the
  earlier gouraud. I know I've seen this apple object in other demos, so
  it's probably a common object... The thing that makes this intro, really,
  is Scorpik's fabulous trancy, thumping, wild but disciplined techno tune.
  I don't think the intro would have had this much impact without that
  tune. Luckily for us, it HAS that tune, hehe... 64k and lots of
  entertainment - go download this.

Oxygene (OXG, 1994-1996)
------------------------
FRA> Niko (Carre Nicolas, gfx, 09/94), Wilfried (Sechet Alban, gfx, 09/94).

Oxygene came onto the Amiga demo scene as a breath of fresh air in 1994, as
the first crew (as far as I know) to come to the Amiga from the Atari scene.
After giving us a host of great demos, they would once again decide to move
onto another platform in early 1996, this time the dreaded PC. Among the
great demos the left behind, we find such classics as "Control" [08/95] and
"Vision" [12/95]. With them to the pc scene went all their best members,
including coder Oxbab and graphicians Spiral and Mon. These people certainly
left for the PC section: Data (swap), Lester (code), Mon (gfx), Nap, Oxbab
(code), Spiral (gfx) and Leonard (code).
  Leonard worked on the game "Shaq Fu" for the Sega Megadrive, and
participated on the game "Fade To Black" on the pc, and is working for
Delphine Software. Spiral is working for Cryo. Oxbab did the 3d real time
introduction for "Captain Blood" on the Macintosh.
  1995 - After his final demo work for Oxygene, "Indigo" [12/94], french
musician Smith (Delteil Herve) left the scene in the first half of 1995.

  3rd in the Saturne party II demo competition.
  review: Oxygene's first production on the Amiga is an OK demo, that I
  immediately mistook for an AGA production when the first logos appeared
   on screen. I like the music in this one, it's got a dynamic feel that
  really suits the demo. Also, there's advanced shading and texturemapped
  cubes here - unusual for an ECS demo from 1994!

                Note: Seems to work fine, except for long pause towards
                end, and what appears to be graphical errors on the end
                picture. Running it with KillAGA revealed a zoom-rotator

· Ride (1994, 07.08, AGA 40k Intro).

  review: Mighty! Only their second production, and already they're
  impressing the pants off me! Why is it called 'Ride' indeed...
  You MUST check out the vector flight through a tunnel on this one!
  Sort of reminds you of the 'deathstar' scene in Star Wars, doesn't it?
    There's a hidden screen, saying 'DON'T VOTE FOR US' - don't know how
  to reach it though...Haven't tried that hard either :)

  review: Not bad, this demo, and a taster of things to come. The graphics,
  especially the stuff from Niko, is quite good. I love his logos and the
  'tongue' picture. The music is quite acceptable in my ears, though
  nothing outstanding. As for the code, it's competent, but not great.
  There's no 'wow' stuff in here, if you know what I mean.
    I am NOT sure whether this is an AGA or ECS production...All the
  pictures suggest an ECS prod., while some of the effects are usually
  reserved for AGA-equipped Amigas... Anyone?

  code: Oxbab, Leonard (additional), Lester (additional), gfx: Spiral, Mon,

  review: Not as immediately appealing as "Cuzco", this is still a very
  good demo. There's some nice looking effects, like the fire stuff and a
  slight innovation: spacecut between a gouraud object and a texture mapped
  one. There seems to be an abundance of Oxygene and Indigo logos here;
  almost every effect has some sort of graphic inbetween them! Graphically,
  Niko continues to impress with his cool logos.
    The booting picture, "Retina" by Spiral, competed in the graphics
  competition at the same party. Like in "Another Dream Now", Smith delivers
  two tunes; A main tune and a calmer endtune. It's not terribly good,
  though, much more forgettable than his cool tune for "Cuzco".

  Winner of the GASP Party 95 demo competition!
  review: Certainly a winner, this, from the ever-improving Oxbab. This one
  is centered around several different vector environments that you're
  flying through. The graphics are quite OK, and the main soundtrack is the
  usual techno from Clawz, followed by a calm tune in the endpart.
  Very good. Does not support external drives.

  code: Oxbab, gfx: Niko, Mon, Spiral, music: "Hibakusha" by Clawz/Bomb

  review: This is a very good demo, actually, with a couple of showstopping
  effects. The dungeon anim towards the end is cool, as is the 'Wipeout'
  part and the running vector man. These two last parts shows a sense of
  innovation, which we're not too used to :) The soundtrack is the usual
  techno, but Clawz does it better than most as usual. He has a quality
  that adds a certain groove to everything... Sadly, this was to become
  Oxygene's final release on the Amiga; their next release was the otherwise
  excellent "Contrast" (04/96) on the pc.
    Requires some fast, but accompanying text file says fixed version for
  standard A1200 will be released early 96. The version reviewed is NOT the
  fixed one, and I don't know if it was ever released. There is also some
  information available to suggest that it will NOT work on 040 Amigas.

Oxyron (OXY, http://www.oxyron.de)

     (Michael Piepgras, code raytrace, 12/94-12/98).
???> Gandalf (ger? gfx, 12/95), No XS (ger? music, 12/96).

Oxyron came from the C64 with some of that scene's best coders; people like
TTS and Graham made history on the 64. Anyone who's seen an Oxyron demo on
the 64 know what these people are capable of - stuff like Doom routines and
even a good looking, fast zoomrotator! Graham released a 3D engine
(B-Engine V0.1) to aminet (gfx/aga) in june 97, capable of loading Duke
Nukem 3D maps from the PC! Unfortunately it requires an FPU, so I haven't
been able to check it out... He's also the author of the Arc64 utility,
useful for processing C64 files suitable for emulators. And to top it off,
he also worked on a few productions for top german group Artwork. TTS coded
the 3D 'Doom clone' games "Trapped" and "Trapped 2". Other productions by
Oxyron include Mindless (bbs intro), Meeting 95 (aga intro) and Scala 4 (aga
demo, cooperation with Phantasm).
  1994 - The first ever Oxyron demo on the amiga was released in december,
under the title "Killing Time" [12/94].
  1996 - German coder Axis (12/94-12/95) joined Arsenic late 96, but worked
on "Dreizehn" [12/98], suggesting he may have returned to the group in the
mean time?
  1997 - Graham contributed some routines to Artwork's "Exit Planet Dust"
[03/97] demo for The Gathering 97.

  review: Are these people antichristian or what? This demo opens with an
  inverted cross and ends with a pentagram. Anyway, their religious faiths
  aside, this little demo is not half bad. Once it gets going, it opens a
  rather obnoxious border which looks like grey marble, and which stays
  there for the remainder of the demo. Irritating. Anyway, some of the
  effects presented in the little box in the middle is a wormhole effect,
  fire, two spacecut texturemapped cubes over plasma (!), a crystal-mapped
  glass vector cube with mirrormapping, and a voxel landscape that tilts
  left and right...and that's it. We're quickly shown the credits, a few
  brief greetings, and then the aforementioned pentagram. All the effects
  were fast and nice on the 030, with no hint of slowdown anywhere.
    The music is techno, as usual, but a rather unobnoxious incognito tune.
  Not enough mem to run on unexpanded A1200, so it obviously requires some
  fast memory. No release date found anywhere in the demo.

  review: I really like this. There's good routines, good tempo...
  The music is kind of bland, but doesn't really draw down the overall
  effect. Stuff on offer here is, a.o. phong-shaded donuts, mapped vectors,
  space-cut spheres... Very very OK.

· Exorcism (1995, 28.12, AGA ?MB Multifile).
  code: Axis, Graham, TTS, gfx: Gandalf, music: No-XS.
  28th in The Party 5 demo competition.
  review: Exorcism opens with a zoomscroller and follows that with a
  rendered title picture by Gandalf. Not a 'wow' start exactly, especially
  since none of this is set to music. Next is the not-so-cool logo, and then
  the show starts proper, with a lightsource texturemapped sphere spinning
  around the screen to the first bars of the (not so good) techno
  soundtrack... Next is fast, smooth fractal zoomer, and then a blocky but
  wellexecuted voxel landscape. Then phonged, texturemapped torus comes on,
  which is far from the best or fastest I've seen. A voxeltunnel is next,
  which abruptly ends when it commences loading the endpart.
    This is a demo of the Doom clone "Trapped" (done by Oxyron members),
  which looks quite fast and advanced - especially for 1995. Requires some
  fast, don't know how much.

· No Roxy (1995, 28.12, 4k Intro).

  review: Wow! Graham may have expanded his abilities to include the Amiga,
  but he has certainly not lost his ability to impress! This 4k'er opens
  with a nicelooking effect perhaps best described as plasmaflame. This goes
  on for a small while, before we're shown some kind of fractal morpher.
  This is also a good routine, which even has some background graphics.
  Pressing the left mouse button takes us to the endpart, with a text
  plotter over a fractal image of the mandelbrot set.
    The endtext mentions a C64 version...

  review: Here's a novel approach: Some actual innovation! Ofcourse, if

  we would consider. There are some quality coders in this group, and they
  have impressed us massively in the past - on several platforms :D
    I don't really know how to explain to you what effects are on offer
  here, since I'll swear to god there are a couple in here I've never seen
  before! This intro probably wants a machine a little more powerful than
  mine; it moves a little slowly here and there. And that fractal-animation
  stuff is a thing of beauty! No credits appear anywhere in the intro.

  review: This intro prerenders gouraud objects, and then show them to the
  user, one at a time. The way this works is that inbetween each object
  there's a textscreen, and at the bottom of each of these there's a
  percentage counter. Once this reaches 100, you're shown the next object.
  Unfortunately, this is the only routine in the intro.
    The rest of the space is occupied by some excellent audiovisuals,
  including two very good logos by Kurczak. Definitely worthy of download.
