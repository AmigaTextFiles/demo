  code: Sim, gfx: Phreak, music: Accel.


Jetset [old] (1991-1991)
------------------------
The original Jetset was born in march 93 (after Pussy changed their name to
Jetset at the RAF conference), and was one of the biggest Dutch groups in
their prime, but unfortunately died later in the year. They were later
reborn as a Skid Row subgroup, producing their intros and demos.
  Jayce made music for the famous dutch Axis trackmo "Unknown Territory",
and is also in the new Jetset.

Major-Midi joined Energy.
The Swedish division joined Vogue mid 91.


Jetset [new] (1992-1996).
-------------------------
N-L> Apache (sysop 'BLACK BOX' WHQ), Dem, Seck-4 (mainorg gfx, 93), The
     Boss (sysop 'CROSSED BONES'), Vortex (code, ex Scoopex, new early93).
BEL> Maddy (sysop 'METAL IMPACT', ex Fusion).
GER> Nose (gfx, ex Alcatraz, new RAW6, 94), Oli (ex Paradise), Phex (swap,
     ex Alcatraz, old handle Stearo, new RAW6), Sam (music, ex Paradise,
     94), Skull (swap, ex Misery/Noxious, new RAW6, late93).
SWE> Striker (sysop 'FLASHTRADE').
FIN> Gamma (gfx music, ex Sonic, new RAW6).
BAH> Psychlop (trade), Quantum (trade).
???> Coyote (ex Desire, new late92), Jeff, Murdock (ex Cyanide, new mid93).

The new Jetset was reborn late 92, and was a Skid Row subgroup for a while
(from RAW6), doing the usual cracktro duties. They ceased to exist as a
group after the remaining Dutch members - Bullock (gfx), Eros (gfx), Jayce
(music), Red Dwarf (code) and Timeless (music) - fusioned into Royal late96.

German coder Raw Style (ex Alcatraz, new RAW6, 94) left to join Complex
  late 94.
Dutchmen Jay-One (gfx) and Steroid (swap, both ex Freestyle) both left to
  join Axis new.
German swappper Dark (ex Noxious, doublememb Skid Row) left to join TRSI
  (RAW6).
Dutch coder Magician Lord and British musician Hollywood (both ex
   Freestyle, 93) left to join Movement (RAW6).
Dutchmen IKillr (93), Eswat (93) and Timeless joined Paradox. News in
  RAW6, and confirmed in the "Black Box" demo. Timeless was later back in
  Jetset, and was one of the members who later went on to Royal.
Storm (ex Godfather/Spaceballs, new RAW5) joined DCS (RAW6).

· Black Box (ECS Trackmo).
  Code: Magician Lord, Gfx: Seck-4, Eswat, IKillr, Music: Hollywood.
  Review: More of a slideshow than a demo, really, but not without
  entertainment value. The graphics are all in the rather unique Jetset
  style, i.e. graffitti. The music is a sort of old-style house, and it's
  certainly NOT one of Hollywood's strongest tunes. All in all? It does the
  job it was intended to, I suppose, and some of the logos are cool...
  I'd give it 5 out of 10.
    There is absolutely no indication anywhere as to the release date of
  this demo... Anyone?

  Information: Reviewed in Propaganda #4 (mid 94), where it was mentioned
  that the best bits were the music and some plasma routines, but that it
  was overall an average Jetset demo in the usual graffitti style...

Jetspeed joined forces with the cooperation group Triangle, and
participated in the making of a few of their demos.

Lots of the Swedes were in Suburban Base earlier/later... Is Danish coder
Ricky the same guy that coded some late The Silents DK demos?

Swedish graphician and organizer MRK doublejoined Subspace, and later
  surfaced as a member of Sunshine Productions.
Musician Sid (ex Razor 1911 new, 95) left the scene to pursue a
  professional music career. Chorus will continue to compose on his own.

· Chunky Blitter (1996, 10.11, ECS 4k Intro).
  Code: Dalthon, Gfx: none, Music: n/a.
  5th in the Gravity 96 4k intro competition.
  Review: We watch the flashing 'please wait' text for a while, before
  being catapulted into a world of fractal based effects. The intro looks
  quite good, using a sort of smoothing effect that doesn't retract too
  much from the overall impression. The intro also contains quite a lot
  more than I expected it to; it pumped out at least three good effect
  variations after I was convinced the show was over. Then, after it's
  all done, and the coder credit appears, a small tune is played! It's a
  bit of a mystery why Dalthon didn't play the tune during the intro...
  The text file that comes with this is in Polish.

· Definitly Baby (1996, ECS Intro).
  Code: Cloak, Gfx: Probe, MJK, Music: Jazz (THX format).
  Review: I thought I liked this, based on viewing and not least listening
  to the main part for a little while. So I pressed the left mouse button
  to write a favourable review...and quickly found there was a small extra
  part, announcing some BBS numbers. And playing a THX rendition of the
  Bubble Bobble theme. One of my favourite games. Containing one of my
  favourite tunes. Do I need to draw you a picture? NOSTALGIA HEAVEN!
    Some further investigation reveals that this one was probably written
  using AMOS! No wonder it's ECS then... It's their first ever intro.

Juliet & Case (1994-1995)
-------------------------
Two finnish friends started coding demos, and released their first
production, called "CCCP" at the Assembly 94, finishing 5th. A year passed,
and at The Assembly 95 they released "C42", which also came in fifth.
This time, though, some groups stood up and took notice of the coder duo.
They were quickly headhunted to Stellar, but soon after moved on to a more
permanent home in CNCD.

  CCCP (1994, 06.08, Demo).
  code: Juliet & Case, gfx: n/a, music: Groo/CNCD.
  5th in The Assembly 94 demo competition.

· C42 (1995, 12.08, AGA File).
  code: Juliet & Case, gfx: none, music: Groo.
  5th in The Assembly 95 demo competition.
  review: There are no graphics in C42, just 3d worlds and objects.
  There are butterflies, flowers, bees and other stuff from the real
  world emulated. The way this is put together makes it more reminiscent of
  a dark piece of video experimentation than a demo. Original, if nothing
  else. Groo's music is easily forgettable.
    This would be their last demo as independents. Please note that none of
  the effects are fullscreen, but are displayed in a more limited space in
  the centre of the screen.
