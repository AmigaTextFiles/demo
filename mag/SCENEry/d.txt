  review: PF is not a bad demo, just a little blocky and too techno at
  times :) Seriously, there are several good routines here, some of which
  I've never actually seen before - like the waterfall vector. The music is
  slavishly timed to the demo, almost to the extent where it's too much.
  The strength that timing music to the effects gave demos like Sanity's
  "WOC" was largely on the base that they didn't time EVERYTHING to the
  music; but when they did it was always powerful.
    PF opens with a cool raytraced logo, and the first effect is a really
  block gouraud. Fortunately, things do get better as the demo progresses.
  The plasma zoom and the aforementioned waterfall vectors are nice
  effects, not to mention the moving lightsource around the 'bukk' (sorry,
  don't know the English word :D)! Other nice things are the voxel routine
  and the texturemapping. Overall, this is not a bad demo, though it
  suffers from the 'trying too hard' syndrome. Less is sometimes more,
  remember that. It now seems the people that made this have abandoned the
  Amiga for the PC...on the strength of PF, I'd say that is definitely a
  loss for the scene. The two 'additional graphicians' I couldn't see
  mentioned anywhere in the demo...

-------------------------------------------
Damones seem to be based on illegal activities, like cracking. The reason I
have written 'new' at the top is that they suddenly appeared again after so
much time, it is only fair to have a separator to represent the stretch of
time in which they were absent from the scene. I do not know what the
relation is between 'old' and 'new' Damones, but one of their recent ascii
logos read 'since 1991'. The latest release I have seen was date 03/99.

  review: This opens up looking VERY traditional. The first screen contains
  the standard setup of (top to bottom) logo - effect - scroller. The
  effect, this time, is a normal glenz vector. Hardly exciting. I almost
  started believing that was all there was when it suddenly jumped along to
  the next effect: a sinescroller and a filled vector object combined.
  Unfortunately this effect fucked up the display SEVERELY on my machine,
  filling up the screen with green junk. Then it's back to the first screen
  again, only with a new logo and a new effect for the endless end scroller.
  The effect this time around was a glenz with a filled vector cube inside.
  Get the picture? All together now: SEEN IT A MILLION TIMES BEFORE.
  Thank you. Oh, BTW the tune's not half bad. It's one of those synth-
  poppie things I love so much.

Darkage is an Italian based demo group, formed by Modem/Ram Jam in the early
days of 1997. They arranged the 'Spoletium' party in Italy in march 1998.
When Kaosmaster joined, he had the Ram Jam magchart "Showtime" with him.
  1997 - Artwork's "Generation #24" [04/97] announced the group's birth.
Spanish coder DCB joined in august. The group then made it big at The
Italian Gathering in the following month, september, by winning both the
demo and intro competitions with "Vanilla Drug Overdose" [09/97] and "Crash"
[09/97] respectively! Shortly after, Italians EgoLoop (code, 08-09/97) and
Aud (music, 09/97) both left the scene.
  1998 - English editor Kalf (Tony Landord) decided to leave the scene early
in the year, after being heavily criticized in an article in Seenpoint #7.
Ghandy, The Lawnmover Man (TLM) and Mod3m stopped swapping early98.
  2000 - Zito (editor) joined from Apathy, while Norwegian graphician
Bridgeclaw doublejoined from Gods early in the year. Cupid (code) left for
Iris. In december, the official Showtime site (done by Dire) was officially
opened at http://scenet.de/showtime/.
  2001 - Early this year, the entire group was shocked when italian coder,
founder and leader Modem (Paolo D'Urso) finally decided to leave the scene.
After some internal discussion, the rest of the members decided to keep the
group going, and a new main organizer was elected; Ghandy. April came with
the Mekka Symposium party, but the group's sole release this year was the
intro "Welcome To Our World II" in cooperation with Iris. After the party
however, the group was happily reinforced with three talented Germans;
Stingray (code), Scicco (code) and Medi joined from Secretly. Stingray
immediately begun coding a musicdisk for swedish musician Racoon (to feature
graphics by Noogman/Scoopex), but was sidetracked to do the final coding for
Showtime. After a few nights of intense work, he could present the latest
issue, and "Showtime #16" [04/01] was released on the 26th of april, as the
first issue with Zito as main editor.

  review: DVS is not a very good demo, unfortunately, despite some good
  things here and there... Modem coded everything but one single part, which
  is the best one in the entire demo. First of all, Darkage need to get
  better graphicians, since the work in DVS is really inadequate...Just one
  fullscreen pic by DeciBel is any good here. FBY's music is...acceptable.
  I won't go into the other parts, but Washburn's envmap engine -
  represented here by a rock-like object over an animated background, all in
  the unusual color combination yellow/white - is pretty fast and good. And
  the drug promotion part was REALLY unnecessary, guys... If Ecstasy helps
  coding, then why aren't you making better demos?

  Winner of The Italian Gathering 97 64k intro competition!
  review: "Crash" is an unusual intro, actually - in that its main effect is
  a a travel along a road with some roadside scenery... It's a showcase for
  a routine they intend to use in a future game, they say, though we'd
  recommend working a little more on it before releasing, 'cause hey - it's
  pretty ugly in its present state :) Don't mean to be critical, Darkage,
  but the routine looks unattractive in its present state. Perhaps some more
  work on the textures would help... Another problem with "Crash" is that
  it's too short - just the intro sequence and the road, and that's it -
  show over. I find it hard to recommend this intro, unfortunately. Nowhere
  does it mention any RAM requirements.

 Trip 98 Invitation (1997, late, Intro).
  code: Modem, gfx: n/a, music: Corrosion.
  review: Another professionally presented invitation intro, this one opens
  with a euro logo (for some reason) rotated and stretched to the first bars
  of the cool music. Then the text 'WELCOME TO...' is overlaid. It then
  fades down before presenting a TRIP logo - which darkens and then the text
  is overlaid. The text is standard 80 column topaz, no borders or nothing,
  and is exactly the same as in the text invitation.

 Spoletium 98 Invitation Intro (1998, .02, File).
  code: Modem, gfx: Yure/Degeneration, Nork (endlogo), music: Corrosion.
  review: A very basic invitation intro, but presented in a professional
  way, makes this small Darkage prod come out just above average. It opens
  with a Spoletium 98 logo, and then goes onto the invitation text reader
  itself. The text is presented on an animated, swirling background, but it
  doesn't retract from the reading experience. The intro is finished off
  with a Darkage logo by Nork.

  MAG - code: Randy, Modem (improvements), gfx: Orome/Talent (title pic),
        Loop, Made, Pix, music: Maf/Syndrome, editor: Kaosmaster.
  review: The first thing that strikes you about the mag part of
  Showtime #9 is the nice music. It's a sort of sunny, happy reggae beat
  that sets the mood for some nice melodies. You can almost see the
  music video for this tune: the band all relaxed on a beach, drinking
  cool drinks from coconuts :) Orome's title picture is also a nicely
  done piece of art, and sets the mood nicely for the read ahead.
  Contentwise, I'm not so impressed with Showtime, they still have a
  little way to go before they're at the top of the heap. The most
  important thing they might consider is taking a little more time to
  delete some of the articles they're receiving. Right now it looks a
  little too much like they're publishing everything the cat drags in
  the door :) OK, that's harsh and perhaps a little unfair, but the
  focus of the mag could be greatly improved by removing a few of the
  more unnecessary articles.
    Visually, Showtime looks pretty good - in most cases. While I'm a
  little unsatisfied with the graphics for the mag part - especially the
  unreadable icons irritated me a little - there are places where it
  really shines. The graphics for the excellent chart section of
  Showtime were done by Made, and are - as usual for him - of excellent
  quality. Very very nice! The same goes for MRK's (another favorite of
  mine!) graphics for the Gallery section. IMHO they should use that
  instead of the panel graphics for the main mag part they use now.
    I will do things 'a little backwards' here, and review the gallery
  part of Showtime last :) Orome delivers another title picture, before
  we get to the gallery part itself. It reminded me a lot of the
  classic, original gallery - the one in the Crusaders' "EuroCharts".

  review: Well, first impressions always come with the intro, and this time
  it's done by those productive guys from Ephidrena. It's a slightly gloomy
  lil' thing, with the best part of it being the one where shaded pieces of
  paper fall from the top of the screen and the backdrop looks like pages
  from a newspaper, nice.
    But we're here to review a mag not an intro, and I'm rearing to go, so:
  doubleclicking that file we go! =) Impressions of the title picture and
  the first page of text are generally good, though the main font bothers me
  a little... Can't explain why, just don't give me the right vibe =) Anyhow
  this, the 16th issue, is the first with Zito as main editor. Browsing the
  articles first, I find a lot of the interesting things here are of the

  Projects working with 100% Prophets! Diskmags used to tell you the entire
  story in the old days, whereas now they explain the general situation and
  give you a link to paste into your webbrowser... But with the internet
  gaining strength, I guess this is the future, like it or not. I found the
  articles concerning the ShaneTheWolfTheDog (now THERE'S an original
  nickname!) affair highly amusing, and it pleases me to see the Showtime
  staff brave enough to present both sides of the story, even when one
  blatantly opposes Darkage. The main editorial problem with this issue, the
  way I see it, is that it's been so long since the last issue that this one
  has too much material to cover... There are LOTS of party reports and
  results here, for most parties that took place since the last issue, and
  some of these are like 6 months old, but that's not the point. In the old
  days, a mag like ROM would cover a big event like The Party over MANY
  pages - not just a short report and results, but pictures from the event,
  interviews with the winners (and losers), etc. These reports only scratch
  the surface of what could be done =( The 'diary' (news) and 'charts'
  sections are fair, nothing special about them. I see little point in the
  diary section, which could just as well have been a part of the mag.
    The 'Gallery' is a separate file, and opens with a VERY stylish
  "Showtime" title picture by Asarhad/Reason. The gallery is nicely done,
  and was coded completely anew for this issue by Stingray. For the secret
  part he mentions in the scroller, type WADE =)
    The birth of the 16th issue of Showtime was a somewhat troubled one...
  Just before this issue, long-time coder of the mag Modem finally decided
  to leave the scene - which left the mag without a coder! Luckily some
  solace was found in ex-Secretly member Stingray who said he would
  undertake the coding responsibilities. He was sent the ShowTime sources,
  and was immediately taken aback by the fact that it was A MESS! He totally
  recoded the gallery, and fixed what he could on the mag itself. All this
  is explained in an accompanying note, where he also promises to recode the
  entire mag and give it a new outfit for the next issue!

  Winner of the Euskal Amiga Party 2 demo competition!
  review: These guys are probably the first ever group to actually WIN a
  DEMO competition with an average quality 70k intro! There's nothing
  particularly exciting or new about this intro, no outstanding effects,
  graphics or music... The competition must have been AWFUL :) OK, I'm not
  saying this just to put down the intro; as such, it's an OK production
  with quite a lot of effects for only 70k, but isn't excellent in any
  respect. The animations of the dancing woman are stored in the file as an
  IFF animation.

  review: Amazingly boring and uninteresting is this demo. It mixes single
  colored effects with a lot of "State of the Art" inspiration into what is
  a true mess of a production. Avoid.

FIN> Citizen (code, ex Desire, old handle Venture, 10/92), Colonel (Sami
     Leino, swap, ex Zenith, old handle Tonec), Doc.X (code, ex Razkels,
     08/92), Wailer.
???> Cybermonks (music, 06/92), Lloyd (editor, 06/92), Rhino (gfx, 06/92).

Deadline was originally a Norwegian group, which eventually devloped a
Finnish section that became more successful than the main group. The
Norwegian members were coarrangers of one of the earliest editions of The
Gathering. Later the Norwegian part of Deadline merged with main Gathering
organizers Crusaders, and these Norwegian members probably went along:
Freaky Angel (confirmed), Jellyfish (code), Mike (confirmed), Shady
(confirmed), TDK.
  1992 - They cooperated with Crusaders on the invitation for The Gathering
92 [01/92], and coarranged the party with them in april. The finnish section
was born by Mellow-D and Doc.X from Razkels in the spring. Nutcase, Roland
and Visage joined from Eremation. They released several productions before
the end of the year; "1st Intro" [08/92], "Mustro" [09/92], "Notelines"
[fall/92], "Dentro" [10/92] and finally "Xmas Intro" [12/92]. By this time
the Norwegian section had stopped releasing stuff altogether.
  1993 - The finnish division died in the spring of 93. Many members - at
least Dionysus (code, 12/92-), Bad Karma (swap pack music), Nutcase (code
gfx music, 02/92-) and Xendi (gfx swap, 10/92-) - joined Balance between
june and october. Information that Bad Karma joined Atomic seems to be
incorrect. Sysop Roland ('SATISFICTION', ex Eremation) stayed independent
until he closed his board in 95, and graphician Visage (ex Eremation,
08/92-) also decided to stay independent. Both have now returned to the
scene in Mandel Bros in the year2000! This group also features Nutcase.

Finnish coder Lopez left the scene.
Finnish coder Flashburn was kicked.

Boards; LAST RESORT (new 04/92).

Decade were a German-based group formed in september 1991, mainly dealing
in the modem scene, but also releasing the odd crack and demo. The two
organizers are Chris and Jade (collectively known as the Booze Brothers :),
who were in crews like The Company and Valhalla before founding Decade.
Chris joined with a board called 'LOST ISLAND', which is now closed.
  After a while, some of the leading members felt the crew was being let
down by some of the other members, who they didn't want to kick since they
were old friends. The solution was to let the crew die in january 1992,
only to revive it three months later with ELITE only members.
  Spider closed his board 'DREAM PARK' in late 1992 or early 93.
  1992 - January saw the release of the "Decade is Dead" (01/92) intro, in
which they announced that coder and graphician Electron (03/91) left the
scene, Jim Beam and Jonny Walker left for another group, and Milkracer (code

memberlist, like Dizzy and Simply! When they died, their members joined
Black Robes and Parallax. Simply and the Metal went to Parallax, at least.

Raider joined Network.
Finnish musician and swapper Daddy Freddy joined Spirit.
Finnish Stratos and Guru joined Complex.
Finnish board 'TURPENTINE TRIP' joined Parallax.
Frequenz joined Amaze. In Amaze, he was a sysop - whether he had his board
  while in Decept I don't know.

Boards; CYCLONE CENTER (fin).

Decnite is a Finland based demo group formed by ex members of World
Industries. It is most probable that they are exclusively Finnish.
  1993 - Ikon was kicked, and joined Compact mid 93.

  (code, 93) left.
Finnish members DCD (code, new mid 93), TMC (gfx, 02/93), and Visualize

  Scoopex.
Finnish trader Klutz joined Alpha Flight.

 Mass Technology (1993, 09.08, ECS 40k Intro).
  code: Yammu, Slite (vector), gfx: Tucan, music: Dime.
  Released for the Assembly 93 40k intro competition, but was unplaced.
  review: Nice design rather than innovative routines are this intro's
  main asset. The routines are nothing special, and neither are the
  graphics. The sum of the two is greater than the parts, however, and
  therefore this comes out looking not all that bad. Fun music by Dime also
  helps, I guess. Nothing that will stick in my mind, though.

kicked. Siracon and Mellon make music together, as a duo.

Boards; THE M25 (eng, 11/90).

Defjam was born in Sweden towards the end of 1987, by Gehenna, Archmage and
a third guy who quickly left the scene. They quickly became one of the
REALLY big cracker groups in the dawn of the Amiga scene, but then just sort
of fell apart, with no actual leaving occuring. Antiaction never really left
or found a new group; today he is working as a computer game programmer. He
was also the author of Defjam Packer 3.2 (and its forerunners Tetra-Pack,
made while he was in Tetragon) and one of the Amiga's most used apps of all
time, the archiver LhA.
  In their time, Defjam also participated in a number of cooperations.
The earliest was probably with Computerbrains Cracking Service (CCS), but
there has also been coops with Red Sector (late 88) Angels.
  1990 - Around the middle of the year, the German division left to become a
group in their own right, Supreme. It seems Defjam got a new German division
though, since there are German members registered long after that.

Swedish Crayone joined Strange.
Finnish coder Smircher joined Vectra.
Swedish coder T.Phraud/T.Phroud? joined Shining 8.
Swedish sysop Mogwai ('STREETS OF FIRE') joined Agile.

Buntz took with him the board 'SERPENT SOCIETY' from Amaze, but it was
  later closed in Defjam (pre 07/92).
Swedish coder Il Scuro (Ron Birk, new 01/88) left the scene back in 1990.
  He is co-author of the PlaySID system, and he's been living in Boston,
  USA since 04/95.
Eckhead joined Voice.

English swapper Overdose (ex Iris, new PRP4) joined Balance (WHN1).
Most German members; Dascon, Groo & Rufferto (both ex Digital), Powerswap,

Delirium was a true quality cracker group, with famous crackers like Phil
Douglas in the team. Aspect Incorporated is a subgroup. They had some crack

early 97) seen members of Delirium, so is this the old group back or is it
a new group?

Delon is a Hungarian group, which apparently consist of famous Hungarian
sceners under different handles!

 The Final Condom (1994, .07, AGA File).
  Code: David Blitterfield, Power Supply, Gfx: David Blitterfield,
  Rawchild, ADT/Absolute!, Music: Tea-Bozz.
  Review: Nothing here that will set the world on fire, but at least the
  'we all love CRM' part was fun. They do the humor thing to a total over-
  kill this time around, though. The AmiNet description text said 'Delon
  party winner AGA demo'. What party?

 Atmosfear (1995, autumn, AGA File).
  Production: Don Johnson, ...
  Review: I quite like this...these guys have a sense of humor! The effects
  aren't outstanding but I guess they were never meant to be. I'd describe
  this as being in the tradition of Lego's "The Real 40k" intro. First they
  claim to have the first real 4x4 rotzoomer...and I guess they do, if you
  mean 4x4 as in 4 wheel drive... Then they're back with the world's first
  8x8 rotzoomer...which is a rotzoomer within an 8x8 pixel block! See what
  I mean? It's a lot like when Lego claimed to be able to display 40 planes
  on any Amiga :) A plus for the music, which is catchy.

  anywhere in the intro.

Depth was formed in late 1993 by Curt Cool as a Danish demo group, and their
first production was "Cool Tunes #1" [03/94]. During the year |they released
some other small productions, as well as many issues of their pack "Under
the Surface" (01-99).
  1996 - At The Party 6, they gave the scene what they called a "christmas
present", and revived the official "Eurochart", with Cytron as the third
main editor of the prestigious chart through history. This is probably what
most people think of when you say 'Depth'. Bakerman's board was closed for a
while, then reopened late 96.
  1997 - Artwork's "Generation #24" [04/97] reported that swedes Pumper
(trade) and Slurry (sysop, both new 06/96) were kicked, that swedish
Legionary/Weird (code) joined, that danish LPN (gfx raytrace) left the
scene, that norwegian The Paranoid rejoined the scene, and that Sanctum
renamed to Nemo Q.

  review: First of all, let me just mention that this is the first issue of
  the 'new' EuroChart I saw. Right from the start, I loved the new look and
  concept! The screenshots, the information, the graphical statistics...
  This is the way to do things! However, while the concept is great, the
  execution leaves a few things to be desired...some of the information is
  missing crucial bits here and there! Perhaps I need to send Cytron a copy
  of Scenery to avoid mistakes in the future ;) Having said that, I guess I
  put a lot more weight on these things than the average scener would...
  The panel graphics are a little unusual, not to mention that they're very
  very good! Big, clear gadgets leave you in no confusion as to where to
  click. The intro picture by Zack, and the numerous clip arts leave a
  little to be desired, 'tho...
    As far as the editorial content of the EuroChart goes, well... it was
  never intended to be a mag! The best part is also the most important one;
  the charts! The code follows the new norm, in that it is multitasking...
  which is a feature I absolutely love. All mags should multitask! It sure
  makes reviewing them a lot more comfortable for me :) There really is no
  good reason not to download the EuroChart... It doesn't really matter if
  you don't like the cliparts, or you think the interviews in the magpart
  really should be somewhere else... It's the charts that matter, and the
  EuroCharts are the original ones...the real McCoy. Get this because Depth
  put a lot of work down in it, and do a good job.

  code: Quedax, gfx: Raven/Nuance, music: Okeanos/Digital, Curt Cool and
  Marc/Haujobb (Tracker Packer 3 format), editor: Cytron.
  review: Nice graphics by Raven introduce us to this edition of EC. The
  title picture is of a crouching naked woman, but the compositions doesn't
  look all right...Anyway, the rest of the design is clear and concise. As
  mentioned in my review of the last issue, the code is very good. System
  friendly (multitasks), and user friendly at the same time :) The other two
  sections, apart from the charts, are also well laid out this time. The
  gallery is mostly pictures of sceners drinking at parties ;) I did like
  the old Crusaders design for this part better, with two pics a page,
  but... The magpart also has good design, with backgrounds that doesn't
  interfere with the text. Color use is nicely relaxed.

Desire is a demogroup based in the Netherlands, formed by Coyote. After a
couple of years the group was merged with another, of which the leader was
Ramon B5. They also had a strong Finnish section for a while, responsible
for a fair amount of their productions. Ramon B5 was the original leader,
but when he left (93?) another dutchman, Ultimax took over leadership.
Twilight more or less left the scene in 1995, after securing a full time job
making music for Graftgold Software.
  Ramon B5 (08/92), THD (12/91-03/93 and Sacha (12/91-03/93) from the Dutch
section formed the subgroup Facet's Pussy. They later recruited more
members from the mother group, like the germans Chaos! and Kernal. Most of
these members later returned to their original group. Another subgroup was
also later formed, called Love [see separate entry]. There were rumours
early93 that 'SNARF'S PUB' had left, but they were entirely false, as
reported in Freedom Crack #11.
  1992 - T60 left to join the PC scene 09/92.
  1994 - Right before The Party 94, dutch musician Fabian (03/92-) sold his
amiga and left the scene. His promised BIG musicdisk project was cancelled,
and was subsequently never released.

Cone joined Spirit.
Courage (old handle Seat) joined Wizzcat.
Steve, sysop 'MYSTICAL PLACES' joined Alpha Flight.
Norwegian Switchblade (10/92) joined Compact Inc.
Untold, Gorry, Clawboy (08/92) and Undertaker joined Tragedy.
Dutchmen Zorlac (gfx, 05/92-03/93) and Ultimax (code, 05-12/92) both joined
  TRSI (Upstream #8). It is uncertain where this left Desire, since Ultimax
  took over leadership after Ramon B5 left... The two worked on at least
  "Future Inferno" [05/92], "Menace" [08/92], "Thaj Mahal" [12/92],
  "Morpheus" [01/93] and "Vluggertje" [03/93].
Finnish coder Venture joined Deadline. He made "Morpheus" [01/93] and the
  "ChipChop" series [93] for DSR. His latest registered production is from
  11/93, so he probably left late 93.
German musician Pseudolukian (04/92-06/93) got kicked. He made music for
  "Channel X" [04/92], "Thaj Mahal" [12/92] and "Vluggertje" [03/93].
Germans Chaos! (gfx^ascii) and Kernal (code, both ex Analog, new mid93-
  05/94) left to join the Desire subgroup Facet's Pussy.
  They both later returned to Desire.
German Skyfox (ex Dual Crew, new RAW5) joined joined Endless Piracy.
  However, Eurochart #22 claimed he left the scene.
Redferne (ex Awe) joined Devils. Also Remix later ended up in Devils.
Englishmen Bassline (Music, ex Anthrox) and Schizo left the scene.
Dutchmen Cloud 9 (swap) and Solid (gfx, both ex Vicious) joined
  Cryptoburners.
Jack (ex LSD) joined Compact Inc.
Ziggy Stardust (ex Cyberactive), Kyle (ex Starlight) and Dioxion joined
  Vanish, and Ziggy changed his handle to Cujo in the process.
Coyote joined Jetset.
Camelot joined Alpha Flight.
German swapper Stearo (ex Delight) joined Paradise.
Germans Rebel MC (swap, ex The Special Brothers) and Dark (ex Cyberactive)
  joined Noxious, so the German section is disbanded late 92. The following
  people are therefore obviously no more members of the German section:
  Vane, Bootbuster (ex Subzero, 10/92), TNM (ex Subzero), Vain (ex Subzero),
  Kreator (ex Byte Syndicate), Touchstone (code, later Essence), Dascon
  (later Essence), Trasher, Fancy and Powerswap (later Essence).
Iceberg, sysop 'THE HOOD' (ex Cyberactive) joined Spaceballs late 92.
Link joined Gothic.

???> Magius (fin? gfx, 08/96).

Destruction changed the name of the group to Tribute, and multi-function-
man Pacman changed his handle to Speedo. Therefore, Destruction is in
effect dead. I really wish I knew when this happened, 96 or 97?
I do not know if Magius is also a member of the new crew.

 Deep (1996, 18.08, ECS File).
  code/music: Pacman, gfx: Pacman, Magius (logo).
  Released for the Assembly 96 demo competition.
  review: Not outstanding in any way, but adequate. Only two real effects,
  and none of them are showstoppers. Perhaps they should have had a look at
  the winner demo from The Gathering 95 before deciding on the title...
  The only ECS demo released at Assembly 96.

  Labyrinth (Demo).

 No Reality (ECS Trackmo).
  code: TKB, gfx: Swoly, music: Sirrao.
  review: Due to incompatibility reasons, I haven't really been able to see
  all of this demo. What I've seen though, confirms nicely to the old idea
  that textscreen-effect-textscreen is a nice design that works fine :(
  There are, however, some nice effects here, and I'd especially like to
  mention the 'lightsourced fractal landscapes'. Not only do they look
  great, but they render like lightning on the 030! ;) Unfortunately, when
  the demo decides it's time to load the second part it crashes after
  completing the loading. Nothing I've tried remedies this, not even
  kicking the machine down to 1.3. So for now, this is what you get :)
  All credit information was hacked out of the disk itself, since that
  part's obviously in the second portion of the demo. I'd be very very
  grateful for results...

 Plan B BBS Intro (1993?, ECS File).
  code: Jinx, gfx: Jinx, Keops (font), music: Redferne.
  review: This small BBS intro shows Devils are not afraid to go new ways
  in design; it employs a highres display that's original, and made the
  production look 'fresh' when it first appeared. Together with the fast,
  catchy techno music it created a good atmosphere. I say did, because
  unfortunately it hasn't aged all that well. When you look at it
  objectively, you clearly see that there's nothing really advanced about
  the intro, no 'cutting edge' code. It looks OK, sounds catchy, but is
  ultimately not very interesting.

GER> Jon, Poacher.
???> Anzax, Dr.Dolby, Epsilon (music), Mercy, Orbit, Tron.

Dexion are a legendary Danish demo group, who were BIG before Kefrens were
a though in mind. Dexion was Liteace's first group.
  1990 - In december the group arranged the Dexion X-Mas Conference in
Odense, gathering some 600 sceners in what was until then one of the biggest
scene parties ever.

Norwegian graphician Morten joined Spaceballs.
Danish swapper Trix (12/90) joined Rebels old.
Danes Starman and Future Freak (Kim Tolstrup Christensen, music) were
  kicked due to inactivity. Future Freak made LOTS of great tunes, and
  before the Amiga he was active on the C64 as Future Freak/TFA!
Norwegians T-Bone (ex Resolution 101) and Rob (ex Absence) joined
  The Silents.

  Megademo (1989, 11.02, ECS Megademo).
  Winner of the Bamiga Sector 1 and Warfalcons demo competition!

dFX
---
???> Dep (code, later Wrath Designs, 12/95), Elixir (music, later Wrath
     Designs, 12/95).

dFX probably means something - but I have no idea what :)
At the Assembly 96 Wrath Designs released the demo "Gyrate" [08/96] with
code by Dep and music by Elixir...the file also had something called the
'dFX input handler'. It's a fair assumption that we're dealing with the
same people, or what?

퇏#? (1995, 28.12, 40k Intro).
  code: Dep, gfx: none, music: Elixir (The Player 6.1A format).
  28th in The Party 5 40k intro competition.
  review: Short and very blue. That's the best way to describe "#?", a
  40k intro without graphics at all, and just a single phong object (with
  and without animated background) that still manages to be 40k in size!
  They've used Ludde's c2p routine, and the object is in that annoying
  every-other-pixel mask. While the first part has just the object (an
  undetailed torus) and a moving background, the second part has no
  background but 'afterburning' on the object. The file was called
  dFX-Wildcard.exe, a name that's a little more easy to put on the file
  than the actual name of the intro :)

AUT> Edo and Steve (sysops 'PLEASURE DOME', 11/92).

     (swap), Shaddock, Sledgehammer.

???> Bobcat (gfx), Jayhawk, Metal (code), Mr.Mad, Voyager (music).

Dictators were formed by ex-members of Danish group Trilogy and some
Swedish guys. They died toward the end of 1991...though the release date
of "Woozy" and other information make this information seem highly
unreliable!
  1992 - Finns Electro, Phraser, Breeze (music, old handle Megaman, 01/92)
and Simpson (swap) all left to join Equinox 08/92.

Exeron joined 2000 AD.

     LAND (ger), STATIC RAVE ZULU (usa).

Digital was formed after Magnetic Fields was reorganized, and all the best
German and English members formed this new group around the middle of 1991.
These days the 10 remaining members are, unfortunately, mostly inactive.
They will leave beind a handful of good productions, most notably perhaps
the trackmo "Lethal Exit" [12/92], the 40k intro "A Maze In" (07/93) and the
musicdisk "Extemporized" [10/93] - all of which were made by their previous
french members.
  1992 - Spook, coder of the "Punisher" (04/92) trackmo, left the UK to work
in Silicon Valley, USA. German musician S-Sex joins from Action.
  1993 - Evil E was kicked late 93.
  1995 - English musician Sync joined TRSI early.

Finnish sysop Allah joined Parallax, where he's running 'THE CHAMELEON'...
  was the board also in DTL?
Finnish swappers Poke (07/94) and Tint (94) joined Facet's Pussy/Desire.
German coder Chip-Ram (07/94) left to rejoin his old group, Wizzcat late94.
Sniper left to join The Special Brothers.
French musician and swapper Reverse (12/92-10/93) joined Melon Dezign.
The entire French section joined Complex sometime between 10 and 12/93.
  This concerns musician Clawz (ex The Special Brothers, 09/92-10/93), coder
  Gengis (ex Liquid, 12/92-10/93) and graphicians Eloy and Titan (ex
  Anarchy, 07/93), though he MAY have joined Scoopex instead.
Frenchman Vodka (ex TSB) was kicked out, so he rejoined The Special
  Brothers.
The entire Finnish section, John Peel (trade, ex Black Robes), Kevin (gfx
  sysop, ex Magnetic Fields, 09/92), Grim (ex Magnetic Fields), Duncan (ex
  Magnetic Fields) and Hifi (sysop 'LAST GENERATION', ex Grace) joined
  Damones. Later, new Finnish members would join.
French graphician SPH was kicked early 93. The only production I can find
  that he worked on was Gengis' trackmo "Lethal Exit" [12/92].
French swapper and packer Wizz (ex The Silents) was kicked 02/93.
  Redman will take over his packseries 'POST-IT!'.
Rotox left for Anthrox.
German swapper Yoyo joined Fifth Generation 08/92.
English coder Paradroid (ex Razor 1911 old, 04/92) left to make games for
  Core Design. He later joined Anarchy.
Dexter (music, ex Plague, new 04/92), Ford Prefect (sysop), Shrimp (code,
  04/92) and Sync (music, 04/92) were all kicked. Sync rejoined, Shrimp
  later joined Ghost.
Lots of Germans were kicked in early 92; Andy & Ray, Seco, First Revolution
  and the graphics-team Groo and Rufferto (all 04/92). Groo and Rufferto
  therefore joined Delicious Design.
German Flaxx joined Bloodsuckers.

  code: Gengis, gfx: Alex (head), Dougnut (font), music: Clawz (XANN Packer
  format). Released at the Sun'n'Fun Conference 93.
  review: A good little intro from future coder celebrity Gengis, with some
  nice routines. Perhaps the most interesting one being the 'maze' part,
  which resembles an early Doom clone - complete with user interactivity!
  The maze is lightning fast on my machine, by the way. Also, there's a
  nice zoom rotator and an opening vector rendition of a DTL logo. Cool.

  Extemporized (1993, .10, ECS Musicdisk).

  info: This is VERY sought after! If anyone has it, he/she will be richly
  rewarded. Clawz' modules here are Sweltering Forest, Sonic
  City, Extemporized, Spleen and Ideal, Voldsom Kanonslag. This was Gengis
  and Clawz' last production for Digital before leaving for Complex.

 Shakka Lakka (1994, .07, ECS Trackmo).
  Code: Dillenger, Gfx: Gfx-Twins, Music: G.T.O.
  Review: A quite acceptable trackmo from the German division. The graphics
  are rather good throughout, though never excellent. The music is
  functionable, but nothing more, and the coding rather nice. As you can
  see, this demo never rises to greatness, but is still a good production.
    Can't find any party results that list this, and the production does
  not mention any party either. There's a few fullscreen pictures and lots
  of incidental graphics, if that's your thing. Nice. No loading problems.

Digital was reborn in 1996, and was finally closed by Darkus in 1998.
Darkus (doublememb Nuance, old handle Nemes!s) left for Network and Rebels,
and accused Iceball (ex Ibanez) for most of the trouble DTL had suffered,
because of his lying about new members and productions.
  1997 - Ibenz joined from Passion and Skidrow. Alive contributed the title
screen to Nuance's "X-Files #19" [10/97]. Tommy (music), Forge (gfx, old

 Homepage at dc.denet.co.jp.
  I left the Digital Corruption homepage quite unimpressed. The whole thing
  seemed pretty unfinished and rushed. Some parts have promise, like some
  of the graphics, but a lot seems unfinished. I viewed the page with
  Netscape Navigator 3.01, and it seems it's not totally compatible...
  The upper logo, a.o., is cut off etc. Warez-wise there's not a lot to get
  here, just two identical BBS intros (Genetic Waste and First Division)
  and an amIRC script. Will improve, I'm sure.

 L.A.M.E. (1995, 30.08, 64k Intro).
  code/gfx: Sachy, music: "Chipmunks" by Jester/Sanity (4ch MOD format).
  review: For anyone who's seen a lot of demos, "L.A.M.E." is gonna bring a
  smile to your face. Never have so many good demos been made fun of in
  such a respectful, tongue-in-cheek way :) From the opening DINX PROJECT
  logo (which looks a lot like the PYGMY PROJECTS logo from "Extension"
  [08/93]) - to the end graphics before the cartoon (which looks a lot like
  something out of Mack's slideshow "Prism" [92] for Melon) - this is a fun
  ride down demoscene memory lane. The chiptune by Jester has almost
  certainly been ripped from somewhere, but I can't quite remember where...

D-Mob was formed by The Cad and Turbobrain from The Sunriders Swedish
division. They felt they were the only ones doing anything in Sunriders, and
they didn't want to do the job for someone else, so they formed their own
group. Turbobrain is also the author of the wellknown copy program D-Copy.
  1991 - Dreamer joined Vogue, while Raider and Aztec got kicked in the
middle of the year.
  1992 - Daxer left to join Eclipse ca 06/92.

The Finnish division is dead; most of the members joined Intense.

  all left to join Crystal.

퇏Music-Disk 1 (ECS Trackloaded musicdisk).
  code^usic: Turbobrain, gfx: Zak.
  review: This is about as basic as they come. What you get is a scroller
  at the top, a picture of the Batman logo and three (four is you count the
  'bonus' track) LARGE tunes, probably because they were not so much
  composed as sampled. Avoid this and get Music-Disk 3 instead, by much the
  same team...only miles better! By the way, this was D-Mob's very first
  production as a group.
    The scroller is distorted and unreadable on my machine.

Dominators on the amiga was merely a division of the wellknown danish group
on the c64. They were 'active' (mostly swapping) on the amiga probably as
early as 1987, but it would still be a few years before the first
productions were released... :)

Most German and Finnish members left to build Elysion.

Dragons [old] (-1990)
---------------------
It is highly uncertain what the OLD Dragons have in common with the new.
  1990 - French musician Moby (ex Apology) joined Alcatraz (90). All
remaining members (Corsair, Megablast, Mr. Video, Conqueror & Zike!) joined
Angels late 1990. As a consequence, Dragons died. Where did Foxy go?

Boards; JUJU (fin, 09/95).

Dreamdealers is a purely French demo group. In the beginning they were a
small, but quite high quality group. Then Moby and Ra joined, and people
started taking a little more notice. When Moby and Ra left for Sanity they
certainly lost their best assets. Fletch returned to the scene late 95.
  The sysop of 'JUJU' is not a Dreamdealers memb, but Gelfling is a cosys
on the board.

The Frenchmen in Oops! Productions (Alex and Nam, both ex The Silents) both
  joined Movement.
French coder Hexogen (ex Pure Metal Coders, new late92) left the scene.
French painter Trajan (12/93) joined Bomb! (UPS10).

  review: A cracktro whose most important asset is a great Interpol logo by
  Ra, covering most of the screen. Some text is nicely splashed onto the
  screen at the bottom, and the music is...not good. There is no actual
  release date, but it was probably made in 1993 - several things indicate
  this.

  Review: This starts of on a TRULY cool note with a heavy metal module by
  Moby (ahh sweet headbangin'...), before we're treated to a great picture
  of a bull's head by Ra. Then, the bull's head is zoomrotated fullscreen
  while the drums of the tune keep-a-bangin'. ...and that would appear to
  be it. Having experience this power trip (mostly brought on by the
  music), one can't help but think they'd have ended up a lot higher on the
  score board if they'd added another effect or two. Amazing potential!

  review: Certainly nice this short demo from the Frenchies in DRD.
  The graphics remain excellent throughout, and the coding's not bad
  either. As for the music...I thought it was a fucking Moby tune until I
  saw the credits! If that's not a stamp of approval, I don't know what is.
  Very very competent in every department, then.
    Please note that on the 030-50 it ran a little TOO FAST. I didn't get
  half a chance to read any of the text early on, because it just flashed
  onto the screen, and then it proceeded. On the plain A1200 everything was
  fine, though.

Drifters was a french demo group, formed by Golden Hell and Mr. Bluesky. The
group produced more than 30 demos/intros in their time.
  Drifters originally died in 1995 when the two founders left the scene, but
Clary tried to keep the group together a small while more. Golden Hell was
asked to rejoin, and did a few pieces of graphics for them (and Crux) but it
never really came alive.

  sung french vocals. All pretty amusing, I'm sure, but I don't understand
  squat :)

  3rd in the Symposium 96 demo competition.
  review: High points for originality, but that doesn't help this out of
  the mud, I'm afraid. It's pretty much an animation player :) The demo's
  high point is actually the first 10 seconds, when a voice announces
  "Hello and welcome to the Boris disco party", immediately followed by
  Calvin and Hobbes getting down to a disco groove. Cool, you think - so
  how about the demo? There is none. It's just more cartoon figures, set to
  the sound of that soon-becomes-mighty-irritating disco tune. Avoid.
  I find no indication that this needs AGA. It is HD only due to the size,
  but there is no reason why it can't be run from disk if it's packed first.

Boards; POPULOUS (ger, new 03/90).

D-Tect was a demo group based in Germany, probably born around early 1988.
  1990 - November was a busy month, with first the release of "Depeche Code"
followed closely by the second issue of "Hack-Mag". The mag announced that
the group needed more coders, since only Agent and McDeal were coding. It
also announced two new members, Mr.Megaforce in Canada (about to open a
board) and their first modemtrader, Rockford in Germany.
  1992 - December saw the release of the group's last ever production, the
intro "D-Cadence" [12/92] at The Party. It seems reasonable to say the group
died early 1993.

Leo left the scene.
Wire 501 was kicked.
One of D-Tect's greates assets in earlier times and the ex-editor of 'Hack
  Mag', McDeal (11/90-) left to join German supergroup Sanity. However, he
  only participated in one demo for Sanity ("Arte") before leaving the
  scene.
German sysop Rockford aka RCF ('TRADERS HEAVEN', 02-09/91) joined Elevation.
Norwegian sysop Phonebilly ('ELEGANT MACHINERY') joined Dual Crew (RAW1).
Lord Unix was kicked (09/91).
News in I.C.E that Spider joined Coma is untrue (09/91).

  review: McDeal mentioned in a demo newsgroup that this demo was the
  second one to ever feature a dot tunnel on the Amiga, an improvement on
  TIP/TNM's, who was first.

 Hack-Mag issue #2 (1990, 22.11, ECS Multifile Diskmag).
  INT - code: McDeal, gfx: Spider, music: Twisted.
  MAG - code: Agent, gfx: Spider, music: TAR, editors: many.
  review: The second issue of HM opens with a little 'intro' - a title
  picture of a monitor smashing through glass set to music. The mag itself
  is very well presented, perhaps the best design on the scene at the time
  it was released! You have to remember that HM was competing against Crack
  Journal at the time, so they easily had the best code. Like in most old
  mags, too many pages are taken up by unnecessary drivel like humor
  articles and small comic strip pages, but overall the mag represents an
  overall informative read. But party reports without results...booh! =)
  Some critical newsediting would also have been in its place; newsitems
  like that 4-Mat left Anarchy for TRSI, or that Tarkus Team is dead were
  obviously wrong. The mag announces the new members Mr.Megaforce (canada,
  soon sysop) and Rockford (germany trade).
    The first time I tried booting the mag (no caches/OCS), it showed the
  intro just fine but gurued at the first page of the mag. I peeked around
  the disk, and found the way to make it work; boot to your harddisk first.
  Then cd to the disk in question, then cd to the directory 'articles'.
  now type KillAGA (provided KillAGA is in your path ofcourse) to the main
  hackmag executable. The commandline may look like this: 'KillAGA
  df0:HACKMAG2'. Get it? This should make the mag work, though it still has
  some problems with catching keyboard presses - mouse clicking works fine.

  INT - code: Satan, McDeal (fix), gfx: Spider (pic, font), Vinvent/Vision 1
        (bobs), music: Twisted.
  MAG - code: Agent, McDeal, gfx: Spider, music: TAR.
  review: The intro (coded by new member Satan) is much cooler than last
  time. It opens with an ok pic by Spider, of one of the Gremlins clutching
  a D-Tect logo, then goes into the intro itself. Not a terribly inspired
  affair, but features a starfield, bobs, and the obligatory scroller at the
  the bottom of the screen. On to the mag, we experienced exactly the same
  compatibility problems as with the last issue...but this time the solution
  we offered then does NOT work! Disaster! So sometimes even Amiga owners
  need to retort to emulators... :)
    Editorially and graphically not much has changed, the design is
  identical to the last issue. Not many deep articles this time either, but
  it's a good hardcore scene mag. Nothing much more to say really, this is
  an average issue. Support for the mag was picking up, this issue has much
  more outside contributions than before.

  review: This mag from 91 works perfectly fine on my 50mhz 030-machine...
  Astonishing! Well, installing to harddisk wasn't much of a problem
  either, so I booted the thing. The intro is great! Cool cyber-OS design,
  metal-skeleton Terminator picture by Spider and thumping cyber-techno
  soundtrack by Twisted! It certainly sets the mood for some nice
  reading... The mag itself is well-laid out, and there is certainly enough
  to read. There's only one module, again by Twisted, but it's very cool.
  It's got a melody that I simply looooove... This old mag brings back some
  of the 'magic' from lost times. For a nostalgic read, recommended!

Dual Crew was originally a c64 cracking group, and the amiga section was
formed by Stookie in 1988.
  In april of 1993 Dual Crew merged with Shining, and became the new group
Dual Crew Shining (DCS). Among the people who went along to DCS were
Snuskbuske (swe trade sysop 'GURUS DREAM', 04/92), Chromag (ger music, ex

  Color blind graphician Red Devil ran the pack series "Ultimate Sin" for a
while, which was previously run by other DC members.
  1990 - Swedes Omega (music), Tip (music), Mace (code) and Color (gfx) all
joined around july, but the three last ones didn't stay too long and moved
on to join Phenomena in december. Four others swedes also joined in the same
time period; JBM, Trigon, Joker and Hater from Tetragon.

JS joined Byterapers Inc.
English Warlord joined Fairlight.
English sysop Beast ('ARCADIA') joined Quartex.
German sysop Headhunter ('CONDEMNED CELL', ex Aurora) was kicked.
German Wonderboy (ex Awesome, new 09/92) joined Razor 1911.
Pylon C and 7an (music, 04/92) were both kicked. 7an did a tune for the
  musicdisk 'Sound of Science'.
German sysop Xeniator ('SATAN'S PALACE') was kicked, and therefore joined
  Platin (RAW5).
German sysop Fornax ('EUROPE'S HEART', ex 2000 AD, new RAW4) joined TRSI
  (RAW5).
German Skyfox (ex Adept, new RAW4 or ex Agnostic Front, new pre 07/92) was

Matrix, Delbert and Duke joined LSD early 92. However, SLH11 claimed Matrix
  left the scene...
Cooper, Skywalker, Razor and G.T.O. (old handle Magic Duke) left the scene
  to make a game (RAW4). However, this is untrue at least in G.T.O's case;
  he didn't leave the scene. RAW5 confirms he joined Digital!
Germans Tron, Crux, MCM and E.Toball joined Anarchy (RAW4).
  SLH11 mentions that MCM joined Spaceballs and E.Toball joined Complex.
  Indeed they did, but only after their visit in Anarchy (which was
  relatively brief).

  (loader). Released at The Gathering 92.
  Review: This musicdisk is certainly not bad, but could have been better.
  The first thing I'd like to put my finger on is the concept: Zaz mentions
  in the scroller that to avoid a common pitfall, that all the music on a
  musicdisk sounds the same, he has used 8 different composers for this one.
  What he must have forgotten was to check the quality of the modules, not
  just their diversity. I would have preferred to have 5 or 6 of the best
  modules on one disk, and have scrapped the rest. Best tunes: Freedom! and
  Artifical Musique. Red Devil's silver surfer logo is great, but why is
  there no credit for the raytraced Sounds of Science logo? Not bad.
  Another thing Zaz forgot was obviously timing. On my 030, this one jerks
  and flies like there's no tomorrow, and that goes for the tunes as well.
  That can probably be remedied by KillAGA'ing it, though. Easily installed
  to harddisk. Needs 1mb total memory.

Dual Crew Shining (DCS) was born when the two groups Dual Crew and Shining
merged in april of 1993. The fact was announced at The Gathering, held later
that month, through some small intros.
  Red Devil is busy raytracing graphics for games from Softimage these days,
though he hasn't left the scene!
  1993 - After being born in april, the group released their first signs of
life late in the month, at The Gathering, with the two intros "Anvend
Hndkle" and "April Fool". Norwegians Corny and Codeman (also known as CoCo
Arts) and swedish musician Soul (old handle Dexter) all joined Rednex in
december.
  1994 - German coders Zulu & Grey (ex Cryptoburners) left to join the new,
reborn Rebels in 1994. German musician Chromag (12/93-) left to join Lego in
may. He made his first musicdisk, "Chromagic" [93], for DCS. Swedish
musician Azazel left to join The Black Lotus (TBL) between 10 and 12/94,
where he sometime later would become one of the most famous musicians on the
amigascene, largely thanks to his work on TBL demos like "Tint" [04/96].
  1996 - Swedish coder Zero joined Balance late 96.
  1997 - DCS seemed revived with their The Party 97 intro "Blues" [12/97],
which shows good signs for a new lease of life!
  1998 - They reached second place at The Gathering 98 in april with
"Nebula" [04/98], only beaten by their fellow finns in Mellow Chips!
  1999 - In march, a large reorganizing took place, where several inactive
members were kicked and new ones were allowed to join; Relief was kicked,
and so there are no more DCS members in Denmark; finnish trader Zeff was
kicked; Finnish graphician Los joined, and polish swappers Blaze and Evan
were allowed to join.

Phosphyre left the scene.
Smegma and Brainpower was kicked.
Coder Cocoon joined Scoopex.
German coder Cockroach (ex Analog) was kicked.
  He joined new german group Artwork with Voyage (sys) and jMS (gfx) 11/94.
Cyclone and Stranger (swap) got kicked.
Cero left the scene.
Storm (ex Jetset new) joined Essence.
German Plasma (ex Analog) was kicked out, and joined The Silents.
Boba Fett (fin), Double Density, Killroy and Sly (all from Shining) were
  kicked out.
German coder Raw Style joined from Paradise, but only for a brief period
  before moving on to Alcatraz.
Cockroach was kicked.
English musician Dreamfish (Ian Ford, ex Hydlide/Divine, doublememb mono211
  [music]) left the amiga scene to concentrate on the music group mono211
  (where he is now known as DJ Hoffman). Some sources claim he joined TRSI
  early 95...

  Chromagic (1993, ECS Musicdisk).
  code: Heinsen, gfx: Ninja, music: Chromag (6 tunes).
  information: Chromag's first music disk, pretty much made his name.

 AGA Demo (1993, 05.08, AGA File).
  code: Tizzy, Zaz (additional, objects), gfx: Iridon (font), Snuskbuske
  (raytrace), music: Belfagor. 12th in the ECC93 demo competition.
  review: This demo scored 0% of the votes, and frankly I can see why.
  It's a multitasking AGA demo that's unexciting, and doesn't show off the
  new colors much. I can understand how the audience was unenthusiastic.
    The demo starts with a raytraced EDCS picture-logo by Snuskbuske,
  before the main part begins. This consists of a standard scroller at the
  bottom (with a very nice font), a static bitmap 'planet' of some kind on
  the background, over which they show some vector objects. I can see why
  the audience didn't rise to applaud it.
    The demo is also known as 'AGA Multitasing Demo', since that was the
  name given to it by the offical results file :) This name appears nowhere
  in the demo itself, though. The multitasking part is true, by the way,
  which means that this is one of the few productions where you can flip
  the screens with Amiga-M while viewing it. ADL says it's very slow with-
  out fast. Works fine on standard A1200, though.
 GLE tested A1200/030-50/2mb chip, 4mb fast/3.0.

  Sonic Attack (1993, end, Musicdisk, 4 disks).
  code: NZO, gfx: n/a, music: n/a.
  information: Massive musicdisk with music by almost ALL of DCS'
  musicians. Received unfavourable reviews, if memory serves...

퇏Blues (1997, 28.12, AGA 40k Intro).
  code: Shape, gfx: Optic, music: Illusion and Muffler.
  13th in The Party 97 40k intro competition.
  review: A pleasant surprise; not only is DCS back but they've delivered a
  very good intro too! "Blues" leave you with a good, solid impression -
  much thanks to the music, which has a massive, catchy theme. It's an
  impressive tune for this size, and it works well in the context.
  The intro has a 'particle' routine, where 2x2 dots form the words 'DCS!'
  and 'The End' to open and end it, and inbetween there's fast but blocky
  texturemapped objects and scenes. A very good intro that doesn't need to
  be advanced to be fun.
퇏GLE tested A1200/030-50/2mb chip, 16mb fast/3.0.

 Nebula (1998, 13.04, AGA HD 4MB Demo).
  code: Shape, gfx: Adam (gfx, textures, 3d), Shape (3d), Illusion
  (textures), music: Muffler (main, end), Tweek (intro, all The Player 6.1A
  format). 2nd in The Gathering 98 demo competition.
  review: "Nebula" opens amusingly in the style of an old sci-fi series,
  complete with period music. Then the first real effect, a fast but barren
  3d scene with palm trees on tiny spots of earth. From the first bars of
  the music it is evident that this is a typical Muffler-tune. Then one of
  the spots appears to have a flower on it, out of which tiny specs of light
  appear. Then quickly onto a very nicely done bump-tunnel, with intense
  light at the end, before also a trail of small light-spots appears to come
  spinning out from the intense light at each end. And then something
  appears to go wrong, for a long time I only get a totally white screen
  while the music continues to play! After looking at the screen and hoping
  something new would appear for a long time, I eventually rebooted and
  tried running the demo from harddisk (my previous attempt was from RAM).
  The results were even LESS great; it now defaulted to just a black screen
  immediately after the intro sequence! Not one to give up, I rebooted again
  (it doesn't appear to respond to the left mouse button), decrunched the
  main file and tried the demo one last time. And now, amazingly, it worked!
  We get a swirly thing behind the face of a main with sunglasses (you'd
  have to see it :) before another 3d scene with light-spots and a spike
  object. Next something I don't really know how to describe, but which is
  utterly beautiful, over which credits are overlayed. Next we revisited a
  bump-tunnel, only this time we travel through it, while it twists this way
  and that. Soon it also contains a spike-object. Then we're onto a 3d scene
  with another spike-object suspended in the air over water with lilys in it
  - and the object is sometimes reflected in the water. And that's it! An
  upscrolling end message with credits and the like appears (pausable with
  the righ mb). Overall this demo gives a very professional impression, with
  smooth, fast routines that were not just thrown together. The only real
  graphics here are Adam's "Nebula" logo.
    The demo works with just 4MB fast if you unpack the main executable
  first, otherwise requires a little more. Developed on and for 030-50, but
  should work on lesser configurations.
퇏GLE tested A1200/030-50/2mb chip, 16mb fast/3.1.
