Taipan is a Dutch based demo group. Exodus is also the author of the
music utility BP (Brian Postma) SoundMon, and Zzzax the author of most of
the tunes for it!

· Sinerast Intro (1989, ECS Intro).
  code: Exodus, gfx: Artfix (logo), music: "Crystals" by Zzzax (BP SoundMon
  format).
  review: Now here's a novel idea: moving rasters! Ok, ok - I'm a bit too
  harsh here, perhaps, but this is ANOTHER intro from Exodus where I feel
  he's just going through the motions, covering old ground. In addition to
  the aforementioned background rasters, there's a single bitplane logo
  (with more raster color in it) and a simple scroll across the nether
  regions of the screen. So routine it hurts.

· Vector Intro (1991, ECS Intro).
  code: Exodus, gfx: Alf (font), Tankard (vectorlogo), music: "Dark-Angel"
  by Zzzax (BP SoundMon format).
  review: Another typical intro of its time; sidescrolling starfield has a
  spinning vector logo on it, and a scroller at the bottom of the screen.
  Nothing we haven't seen before. Made by Timecircle for Taipan. The release
  date is based on text in memory, no date is given in the intro.
· GLE tested FEL  /000-7 /2mb chip, 0mb fast/3.1.

· Zoom Intro (1991, ECS Intro).
  code^gfx: Exodus, music: "Exclusive" by Zzzax (BP SoundMon format).
  review: This intro receives its name because of its zooming scroller
  across the middle of the screen. There is a Taipan logo on top, and two
  bbs numbers at the bottom, both overlaid on spinning red chessboards.
  This is a pretty ordinary intro, with nothing exceptional to recommend it
  over others. There's a million of these out there. Made by Timecircle for
  Taipan. The release date is based on text in memory, no date is given in
  the intro.
    While the intro graphically worked fine under UAE, the sound was pretty
  fucked up. The music is in SoundMon format, meaning it's chip-based rather
  than using samples, and UAE may have bigger problems emulating this than
  simple samples? Sound and graphics were fine under Fellow.

Talent is a demo group based in Norway, which were born at the Razor 1911
and Imp-666 Amiga Conference (09/91). Their first ever production was
"Neverending Fantasies", released at this party.
  Though they were originally all Norwegian, also minor foreign sections
were eventually granted membership. Djengis Khan's board 'TOWN OF TUNES' was
closed 02/94, likely forever. Brainbug is still working with his old group-
pals in Alcatraz Entertainment Software, doing sound for their games.

Cloudy joined World Industries.
Original Norwegian founders Mr.Z, Necro (code, old handle Necrologic, 08/93)
  and Pensplit (gfx, 08/93, all ex Awe) all joined Banana Dezign (RAW6).
The entire English division - Narc (gfx), Morf, Spud (code), Custodian
  (code), Hampster and Tantalus - left 02/94. Some of them joined Anthrox.

  3rd in the Razor 1911 & Imp-666 Amiga Conference demo competition.
  review: I can't really review this demo, since it doesn't really work on
  my machine. Even with KillAGA, it runs only for a short while before
  crashing. This was the first ever Talent production, as the group was born
  at this party.

· First Little Intro (1991, ECS Intro).
  code: Game Over, gfx: Centrox, music: "bob-bass (centrox)" by Centrox
  (4ch MOD format).
  review: Techs first ever production has a decidedly oldschool flavour to
  it, looking a little too much 1989... There's a giant, sphere-shape Tech
  logo on the background, waving left and right, and on top of this comes a
  sinescroller. None of the graphics are very good, and the music isn't
  really up to much either...

· Amplitude Display (1991, ECS Intro).
  code: Game Over, gfx: n/a, music: "32nd-tech-by-centrox" by Centrox (4ch
  MOD format).
  review: This is a sound demo in the truest sense; just a little something
  thrown together to fit a tune. It features, as the title implies, some
  visual representations of the music, and very little else apart from a
  semi-neat intro sequence.
· GLE tested A1200/030-50/2mb chip, 16mb fast/3.1.

· Blue Velvet Packmenu (1991, ECS Intro).
  code: Game Over, gfx: Thunder, music: Centrox.
  review: This packmenu follows a rather standard formula with a logo, a
  selector and a scroller, though it isn't the worst example of its kind
  I've seen. The music initially sounds pretty catchy, but then fails to
  develop and after a while it sounds like it's just endlessly repeating
  the same 30 second techno riff... A pretty average menu.
    The issue reviewed is #25 (first week of september 91). Tronix is the
  man responsible for compiling them.

     code, 05/95-12/96).
???> Orchis (org trade, new mid97).

3LE is a swedish demo group, founded by two people (one of which was Nude)
in the early nineties. For a while they were just doing AMOS demos and
having fun, and it wasn't until most of the current members met at a local
party in Uddevalla in 1994 that things started to get "serious". Their first
real demo was "Yawpcola" (95). They have since created a name for themselves
creating humorous demos, while retaining technical excellence.
  Graphician Laz (ex Sunshine Productions, new 06/96) got married, had
children and left the scene. Though it is mentioned nowhere, the demo "The
Second Chance" is dedicated to him, as Nude confessed in ROM9.
Ant is a doublemember of Spiderboyz on the C64. When Orchis joined, he
became world organizer.
  Much to my joy, Coma has released the 20 first tunes in his chiptunes
series "Skogens Djur" in a pack to aminet, and I'm commanding you all to
download it! Megahappy chippies with great melodies - just like in the old
days. Ahhhh....

· The Tribe (1996, 25.05, AGA HD Multifile).
  code: Tabasco, Explorer, gfx: Ant, Nude, Tudor/TBL (object), music: Coma.
  Winner of the Icing 96 demo competition!
  review: When you run "The Tribe" from the supplied icon you're presented
  with a nice little intuition GUI, allowing you to select various options.
  This is a very nice idea, and one that I'm quite surprised not more groups
  have adopted! Anyway, you're given options to show some information, show
  a small elk animation (as usual :) and select low/high resolution for the
  demo. You make your selections and press 'start demo'.
    The first thing that comes across your screen, after a couple of
  introductory logos, is a sort of 3D scene with elks dancing around a
  totem pole! This looks way cool, and we're soon on to a phong object with
  'shining' parts, like in CNCD's "Closer" (12/95). Then we're shown a
  (nearly) fullscreen picture by Ant, showing the view out from the inside
  of a cave. This then coincides nicely with the next effect, some bump
  mapping that's made out to look like it's showing a torchlight shining on
  the cave walls, revealing the ancient drawings... Very nice! The last real
  effect is a fullscreen face object in tones of blue which doesn't move,
  but has the colors sort of floating across it. It's a lot like a similar
  effect in Artwork's "The Gate" (04/96), though that looked quite
  superior. The demo then ends with a reprise of the dancing elks part,
  with the credits overlaid over the onscreen action.
    Coma's music (Scoth.elk file :) is functional throughout, and perfectly
  suited to the humorous style of 3LE. The oustanding thing about 3LE, I
  always thought, was the way they were able to combine excellent technical
  demos with a humorous image - not an easy task, as many attempts by other
  groups have shown us. 3LE is unique...perhaps we should be glad there's
  only one of them? There's not any kind of big difference between choosing
  high and low resolution, apart from a dramatic decrease in speed...

· The Tale of Sir Henry - Passengers II (1997, .04, AGA File).
  Production: Spot, Plus8, Coma (music). Released at Icing 97 Beta.
  Review: This is subtitled 'the strip you never forget', and I'm almost
  about to agree. This, you see, is a demo I'd like to nominate for 'most
  unusual demo of 1997'. It's actually more of a cartoon strip than a demo,
  which details the adventures of Henry, who leads a very boring life and
  goes off to find excitement. I won't reveal the entire storyline, as that
  would be ruining the demo. Go check it out yourself instead :)
    There's nothing wrong on the audiovisual side, with some good music to
  accompany the onscreen 'action', and reasonable and clean graphics.
  Now stop readig and go download this. I guarantee you won't believe you
  eyes :)

--------------------
SWE> Spirou (swap, 01/90), The Ninja, Irijon.

Boards; HEIKKI'S NIGHTMARE (swe), ILLUSION (swe).

Top Swap were a mainly Swedish group concentrating on the illegal scene,
under the leadership of Sensei. They previously existed under the names NCC
and Ninjaforce, but it was the same group. When they died, most of their
members (Sensei, Galactus...) formed Adept with members of Public Enemies.


Tornado (-1990)
---------------
Tornado merged with Vision-X to form Doom in 1990.


TPDL (1994-1995)
----------------
TPDL (which means Tom Python Dreamer Lazur) was formed in September 1994 in
Poland. Their first and only production was the 40k intro "Hollywood Mood"
(12/94) which reached the 6th place at The Party 94. Soon after this, the
group started falling apart... First Lazur (gfx) joined TRSI, and was also
soon followed by Dreamer (music). Python (gfx) sold his amiga and bought a
pc, and Tom (code) sadly went inactive... The group can sadly be declared
officially dead around march 1995.

· Hollywood Mood (1994, 28.12, AGA 40k Intro).
  code: Tom, gfx: Lazur, music: Dreamer.
  6th in The Party 4 40k intro competition.
  review: Technically oustanding when it was released, HM still impresses
  today. Correct me if I'm wrong, but is that triceraptor PHONG-shaded!?
  If it is, I truly believe this is the first instance EVER on the Amiga!
  Otherwise, big gouraud-shaded objects with lots of faces are cool as
  hell. Yeah!

Tribute (1997-)
---------------
Tribute was a finnish demo group born when the group Destruction changed its
name to Tribute in 1997. Multi-function-man Speedo (06/97) was previously
Pacman/Destruction. He left the group late 97 to join Haujobb.

· Before (1997, 06.06, AGA 64k Intro).
  Code^Gfx^Music: Speedo. 3rd in the Abduction 97 64k intro competition.
  Review: This is more like it! If this little gem came in third, I'm dying
  to see the two intros that made it before this! There's fast chunky
  bitmap manipulation/zoomers that's most popular here, with some nice and
  speedo routines to help things along (then again, his handle is 'Speedo'
  ;). Amazingly, one person did all this. Recommended for a good little
  intro with fast routines, nice design and nice music.
    Here's a quote from the text file: 'Won't work on "over-accelerated"
  machines with Setpatch activated. So boot without Startup-Sequence or
  atleast without Setpatch.' Still, it ran fine on my machine, started from
  DOpus! Doesn't require a fast processor, but recommends at least 030 with
  some fast RAM.

     Mandm, Nightflash, Onyx, TSC (code gfx swap, 10/89), Twins, Wai Chan.

Boards; AMIGA EAST WHQ (usa), SECTOR 96 (usa), TRILOGY BBS (usa).

Trilogy was one of the bigger early illegal groups, and one of the first
scandinavian ones (denmark) to have an american section. The group died late
1989 as its members (Midnight Maniac, ...) formed the new Elite group
Paradox, which was soon joined by ex-members of M.A.D, Kefrens and Rebels.
Danish member Amiga Freak left instead to rebuild Critters with two Black
Monks members. Swiss members Daniel and Hardrider joined Alcatraz mid 90.

Trinity was formed late 2000 by kfd, and their first release was the self-
titled "Trinity" [11/00] with guest code by Modem/Darkage, released at TRSAC
00.5. One more release was also made before the end of the year, "Cracktro"
[12/00] at Spoletium 3.

  Trinity (2000, 07.11, AGA Dentro).
  code: Modem/Darkage, gfx/music: kfd.
  3rd in the TRSAC 00.5 demo competition.

  code: Lando, gfx: kfd, music: Wavemaker.
  2nd in the Spoletium 3 64k intro competition.

---------------
???> Leffty (music, later TRSI), Nutribrain, Terminator (gfx, later TRSI),
     Transformer, Vince (code), Whiteheat (trade sysop 'BLACK SKYLINE',
     04-11/90), Wizler (trade, 04/90).

Boards; HIGH CRIME (usa, 04/90).

Tristar didn't do much on their own, and it wasn't until they entered into
the longest lasting cooperation in the scene with Red Sector in 1990, that
things started to take off. I have no information on what people Tristar
brought with them into the cooperation...but I would sure like some ;)
At least Flynn (ger 09/89) was brought over.
  Vince coded the packer "Double Action 1.0" for Tristar.
  1990 - German sysop Guru Josh ('TECH', ex Paranoimia, 02/90) joined
Classic. German coders and crackers Beermacht (2 guys) left in 1990, before
the merger with RSI, to be independent.

German Malzam left for Paranoima, then quickly moved on to Vision before
  settling in Angels.
Digital Illusion joined D-Tect.

TRSI was born 29.06 1990, when Tristar and Red Sector Inc decided to join
forces on the Red Sector and The Silents Summer Conference 1990. 1991 came
and went, and 1992 saw the birth of a separate TRSI demo section, called
Masque - responsible for the great WICKED SENSATION demo. However, the
following year saw them tired of being merely the demosection of TRSI, so
they left - taking all the legal members with them! This was certainly a
blow for TRSI, but members like Warhead and TSM helped them back onto the
throne. At The Party 93, most of the Polish section teamed up - with XTD
and Norby at the helm. 1994 saw strong releases like CUBIC DREAM, ARTIFICE
and VIKTORIA. Thanks to Mop's article in ROM4 for background info.
  German musician Virgill joined Complex according to Propaganda #4, but
Virgill later made music for the TRSI demo "Twin Peaks" [12/96]... I believe
the truth is closer to a double membership.
  1990 - German sysop The Seeker ('HOLY TOWER') decided to leave the scene
towards the end of the year for personal problems. German musician Jester
joined from Proton in october, but moved on to Sanity after one month, in
november, without having produced anything for the group.
  1992 - In december swedish musician Emax joined, and immediately
contributed tunes for TRSI cracktros and demos.
  1995 - Three main organizers now, Control, Warhead and Uyanik! German
graphician Navy (ex BASF, 12/93) was kicked early in the year, for unknown
reasons. German musician Blackthorne (93) joined Essence around the middle
of 1995, and his joining was announced in their mag ROM #5 [95]. Nah Kolor
was originally formed in the middle of 1995 by the Polish section of TRSI -
Dreamer (ex Surprise! Productions, 12/94), Norby (new 12/93), Bald Horse,
Lazur (ex TPDL), Elis (code, 94), and QBA - to serve as their demosection,
like Surprise! Productions and Masque had in the past. However, the plans
had not been correctly cleared with the leaders of TRSI, and at The Party 5,
Nah Kolor was given the choice of being real TRSI members or leaving in
favour of this new group. The result was that Norby and Bald Horse decided
to stay in TRSI, and that the rest continued as Nah Kolor. The rest of the
Polish section was dismissed, and these people are no longer official
members; Python (swap, early 95), Reset (swap, early 95), Trash Head (swap,
early 95) and XTD (music, new 12/93). At least Trash Head and XTD joined
Mystic.
  1997 - The Finnish group Mellow Chips joined as a subgroup, to serve as
the TRSI demomachinery.
  1998 - At The Gathering in april, the Mellow Chips pay off - they win the
demo competition with "Rise"!

Dutch graphician and swapper Blunt (Henk Wijnholds, ex Coolio/Ambrosia,
  doublememb Grasshoppers Development, new ROM9) left the scene early 98.
The English section was kicked.
Graphician Scar joined Session (late 96).
German graphician Fiver2 (ex Acrid, old handle Fiver, 12/93-95) joined
  Artwork sometime in 95. He released his slideshow "Honeycomb" (95) under
  the TRSI label.
Finnish coder and sysop JHL ('ZENLANDIA', 04/91-05/94) joined Complex. His
  work for TRSI includes a crackintro.
2Fast left to form Avantgarde in the middle of 08/94.
Tap, Walt (coders) and Dr.D (graphician) were kicked.
Dr.Grell joined Energy (PRP4).
German swapper Dark (ex Jetset new) joined Axis new.
Cracker Saito (hol? aut? 03-08/93) joined Vision Factory.
Kid Frost joined Arise (RAW4).
Swedish sysop Fix ('FASTLINE', 05/92) joined 2000 AD 09/92.
Norwegian graphician Wood joined Andromeda 05/93.
The entire subgroup Surprise! Productions (S!P) left early 92. However
  Flynn, TSM, Warhead, Dreamer and Peachy left S!P and joined up with TRSI.
Daryl (ex Kid Icarus/Alcatraz) joined Delight after a short period, and
  took his wellknown papermag 'B.A.D' with him, late 91.
Vince and Nik got kicked 09/91.
Captain Midnight left late 90.
The Master and TCM (Martin, ger trade, , new 08-11/90) were kicked late 90.
German sysop Mr.Hell ('SUDDEN DEATH') joined Decade.

· Crack Intro (ECS Intro).
  code: Dream Warrior, gfx: Peachy (logo), Domino (font), music: "Simply
  Short" by Emax.
  review: Another small, simple but nice intro from TRSI. Nothing
  outstanding, just a good logo by Peachy down the left hand side of the
  screen, and a text plotter taking up most of the rest. Nicely done.
    The TRSI logo on the left was also used by TRSI's PC section in one of
  their cracktros. Used for their crack of "Theatre of Death" (Psygnosis).
  No date appears anywhere.

· Crack Intro xx (ECS Intro).
  code: Double Trouble, gfx: Terminator, music: Double Trouble (Future
  Composer 1.3 format).
  review: Rather a standard oldskool intro this from TRSI. A good
  oldfashioned 3d starfield (with growing stars) is the background effect
  for the usual textplotter, and in addition the text is periodically
  interrupted (with a 'tv snow' effect) to display Terminator's classic
  Tristar and Red Sector logo - also used in several other classic
  productions! The design suggests this is a younger brother of Double
  Trouble's later cracktro for TRSI. Used for Brainball Playable Preview.

· Crack Intro x1 (1992, ECS Intro).
  code: Dreamer, gfx: Peachy, music: Leffty (Sonic Arranger format, 49856
  bytes).
  review: A pretty standard intro, with a good tune by Leffty, makes this
  an ok package. The intro itself has a TRSI logo on top, and the rest of
  the screen is divided in a 3d glenzvector on the left and a textplotter
  on the right side.
    The intro needs KillAGA to even work properly, but still corrupts the
  screen after exiting. Used for Magic Land Dizzy (Codemasters 18.05/92)
  and Mad TV (Rainbow Arts 19.05-92).

· Crack Intro 02 (1992, late, ECS Intro).
  code^gfx: Double "MC" Trouble, music: "Analyzer" by Emax/TRSI (4ch MOD
  format).
  review: Another classic TRSI cracktro, this minimalistic effort is a
  great nostalgic trip for some of us :) It features a TRSI logo across the
  background, filled with some pseudo-plasma in red and blue. Overlaid on
  this is a white 8x8 pixel textplotter, and a that's pretty much it.
  Short, sweet and to the point.
    The first date this intro is verified on is 10.12.1992, in a version
  that was 100k packed, and with a big module by Emax ("Oberheim Power").
  There was at least one with no music, and one with music by Romeo Knight.
  The most common version is the one with the "Analyzer" module, where the
  intro is about 10k in size. Used for: History Line german (12/92),
  Alianator (music Romeo Knight), Arnie 2 (Zeppelin Games, 93), Global
  Domination (93, no music), KGB Final Sales English (08.03 1993), Elysium
  (25.08 1993) -- all cracked by Saito or uncredited.

  text plotter on the right - pretty standard crackintro fare, then.
  Nothing exceptional. No release date in the intro, but XTD's module is

  review: This is a really nice intro, with a pretty ok logo by Sketch at
  the top of the screen, and the same logo zoomrotated under an 8x8 pixel
  textplotter occupying the rest of the screen. Overall, this intro carries
  a nice atmosphere. There is no release date inside the intro, but the
  logo is dated 93, and the module is date 94.

  review: Realtime raytracing here, which I suppose was remotedly
  revolutionary back when it was originally released. Each new animation
  takes approximately 25seconds to render. The design is classic, with logo
  on top, action in the middle and a scroller at the bottom. Interesting
  more for its historical content.
    Coder Tom introduces himself as 'Tom of TPD' (Tom Python Dreamer). This
  small subgroup would later add one more member - Lazur - to form their own
  group TPDL. That group existed only for a short while and released only
  one production - an intro coded by Tom featuring realtime raytracing! :)
  The intro credits Sketch for the logo, which is signed under his old
  handle Rewired.

  review: A pretty standard intro, I guess, with some really substandard
  graphical work from the later-to-be superstar Uno. His work here is either
  of two rather dreadful logos, one in the middle of the screen and another
  at the very bottom. The rest of the intro is made up of small spinning
  vector cubes going constantly in the same circle, and a textplotter.
  Double Trouble's tune is a rendition of Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger"!

  review: Here's a nice little cracktro, with a rotzoomer background. At the
  top of the screen there's an ok TRSI logo that I'm sure I have seen in one
  of their demos before. Amusingly, it's signed with Rewired's old handle
  ('Sketch 93'), which strengthens my theory that he wasn't around the coder
  to change the signature, and that the graphics therefore probably is an
  old one. Over the rotzoomer is a pretty standard, ok textplotter. There is
  no release date quoted in the intro (from their crack of "Abduction"), but
  the module carries a 1994 copyright, so that's my best guess.

· Sun (1995, AGA Multifile Slideshow, 2 disks).
  code: Iron, gfx: Lazur, music: Dreamer.
  review: Lazur's first slideshow shows a lot of promise, and a handful of
  great pictures. The opening intro is minimalist, but full of polish
  language and comes across as very professional. The tune is perhaps not
  Dreamer's best, a sort-of cover version of an Enya song, with some
  breakbeats overlaid after a while. The slideshow itself runs all the
  way through, just fade-out fade-in fade-out, and after the last picture
  you're presented with a a selector shaped as a TV screen with b&w
  representations of the pictures. Moving the mouse to the top left of
  this display and click will let you exit.
    Ofcourse, the most important aspect of any slideshow is the quality of
  the graphics, and "Sun" does not fail here. There are several excellent
  quality pictures here, though several show off Lazur's biggest
  weaknesses: Anatomy and proportion. His nature and landscape pictures are
  always excellent, but when he draws people he's often in over his head.
  For more information, read Facet's review of this slideshow in R.A.W #8,
  it's quite interesting. Lazur's next slideshow, "Wild" [05/96], was
  released for Anadune. The distribution is prepared for floppy (with great
  icons by Lazur!), but includes an installer script for easy harddisk
  installation. Released by members of the once-subgroup Nah-Kolor.

  Code: The Twins, Gfx: Noogman/Artwork, Music: "Blues of Mortality" by

  Review: "Twin Peaks" is The Twins' Magnum Opus - a true thing of beauty.
  There's innovation and eyecandy enough for an entire 40k intro compo
  here, with some of the best and fastest routines I've seen in ages. Words
  cannot adequately describe how good it feels to see routines that look
  this good, moving at this framerate on my 030-50. Trust me on this one,
  despite the low amount of actual design, this demo looks GREAT! Noogman
  delivers two pictures, one of which is the title picture and another
  fullscreen of a male and female body builder. Let's just conclude that he
  needs to work some more on anatomy.
    Even though all of this greatness is to be found here, I can't help
  thinking that Virgill's lazy, slow blues tune keeps it all downpace.
  I think this demo could have looked a lot more exciting, and scored a lot
  more votes, with a more jumpy track. Overall, though, "Twin Peaks" is a
  demo I'll remember for a while.
    The demo wasn't actually going to get released at all, since the
  version shown at the party and spread later is a BETA version. The coders
  lost all their recent work in a harddisk crash, and was stuck with this
  beta as their only backup. Instead of recoding the entire demo, which
  they naturally were not prepared to do, they opted to release the demo as
  it were. Thank you for that wise decision, Twins.

  review: This is a very nice 30k intro from Triumph, which reminds me a
  little of an intro the swedish cracker group Horizon once used. The
  design is classic, but nicely executed - logo on top, twin sonescrollers
  in the middle of the screen. The scrollers have raster colors inside
  them, and the overall impression is very good. Graphics and music are
  both nice. This intro did some very strange things with the resolution of
  my workbench! :)

  8th in The Party 97 demo competition.
  review: "Mortality" is another one of these 'theme' demos, which try to
  tell a story or send a message through the demo medium. Some of these
  succeed in creating the mood they're after, like Syndrome's "Hardcore"
  [11/96] or Powerline's "Enforcing the Law" [12/97], but unfortunately most
  fail. Tulou's attempt, unfortunately, falls into the latter category.
  It fails to pick up the pace to sustain interest, and the many parts of
  irrelevance bored me stiff.
    So is there nothing good about this demo? Why, sure there is! The
  graphics are sometimes quite good, and it seems like Razorback is a name
  we'll have to keep a close eye on :) The best effect in the demo BTW is
  the 'light at the end of the tunnel' one right after the EKG flatlines...

  review: An asian-flavoured guitar lick opens the original "Pusherman", and
  takes us into Tulou's demo world - a very very weird place to be. There
  are quite a few attempts at doing something different within this
  production, from the music to the charming kung-fu quotes. The effect with
  the multi-layer bumpmapping was very nice. Graphics are overall very
  original, if not especially GOOD... They seem to have been mostly scanned
  and then retouched for the desired effect. Not exactly a showstopping
  demo.

  Review: "A500 Stuff" is not bad, but not terribly exciting either.
  The tune could have been better, but given the 4k limit it's more than
  enough. The code consists of two effects, one being a linevector semi-
  caleidoscope effect in green, and the second being a few badly
  texturemapped, blocky cubes. Nothing here that makes you go wow, but an
  OK place to spend 10 seconds of your life :)
