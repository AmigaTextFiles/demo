The demo competition at The Gathering was abysmal this year, with only the
winning demo of any significance. The german party Black Box Symposium had
three top demos, and The Party at the end of the year didn't disappoint
either. It was the Germans in the fresh new group Artwork that made the
year's best demo in my eyes; "Greenday". Please note that this is a demo I
have never seen all of! It's still good enough, though, inches before the
Sanity swansong "Roots v2.0" and CNCD's "Closer".

cancelled
---------
The Junction party, to be held at Collegium in Linköping, Sweden in June
(16-18) by Razor 1911 (amiga), Virtual Dreams/FLT (amiga) and Triton (pc)
was cancelled. The reason for this is that the people who were to rent out
the party place suddenly decided to add 120.000 SKR to the price of the
rent, and this made one of the sponsors decide to back out. Diesel8/Razor
1911 was one of the organizers, Phase another. The party was originally
'delayed', and the plan was to hold the party, but a year later at the same
time. I have found no indication that the plans were ever carried through.
Read the article in R.A.W #8, and the invitation in Chit-Chat #15 for more
information.

Saturne Party 3 was cancelled several times, before finally being held in
april next year. An Amiga invitation intro was released by Bomb, claiming
it would be held 1-3. september, and text in a c64 diskmag claimed the date
would be 15-17.04.

Wildstock '95 (03-05.11) was cancelled! It was to be held at Almassy teri
Szabadidokozpont in Budapest, Hungary by Absolute! (amiga) and Byteam (pc).
An invitation text was printed in Essence's "ROM #5" (amiga), and an
invitation intro by Absolute! was released for the Amiga.

--------------------------------
VC95 was held in Nyköping, Sweden by Moment 22, Limited Edition and DCS
Graphics. It wasn't a big success; only about 150 people showed up, and
there were no good competitions. It was speculated that with The Gathering
only half a month away, people were probably saving the good stuff for
that... Note: A separate result file switched the two first places of the
Amiga Intro competition, so C-Lous wins...

11-15.04  The Gathering 95 (http://www.crusaders.no).
-----------------------------------------------------
TG95 was held in Stavanger, Norway by Spaceballs (amiga), Scoop (pc) and
SHI. The amount of disasters at TG this year was amazing! For the first
time, The Crusaders were not arranging. When they saw how the new arrangers
were treating 'their' party, I'll bet they weren't too happy with their
decision! The sleeping hall was a freezer, the compos were a shambles,
everyone was locked into the hall while the organizers searched for a
person who had hacked the network... 58 entries were delivered for the 4ch
music competition.
  Complete list with entry names dearly wanted! The results from the file I
got said little about the animation and Wild contests, just that the prize
would be summed and shared between the participants...why? Some entry names
from the other competitions have also been added/corrected.

22-23.04  Black Box Symposium 95.
---------------------------------
BBX95 was held at St.Marien Gemeinde-Centrum in Hamburg, Germany by
Complex, Sanity and Phantasm for the Amiga scene only. 308 people paid to
attend, plus the 15 members of the staff. Lots of Amiga companies donated
stuff for the competitions. Decca/Lego wrote a party report for the German
paper mag Amiga Special! The following year, the party was called just
Symposium 96, and was coarranged with the organizers of the 680xx
Convention and the Fried Bits Convention (atari party). Artwork won the
demo competition then too :)
  21 modules were delivered to the music contest. My results are a little
more complete and correct than the official ones, due to access to most of
the contributions through the Mekka & Symposium 97 CD-ROM.

22-23.04  X 95.
---------------
X95 was held in Utrecht, Holland by SCS-TRC (c64) and Focus (pc). This was
the first time X was arranged, but the organizers claimed in their
invitation text that they were the arrangers of the first Silicon parties.
Another X party followed in 1996. They promised space for around 300 people,
it is uncertain how many showed up.
  For a change, the voting here was handled by a jury rather than the usual
public voting system. There were more demos released than there are on the
result list; entries were preselected. Harlequin/Success PC performed a rap
concert with his group Toadstools. The surprise competition involved drawing
an X95 logo on a piece of paper. Was the promised performance by Jeroen Tel
ever performed?

06-09.07  Odyssey 95.
---------------------
ODY95 was held at Leto-Hallen in Eidsvoll outside Oslo, Norway by Nocturnal
for the amigas and pc scenes. Attendance was purely domestic, no foreigners.
This was the first and only time Odyssey was arranged. The time of
arrangement I have is from a result file; the dates in the invitation are
about one week earlier. Second placers in the wild demo, O.B.B., was
Slummy/Spaceballs (amiga) and Dominei/iNF (pc) doing a striptease with a
psychedelic intro done by Slummy running in the background on the big
screen. Slummy almost talked me into joining in =] O.B.B. was short for
something really amusing, that I can't remember right now...but I think it
was my idea, actually... do you remember Remi? Contraz' winner was just an
amiga animation.

SIH95 was held in Roosendaal, Holland for Amiga and PC. Main organizer was
Dope/Spaceballs, and about 400 people attended. A live concert was

computer fair, PLAY 95 is taking place in the same building simultaneously,
and all ASM attendees will have free access to the fair. Please note that
the website adress is not there anymore; point your browsers instead to
http://www.assembly.org. An official CD-ROM containing all releases was
released after the party... and I want one! :) All competitions had max 15
preselected entries, which means a lot of fine work was released here but is
not in this results list. Thanks to some investigation, and help from
Phoenix/Hornet, we know a little more now than is in the official
resultfiles.

26-27.08  Suspect Party Zone 3.
-------------------------------
SPZ3 was to be held at Ecole Sainte-Anne in Brest, France. This was, the
invitation tells us, the third year in a row this party would be held.
I find it curious that I've never heard of this before? It's a party for
Amiga owners only. All productions entering competitions will have to work
on A1200's with no fast mem. Was this ever held?

29-30.08  Intel Outside 95.
---------------------------
IO95 was held in Warsaw, Poland by Mystic and Union for the amiga scene. 950
paying people attended, making it the biggest Polish party so far! This was
the second time IO was arranged, so some refer to this as the Intel Outside
II party!
  The results presented below are most probably the most complete set of
results ever published anywhere, combining two result files and a lot of
detective work. We try harder! ;)

  it was held in 1994!

09-10.09  Bizarre 95.
---------------------
BIZ95 was held at PartyCentrum Nobelaer in Etten-Leur, Holland for the pc
scene (though some amigas were there too). About 360 people attended, mostly
from Holland. This was the second Bizarre party, following the one from last
year. The partyplace was a large hall, with a nice bigscreen. There was also
a videoroom where new movies were shown, like True Lies, Star Trek:
Generations, Rising Sun, Demolition Man, Lethal Weapon 3, Stargate,
Outbreak, Passenger 57, The Crow and Cliffhanger. A lot of musicians were
unhappy with the music competition jury's selections, and modules from a lot
of respected musicians like The Fox II/Reality were not played. Of the 52
modules submitted, only 20 were played. There were also problems with the
contrasts of the big screen, which was very hard to see because of light
flooding in through the windows of the hall. The organizers tried to cover
the windows, but the covers kept falling down. After the 4k and 64k intro
competitions, the demo competition was moved into the movie hall, which was
a much better solution.

intro and no demo competition. As the results text mention, the intro compo
was also cancelled due to no submissions - from Grotesticle or any one
else ;D Note that Onkel Ballong and Apekatt, winners of the 4ch music
competetion are really Superted and Grimlock/Grotesticle...

RMD95 was held in Solnahallen outside Stockholm, Sweden by Limited Edition,
Dual Crew Shining and Rebels PC. This was the first time Remedy was
arranged, and about 300 people attended on the Amiga, PC and C64. Attendants
were almost exclusively Swedish, except for a few from Denmark and French
coder Ninja/Scoopex :) The prices for the demo competition were calculated
from much higher attendance figures, the result being that there were no
cash prices in the competitions. Instead winners went home with mousemats
and cd's from Lizardking and TRSI Recordz etc.

24-25.12  Movement 95.
----------------------
MOV95 was held at Barnea Community Center in Ashkelon, Israel for the pc
scene. It was the first ever party held in Israel, and naturally also the
first time Movement was arranged. There was no official arranger group,
instead it was arranged by sceners from several Israeli groups. There
community centre where it was arranged had three smaller halls available for
the party. There will also be a cafeteria, basketball and football courts
available. The only results file I've found was totally shitty, with only a
few entries listed. Thanks to Phoenix for helping me out.

27-29.12  The Party 5 (http://www.theparty.dk).
-----------------------------------------------
TP95 was held at Dronning Margrethe Hallen in Fredericia, Denmark by The
Silents. 2744 people attended (full 3 days, about 300 1-day), which is a
little less than previous years.
  The Swedish PC-people in Goto 10 got a one-hour continuance on the
deadline, since their table was the only one in the hall that suffered from
loss of power for a period of time. Some PC demos from good Dutch groups,
like Acme and Logic Design, were disqualified on uncertain reasons.
The FAST intro competition was MIXed with Amiga and PC. The winning PC demo
"Caero" was later released in a 'final' version. Pixie's picture in the
graphics competition was disqualified because it had been previously
released.
  The official results came without the production names, so piecing it all
together took a while :) Also, thanks to the party report in Relax #14 (c64
disk magazine) my 64 results are a whole lot more complete. Multichannel
results greatly improved with the help of DemoNews - including LOTS of
unplaced entires! And the party report in ROM6 helped a lot too... And just
when I thought it couldn't get any more complete, along came Phoenix/Hornet!
=] Thanks Andy! Rest assured that you won't find any TP5 results more
detailed than ours...we hope!
