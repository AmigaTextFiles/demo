The Gang is the group that pissed off the entire Scandinavian demoscene
when their coder The Cracker gave an interview for the papermag
Datormagazin basically claimed he could do anything better than anyone
else...and failed to prove it. The Gang eventually joined forces with the
cooperation group Triangle, and participated in the making of a few of
their demos. They have one more bbs; 'BAD REPUTATION'.

Gate was a finnish based demo group.
  1990 - When Image was formed 06/90, finnish graphician and swapper Der HM
joined them from Vision One. In december most of the finnish and Norwegian
sections joined Anarchy, and Gate died. Wraith was their previous leader,
but joined the pack to Anarchy. These joined: Octoplex (swap), Laiz (swap),
Golem (gfx, 05/90), Griffon (music, 05/90), Psycho (code, 05/90), Wraith
(code, 05/90) and Bruno (music, 05/90).

Norwegians Intec (gfx), Zapotek (swap) and Funky Guru (gfx, all ex Zombie

  Review: Cool! For a megademo from 1990, this is not bad at all. There's
  several stars-to-be appearing here. Bruno became big, Golem did good
  later on... It opens with an 'animation' (3 frames :) of a monk opening
  a Gate, before the text 'Gate Megademo II' is overlayed. The loader part
  is unspectacular, just a Golem picture with a priest and the GMDII text.
  The first part is the BOB-part. 16col animated bobs flying around to a
  cool tune by Griffin. Not a bad opening at all! Great for its time.

  for the Pro-Wiz button like a rabbit for a carrot! Intec later made a lot
  of good graphics for Crusaders, a.o. in the Eurochart.
    This demo was supposed to compete in the demo competition at the No
  Limits & IMP-666 Party (held 10/90) in Norway, as mentioned in the demo.
  Since it did not, it's a fair assumption it was released a little later?

Genesis [old] (1990-)
---------------------
Genesis was an illegal cracker group based in the UK, who were born by
Scott, Action Man and Mr.E from Oracle and N.O.M.A.D and Infiltrator from
Scoopex in september 1990 . They did a few releases in cooperation with
Angels and Defjam.
  I guess when three of their crackers (N.O.M.A.D, Mr.E and I.B.M) and one
important sysop (Scott, 'DULCET TONES') joined Angels (which was one of the
groups they were in cooperation with) late 1990 it was all pretty much over.
Scottish supplier Action Man left to help form Crystal.

English Scooter (ex Oracle?) joined Classic old late 90.
American sysop Allister Friend ('TOTAL RECALL', ex Oracle old) left.

I always found the Giants slogan 'Giants - We Are Huge' to be rather
amusing... News way back in Generation #6 said that all members had joined
Interactive in Germany are probably untrue...except if they all moved to
Germany and joined up :) Hawk and one other coder (real name Fredrik
Schultz) are the authors of the NES emulator A/NES. Some news said that NEO
Norway joined. Any info on who this involves?
  1996 - A 4k intro was their only competition entry at The Party 96, but
they also released the first issue of their chartmag "NightTrain" at this
party.
  1997 - ROM #9 reported that Wizard had stepped down as mainorganizer, and
handed the job over to Hawk. The coder, graphician and musician (04/96-)
joined Digital Corruption later in the year.

  review: A mediocre 4ker, with afterburned red, green and blue large dots

  quickly gets on your nerves... The prevailing feeling from this intro is
  unfortunately 'is that all there is?'.
    The system requirements read 'fastmem', but not how much it requires.
  The aminet package also includes a bonus executable, for 040/060 owners,

  review: Fast, good-looking routines and a heavy metal soundtrack. That's
  what these Swedes are offering, and it's not bad either. The rather
  uninspired soundtrack aside, the main showcase here are the effects.
  Most notable is a morphing/bitmap manipulation routine that's really
  good. Other cool effects are a standard voxel landscape and a plasma
  rot-zoomer. Recommended.

Gods was originally a French demo group, which also eventually got good
divisions in Norway and Germany. The group died around march 1998, as a
result of several very important members leaving. First Sixpack left for
Haujobb, then German swapper, trader, packer and sysop of their WHQ 'LOS
ENDOS', Ghandy (ex Bonzai Brothers, late96-early97), decided to end his
double membership and be in Darkage only. Next Caramel left the group, with
no certain destination, and English trader Lithium (ex Eltech, new late96)
left the scene. After their death was a fact, English graphician Wade (ex
Eltech, new late96) joined Nerve Axis. XBarr has, though it was stated so
elsewhere, not left the scene. He has however, most probably begun working
as a coder on the PC rather than for the Amiga anymore. I believe he is now
in Syndrome on the pc.
  Check out Bridgeclaw's homepage (http://members.xoom.com/bridgeclaw/) for
some amazing pieces of art! Just CHECK out his latest work, seems like
paintbrush - great!!
  1995 - German musician The Loop left for Artwork in december.
  1996 - In april Xanth was kicked out of the French section, and they
announced that Wilsh was never a member since they don't allow doublemembs
anymore. French graphician Geist (06/96) left to be a Balance only member
late in the year. News in Ethic's "X-Files #11" [11/96] that Ghandy and
Sixpack had left for Syndrome were incorrect.
  1997 - Artwork's "Generation #24" [04/97] reported that norwegian Typhoon/
Avalon (gfx) joined.
  1998 - English sysop Zoltrix ('SPACED OUT', new late97) left in february.
  2000 - Norwegian graphician Bridgeclaw doublejoined Darkage early in the
year.
  2001 - In the early part of the year, Norwegian swapper Punisher joined
from Apathy and Darkage.

Norwegian sysop Sealapex ('PITSTOP'/'CLIFFHANGER' WHQ, 11/94-late96) sold
  his Amiga, so he left the scene. 'LOS ENDOS' is the new WHQ, 'DIGITAL
  CANDY' the new EHQ.

  Review: I'm sorry, but I'm rather unimpressed by Gods' mag. What bugs me
  the most actually, is how much POTENTIAL there is here, and how little
  has been made of it. The interviews had so much going for them to be
  interesting, but fail. Just to think what an editor like Mop could have
  done to these articles... This just plain and simple doesn't have the
  'edge' that's required to be great.
    Why on earth it demands a 020 or faster is totally beyond me, since it
  doesn't contain ANYTHING new that mags in 1990 didn't have. We've seen it
  before oh so many times...

  Review: Overall, I didn't find Energy too exciting. Large portions of
  the opening is made up of vectors, which should have been a lot smoother
  with this kind of machine power. Also other effects tend to jerk along a
  little, creating an 'unfinished' feel to the production.
    Highlights definitely include the stairwell at the conclusion of the
  demo, with its bumpmapped walls and envmapped handles :) Other highlights
  were the two excellent pictures by Typhoon and Bridgeclaw, though the
  latter looked like it had some raytracing in there...amazingly enough,
  when you consider the motive! Probably requires some fast.

· Magical Box (1996, 08.02, AGA Intro).
  Code: Kaneda, Gfx: Kaneda, Blunt (title), Music: Kaneda (title), Bliss
  (magical), Wilsh (end).
  Review: Ahh, like a breath of fresh air I welcome Magical Box from GHD!
  With one small, funny, little production they seem to poke their nose at
  everything that's currently hot and cool on the amigascene! Especially
  the system tester was great fun, with its 'post-calculating' after the
  intro was over...! I won't spoil MB for you, just recommend you download
  it...and when it stops doing anything and there's just the box on the
  screen, move your mouse. Be careful not to break it :) Recommended.
    You didn't really expect me to give a bad review to a production
  released on my birthday, did you ;)

  Review: These guys obviously go out of their way to be different. It's
  the first intro I've ever seen that zoom-rotates old expressionist
  paintings, or has a 'Buck Rogers' scroll (it's VERY similar to a Star
  Wars scroll :). Fun, but not terribly good.
