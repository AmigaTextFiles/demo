 |  Do you also think it's very very unfair against other con-       |
 |  ventional artists, if a so called "graphician" is using scan-    |
 |  ned images of any kind, heavy improving graphic toolz like       |
 |  "Photoshop" and other expensive soft or hardware, only to win    |
 |  1st price at gfx competition ?!?...                              |
 |                                                                   |
 |  Do u believe it's far more better to split the gfx-competitions  |
 |  at any Party into "Handdrawn" and "Scandrawn" graphics ?!?...    |
 |                                                                   |
