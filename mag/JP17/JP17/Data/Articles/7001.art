Moodsplateau consists of 19 members, mainly musicians but we also have some graficians, authors, swappers and coders. In the last months we released three albums. Two were made by tripper "Trippers selected works 1 and 2" and the third one was done by elapse, our most active djing member and is called "Weapons of mass-education".
Dodge is making progress in learning assembler and together with doc.k. he finished the bp07 64k-intro called "all City" just in time. At this year's Breakpoint-Party only four mdS-members were present but i am sure we will be more at Evoke in Cologne.
Doc.k. has nearly finished our music-disk-project called "Fuzion" but we still have some serious bugs in there. So he needs some more time to fix it. 
Other plans for the future are: a nice Scenemeeting in Leipzig, a rocking Wilddemo for Evoke, more livemixes and of course a lot of musicreleases.
