                        I am no feeble Christ, not me,
            He hangs in glib delight upon his cross, above my body,
         Christ forgive, FORGIVE? I vomit for you Jesu, shit forgive,
          Down now from your Cross, down now from your papal heights,
                  From that churlish suicide, petulant child,
               Down from those pious heights, royal flagbearer,
      He hangs in crucified delight, nailed to the extent of his vision,
                 His cross, his manhood, violence, guilt, sin,
           He would nail my body upon his cross, suicide visionary,
     Death reveller, rake, rapist, lifefucker, Jesu, earthmover, Christus,
You dug the graves of Auschwitz, the soil of Treblinka is your guilt, your sin
        You carry the standard of our oppression, Enola is your Gaiety,
   The bodies of Hiroshima are your delight, the nails are the only Trinity,
                    Jesus died for his own sins, NOT MINE.
                         Happy Christmas one and all!
