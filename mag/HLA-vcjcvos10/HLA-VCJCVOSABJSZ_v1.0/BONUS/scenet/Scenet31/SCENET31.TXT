FAQ (Frequently asked Questions)

What kind of creation/building/element/organisation is the SCENE?


The Scene, What is it?

For  many people, computers are fascinating machines.  Using their creative
spirit  and  intelligence,  they  try  to use them to create something new.
That  is  nothing special.  It is not only the case with computers but with
every technology.  Each new discovery in science or every new machine finds
devotees  as  soon  as it gains enough popularity.  The term scene does not
necessarily  relate to the demo scene.  It does not even refer the computer
scene in general - there are many scenes.

A  scene  means  all  the people who are involved in a certain area - be it
actively or passively.  Scientists and people who are especially interested
in science can form a scene - even snowboarders or computer freaks can have
their  own  scene.   All scenes are in some respect underground.  This does
not  mean  that they are fully isolated from the outer world.  Nor are they
stricly  organized  communities;  one  cannot tell who exactly belongs to a
scene  and  who  does not.  However, the world outside does not necessarily
have  much  insight into a scene apart from what it releases to the public.
Therefore a scene composed of scientists is just as underground as the demo
scene.   From  this point of view, the demo scene is not unique at all.  It
is one of many different scenish communities all over the world.



Demo-Scene:
Maybe you remember the colorful C64 INTROS which crackers have put in front
of  the  games  to  tell you who brought it to you?  That were the earliest
INTRO-ductions  or better say the first demoscene related productions.  The
hard  thing  for  the  CODERS  (programmers)  today at introcompetitions at
parties is the fact, that the bytelimit of their INTRO is strictly limited.
They have only 40kb or 64kb to use, so the intro of the coder with the best
packer-routine or precalculating routine will win.

To  speak  generally  about  the  demoscene,  it  can  be compared with the
music-scene.   There  are  groups  of  artists  who are all doing different
things, like making computer graphics, either a logo, fonts, entire screens
or  even  animations.   Then there are artists who make computer music.  At
the  demoscene we also have DISKMAGS driven by EDITORS that can be compared
to  newspapers  in  real  life.   Magazines-on-(hard)disk try to inform the
sceners  what`s going on, but they should normally also reach their goal in
entertaining   the  readers.   Also,  some  groups  present  SLIDESHOWS  or
MUSICDISKS showing the skills of their graphcians/musicians in a coded form
to   the   public.   But  most  productions  coming  out  are  still  DEMOS
(demonstrations) which can be compared in some aspects to modern videoclips
shown on music-channels like Mtv or Viva.

And every year the demosceners come together in one of the big parties like
Assembly,  The  Gathering,  Mekka&Symposium or The Party to compete against
each others or just in order to have fun or to booze around a bit.





Cracking Scene:
Members  of  the  cracking  scene  try  to  get  games  or tools as fast as
possible, remove the copy-protection and release it.  Now everybody can use
that  program  for  free  without buying it.  Of course this is illegal and
many  people  dislike  their work because it doesn`t make the gamecompany`s
life  easier.  A lot people from inside and outside the scene said that the
Amiga  market  was  also  mainly  destroyed  by the crackers.  Can`t say if
that`s  true  or  not,  but  it`s a fact that many people gave up producing
Amiga  programs  because  they didn`t get enough income for all their work.
On  the PC market the number of games/tools/utilities coming out is so high
that  all  groups  together  cannot  release everything that is sold.  With
about  300-400  Megabytes  of  stuff beeing spread daily at good PC boards,
nobody is able to have a look at every single file that came out.

Also the number of "normal" users that are willing to buy the software they
use  is  a  lot higher so there are still good chances to earn some dollars
with your PC-software.


Ascii/Ansi Scene:
That  are creative people that design logos out of the aviable ascii-chars.
(of  the keyboard) It`s really ram-hard to make a goodlooking logo...  Most
Ascii/Ansi  Sceners  try  to  introduce their own style.  You won`t get any
applause for a plain copy of someone elses style.








FAQ:
What makes a person to call himself a Scener?

A  Scener  is a person that playes his little own role in the scene.  He or
she  is  in  contact  with  other sceners, he supports scenish productions,
visits  computer  parties  etc.   But  many  people  only  spend their time
watching the demos that came out or hang out in the different IRC channels.
That  won`t  be  a way that will save the scene but it`s also a way to be a
scener.   The  scene doesn`t have rules, it doesn`t have any laws or courts
telling  you  if  you  are  worth to call yourself a scener or not.  It`s a
totally  anarchy.  And that`s what many people enjoy, they can do what they
want without beeing punished for anything.  hehe

However  for  nearly  everybody  in the scene it`s important to have an own
HANDLE, crackers from the past introduced them because it was too dangerous
to  use the real name...  nowadays it would be totally strange to everybody
if  a person that calls himself a scener wouldn`t use a handle.  That`s why
we sorted out the entries in every category after the handle of the scener.






FAQ:
What is SCENET?

It  was  created  as  helpful  tool for the sceners of all kind of computer
platforms.   It  wants  to  give  you the possibility to find your good old
contacts from the past days.  Maybe their email adress has changed and they
didn`t  inform  you,  maybe you`ve been mailtrading with them years ago and
you  don`t have their internet datas or simply maybe you want to search for
the homepage of the group X or the ftp server Y to download the latest demo
productions/cracks etc.  Then SCENET should fullfill your needs!


History:
The first email database was created by I-go/TBL (the RAW-Online chief) and
Cesium  of Session.  Later Lord of Impulse^Crimson Jihad^ex-Absolute!  took
over  their work and released about 20 issues under the label of SCNET.  In
1998  Lord  became quite lazy; after waiting several months for any sign of
him  or  an  update  of  SCNET I (Ghandy) decided to take over his work and
renamed  it  into  SCENET.  In December 1998 Evrimsson of Nuance created an
own  homepage  for  us including the fabulous graphics painted by the Amiga
pixeler  Leunam  of  Network.   Since December `98 we had about 11000 hits,
people  began  to  recognize our homie and started to send us their support
via  homepage  directly.   That  is  what we wanted.  In April 1999 Dire of
Eremation  took  over the homepage and is since that time fully responsible
for  any  kind of links!  Checking & working on all kind of stuff alone was
too much work for one person!

Also  since  Spring  `99  we`re  working  together with the german papermag
AmigaOS.   On their site you`ll find the latest serious Amiga links.  Visit
http://AmigaOS.de and you`ll see...




Since   Summer   `99  we  have  our  own  domain  and  own  email  accounts
(http://scenet.de)  To  be  independant  from any homepages, productions or
groups  became  more  and  more  important for us.  We got many offers from
other  webmasters  to  move  to  their  location  but SCENET was ment as an
independant  production and only with an own domain we can show this in our
opinion  needed  independance.   We`re  still working together closely with
Evrimsson  &  Merlin-M,  the authors of the scenerelated book "Hackerland".
We  hope  to organise a lot more "Cologne Conferences" in the future but at
that  time  we  simply  thought  it  would  be better to follow an own path
instead of keeping SCENET on their site.


In August `99 we`ve started an own ICQ list which is honestly rather small.
Just write us an email to add yourself to the list.  Thanks!






Future:
A  database  like this is never finished, it can`t contain enough adresses.
The  more  scenerelated  emails,  homepages, ftp servers, irc channels, the
better.   Also,  daily  emails & links break down and become invalid.  It`s
impossible  to  check every single email adress every month.  Not to forget
that we would surely disturb the recipients this way.  If we didn`t do that
already..  ;-))


What  we  need is your support.  Writing a small email informing us isn`t a
big deal, but without YOUR help our site will vanish the sooner or later or
will simply become totally uninteresting.

We`re  also searching for more important scenerelated sites like NETWORK or
the  TREBEL  ARCHIVE  working together with us, exchanging informations and
advertising for us with our buttons.  (and we surely for them)
