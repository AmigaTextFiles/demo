DESCRIPTION
New features:
* Recursive rules: right hand sides can be re-translated
* WWW: http://www.comp.vuw.ac.nz/~ffranc/amiga/translator.html
* Still more languages are supported.

Features:
* Replaces Commodore's translator.library
* Provides multi-lingual text-to-speech support
* Works with all OS versions
* Allows language to be specified in the text to be translated
* Totally compatible with existing software.

With versions of the OS before 2.1 Commodore supplied 
text-to-speech software on the Workbench discs. This library 
replaces the Commodore supplied translator library. The origional 
translates text to phonemes for use with the narrator device. It is 
used in software with speech output such as "Say" and "Term". 
Unfortunately for non-American users the origional library 
translates all text as if it were American English. It can not handle 
other languages or dialects.

This library is a drop-in replacement and works with all software 
that currently uses the Commodore speech system.  With this 
version of translator library the user can specify which language 
the translator should use. The following accents are currently 
supported by this library:

Languages supported :
American English
German
Welsh
British English
Icelandic
Italian
Klingon
New Zealand Maori
Polish
Finnish
Swedish

If your language is not represented it is not difficult to write 
translation files for other languages as can be seen by the above 
list. I only wrote a few of these. I hope that users of this system 
will be motivated to create accent description files for the 
language(s) they speak.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
Requires any version of the OS greater than 1.3.  Some features 
are not supported on pre-2.04 systems and systems without the 
locale library. To be of any practical use it requires any version of 
the narrator device and software that talks.

PRICE
Free.
