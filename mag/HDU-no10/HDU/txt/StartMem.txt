==============================================

This program shows the usage of your memory while booting. I 
wrote it, because I couldn't believe that booting takes almost 2 
MByte of (only) 7 MByte of my memory! But unfortunately same of 
my programs which I load everytime while booting, really costs me 
so much memory. With that program 'StartMem' I could modify my 
system to its best form. Also if you have plenty of memory, it could 
be very interesting for you, to know which program takes how 
much memory.

Some features:
- A very good installer/config script. You don't have to write 
anything.
- Should run on all AMIGA's (with Installer from Commodore).
- It starts the needed files itself.
- You can config the datas without run the mainprogram again.
- All is in English and in German.
- The full installation don't need more than 100kByte.
