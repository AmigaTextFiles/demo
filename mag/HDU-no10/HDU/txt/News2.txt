New 3D Game - Enforce

A couple of days ago I brought you news on a stunning looking 3D 
game that is in development, back then I didn't have much 
information.  However, I am now able to bring you further details 
on the game.

Then game will be called 'Enforce', and it is an Action RPG game. 
I have been told that it will use techniques and will have graphic 
perfection of the likes that has never been seen on the Amiga 
before. Unlike most other 3D games that have appeared on the 
Amiga 'Enforce' is not going to be just a shoot everything that 
moves type of game. The RPG elements the game contains 
include such things as your charactors abilities improving as you 
go through the game and the ability to actually buy 
weapons/upgrades instead of just pick them up around the place. 
The game will be based around missions, in each of these 
missions you will have specific tasks to complete - it certainly 
won't be a case of just clearing the level of enemies, finding a lift 
and going onto the next one. It is also worth noting that the game 
will be completly non-linear, meaning that each time you play the 
game you won't have the same missions in the same order as 
previous games. The enviroment in which the game is played in 
will be very interactive, and not dull like many other games of this 
type. The engine which is used in the game is very complicated. It 
boasts some stunning features including: Fully polygon orientated, 
unlimited number of lightsources, dynamic lightsourcing, 
translucent textures & two-layered sky, realistic shading, 3D sound 
and much, much more. The game features support for both AGA 
and graphics cards, which the game playing in either 256 colours 
or 16-bit highcolour for graphic cards. Currently only resolutions of 
320x240 and 640x480 are selectable however, the engine does 
support higher resolutions so this may change.  Hopefully, the 
game will also include Virge support, I'm told that this allows you 
to play using the 640x480 resolution at an amazing speed.  PPC 
support may be included in the future but not just yet.

Hopefully there will be a demo released early next week. This will 
be made available on there webpage as soon as it is ready, I will 
let you know when this happens.

Vulcan Sign-up Caveman Species.

Vulcan Software, the publisher behind such games as Final 
Odyssey and Uropa²have signed up Blackflags' Caveman 
Species.  They will be releasing both anAmiga and PC version of 
the game later in the year. Caveman species is a real-time 
strategy wargame in the mould of such classics as Command & 
Conquer and Dune II.  However, there is one massive difference, 
the game is set in prehistoric times. The game is set in a world 
comprising of 3 continents that enclose over 90 locations. Each of 
these locations have their own unique storyline that creates an 
evolving plot. Unlike many other games of this ilk, Caveman 
Species doesn't just comprise of missions that involves you just 
wiping out the enemy - there will be different goals for each 
mission. There will also be a number of special features including 
being able to get witches on your side and use their magical 
powers against the enemies and visiting stonehenge and invoking 
the powers of the gods. Other features that the game boasts 
includes: 100s of charactor animations, several degress of 
evolution, digitised sound effects, 16bit Stereo CD music and 
300Mb of 3D animations. The game will also include support for 
multi-player games. It will have both modem and internet support 
via TCP/IP that will allow up to 4 players the play the game at 
once. The game requires either an AGA or GFX card eqiped 
Amiga, 68020 CPU, 4Mb RAM, a hard-drive and a CD-ROM drive.  
For the 640x512 screenmode a multisync or VGA montitor is 
recommended. The release date for the game has been set at 
Summer '98.

Lambda Support Site Opened.

An official support site for Lamdba has been opened.Lambda is a 
game which I have featured quite heavily on these pages, if only 
for the reason that it has so much potential and looks absolutely 
excellent. For those few out there that don't know what Lambda is, 
its a 3D space combat game along the lines of Wing Commander 
and X-Wing.  It is a game that looks excellent, and example of how 
it looks can be seen in this and other articles that I have written 
regarding the game. The support site will bring you the latest news 
on Lambda as it happens as well as latest screenshots of the 
game and any demos of the engine as they become available. 
Recent additions to the engine include: background planets, new 
craft designs, collision detection, explosions, flames/smoke trails 
and lots more. Despite what has been said regarding development 
of the game things are moving along nicely.

The new support site can be accessed at :

Incentive to Pre-Order Napalm.

Clickboom have introduced an incentive to pursuade all you users 
out there to buy Napalm, what is that incentive you may be 
asking... Well, its a chance to win a cool $1000 (CDN). Yes, thats 
right. If you place a pre-order on Napalm you will be put into a 
draw to win $1000 (CDN) when the game is released. If the fact 
that Napalm looks absoloutly stunning isn't enough, the chance 
that you may win this should be. The price to pre-order Napalm is 
$70 (CDN), however if you are a registered user of all three of 
Clickbooms other games (Capital Punishment, Myst and Quake) 
then you can pre-order Napalm for half-price, an offer if ever I saw 
one. Obviously, you'll receive all the other benefits of pre-ordering 
such as getting the game before anyone else and knowing that 
you are doing your bit for the Amiga Community.

===============================================
Update - Operation:Counterstrike.

Operation: Counterstrike is yet another Command & Conquer 
clone that is in development for the Amiga. I featured it a while 
back and since then it has improved quite dramatically. Before I 
tell you about the game, something else worth noting is that the 
development team have changed their name and are now called 
'BLUE BLACK Solution'.

You may be thinking that with a host of excellent looking 
Command & Conquer games in development for the Amiga this 
game will have a hard time being successful, however, looking at 
the features that the game boasts and the early screenshots that 
have been released it might just have a chance.

In the game you will be able to choose between 3 different sides, 
the Russia/China Alliance, UniPac and the United States.  Each 
team will have there own individual buildings and units, there will 
be more then 30 buildings and 60 different units per team. The 
game will feature a total of 50 missions so it will be a long time 
before you get bored of it. The game will be a muliple CD release, 
this will allow the authors to include massive intro/outro 
animations, cut scenes after each mission and speech in both 
English and German languages.

I'm sure you'll agree that the graphics already look quite stunning, 
the ones on this page are scaled down screenshots from the 
High-Res version of the game, the lo-res version will not look as 
good as this, however, it will allow owners of 020/030 machines to 
play the game at a respectable speed. The game will also features 
AHI support, TCP/IP support for multiplayer games over the 
Internet and maybe PowerPC support in a later update to the 
game. It supports AGA, and GFX cards (CyberGFX, Picassio 96) 
and will also have a neat level editor which will allow users to 
create their own levels, maps, units & buildings.
The game will require a minumum specification of AGA/GFX card 
Amiga with at least an 030/25mhz, 4Mb Fast RAM and a 4xspeed 
CD-ROM drive. A release date has not yet been decided, 
however, there will hopefully be a demo available soon.

For Immediate Release: Deimos Design Cancels PPC Support

Deimos Design, the team behind Maim & Mangle has decided to 
cancel any and all PPC support in it's forth coming title, Maim & 
Mangle. This was not an easy decision to reach, however, we feel 
this is the only ethical way for us to continue development.This 
decision came as a result of many factors, and we would like to 
take the rest of this announcement to address these points.  For 
the record, we fully believe that any hope the Amiga platform has 
of a future is with open, industry standard hardware, and an 
updated OS. However, we do not believe that this future lays with 
the PowerUp boards. 

Cost Of The PowerUp Investment
An overwhelming factor is cost. The big-boxed PowerUp boards 
(the CS-PPC range, with a 50Mhz 060, a 233Mhz 604e, and no 
RAM) costs just under $2000 CAD after taxes. No other solutions 
exist. For that price, one could buy a complete Pentium II system. 
For the few benefits you get, we cannot justify the cost to 
ourselves 
(try as we might).That is an economic reality that a lot of people 
(including some of us) will no longer ignore.  Hence, not all of us 
will be buying PowerUp cards, now or in the future.  Now, if we will 
not purchase these cards, it is simply hypocritical of us to ask 
fellow Amiga users to do so. We will not do that.

Lifespan of the Hardware
We also believe that the PowerUp boards are a short term 
stepping stone / hold over. There is no guarantee that a future 
AmigaOS will ever support these boards, and therefore, they 
potentially have even less value. Until the OS supports the HW, 
any and all future HW developments are one big bandage.  It does 
nothing to heal the sickness, it only prolongs the suffering.

Which System To Use?
Our first priority upon obtaining the PowerUp hardware was to 
evaluate each SW system for ourselves, by ourselves.  We 
ignored the statements from both sides (as each side is obviously 
biased towards their system) and decided to investigate them 
independently. Suffice to say, that from our own analysis we 
decided that WarpUp was the best solution for Maim & Mangle. It 
clearly won us over on many factors:
*  Documentation
*  Installation and ease of use
*  PPC native graphics support (RTG Master)
*  Stable development system, which worked as documented
*  Shared Libraries *now* - a large part of our shared code

We then decided that since our game would be supporting PPC 
hardware, Phase5 would understand our decision (even if they did 
not like it) as it would only mean more sales for them. We could 
not be further from the truth! Basically, we were expected to 
support PowerUp, no matter what the cost. Our viewpoint was that 
our usage of WarpUp meant:

* It was still support for their fledging hardware
* It would mean more sales for them (regardless of the software   
used)
* Using PowerUp would adversely impact our development 
schedule
* Using PowerUp would effect the PPC support of the title (as less 
code was appropriate for the PPC side under PowerUp (the 
graphics system being a major consideration for this game))
* It would effect the overall quality of the title.

Despite the fact that is was still support for their product, it was not 
good enough.  It was basically all or nothing. We then decided to 
go back and re-evaluate PowerUp, with the potential side effect of 
scraping several months of work. Needless to say, we were not 
pleased.

Ulterior Motives?
As Phase5 are first and foremost an add-on hardware company, 
one has to wonder why they are so forceful about using only the 
PowerUp system. After all, no matter what software is used, it is 
only more sales for them (they are the only provider of Amiga PPC 
hardware). It does not tax their support department, they have 
stated that WarpUP is not a supported system (obviously this job 
falls to H&P).  It does not hamper future developments, WarpUp 
would have to adapt to future hardware developments, not the 
reverse.  What then, is the problem?

In Deimos Designs opinion, it comes down to the fact that 
Phase5's objectives do not coincide with the Amigas future.  
Phase5 have publicly stated that PowerUp is a migration path to a 
"real PPC OS", with the side effect of speeding up the current host 
system (i.e. your Amiga).  This has been stated in public forums 
and on the Phase5 website. It has also been stated that this "real 
PPC OS" is not the proposed Amiga OS 4.0. This can only mean 
that this "real PPC OS" is the planned A\Box OS, not a future 
revision of the Amiga OS.

That is fair enough - they are free to do whatever they please with 
their company and products. However, Deimos Design does not 
consider such plans helpful to the Amigas future and therefore we 
will not support their efforts with our software.

Why Not WarpUp?
At this point, you may ask "Well then, why not use WarpUp?"  That 
is a very valid point, and one which we considered. Deimos 
Design had planned to go ahead with WarpUp until recent 
activities came to light. The final straw came when Phase5 elected 
to put the PowerUp system software in the flash-ROM.  We simply 
disagree with the practice of starting *any* software system from 
third party hardware. The purpose of an expansion card ROM is to 
configure the card for OS usage, not to start up a dedicated OS 
extension. Despite asking Phase5 some valid, open questions, 
they chose to simply ignore us, rather than provide a valid 
technical justification.

You might now say, "Well WarpUp will find a way to disable the 
PowerUp software".Very true, there will always be a way around 
the PowerUp software, eventually.That is the key word, 
"eventually".  Phase5 are free to change the manor in which the 
PowerUp SW is started with each and every update of the 
flash-ROM.This means that WarpUp could conceivably be 
disabled for weeks at a time, with each and every flash-ROM 
update. While WarpUp would eventually circumvent this, it would 
have a very negative effect on any products based on WarpUp. In 
Deimos Design's opinion, this is the desired effect.

Effects On Maim & Mangle and The World Foundry
The main concern is - what are the effects on Maim & Mangle and 
The World Foundry? The first concern is Maim & Mangle.  
Unfortunately, some of the features will obviously have to be 
scaled back, or be removed completely.  As far as the overall 
impact on Maim & Mangle, this is still under evaluation.  When we 
have completed our evaluation, we will announce the results. The 
second part is, how does this effect The World Foundry?  
Unfortunately, TWF is also drastically affected. The World Foundry 
was first and foremost established to create and promote 
utilisation of high end equipment by games.Obviously, Deimos 
Designs decision to cancel PPC support has a fundamental 
conflict with that goal. Therefore, Deimos Design has withdrawn 
from The World Foundry, effective immediately. We would like to 
assure everyone that we still have a strong relationship with our 
former partners, however, we feel it would be unfair to them to 
remain a part of TWF.  To remove any and all doubt, we would like 
to state (on behalf of TWF) that Explorer 2260 PPC is still being 
actively developed.  This announcement does not effect Explorer 
2260, or the remaining members of TWF, only Deimos Design and 
M&M.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the Deimos Design team has currently decided to 
revert to a 68K only development plan. We will not support 
attempts to migrate the remaining market to an alternate platform.  
The market needs to unite instead of bicker, now more than ever.  
If the Amiga ever sees a native PPC OS, we will of course 
consider supporting it with PPC native games.  However, at this 
point we will bow out of the Amiga PPC market. We realise that 
this will not be a popular decision, and that not many people will 
agree with it. That is, of course, your right. No matter how 
unpopular this will make us, we stand by our decision and will not 
support a company that tries to artificially limit the end users 
choices. It is your right to run whatever software you want on 
hardware you have purchased, not a privilege which a company 
can revoke at will. Any questions or comments should be directed 
to Deimos Design, not The World Foundry.  Deimos Designs can
