==============================================
ClickStart And all in this package
==============================================

ClickStart and the other files included in this package can be used 
by anyone who wants to. There should be two directories with 
these files :

BootFiles/
Startup-Sequence
RenamedFile.info
RebootStart

and Devs/
Min-Mountlist

In the root there should be three files:
ClickStart
Clickstart.doc
ClickStart.info

*********
What is it?
*********
ClickStart is an AmigaDOS script that make you choose if you like 
to run the demo or restart your computer. If you have enough 
memory, the demo will be loaded right away. If you have to little 
chip mem, it rebootstarts the demo. 

*********
How to install?
*********
1.Make sure you have these commands on your your AMIGA
SYS:C/
RequestChoice (Included in OS 3.x)
RequestFile
ED
Reset
CPU

SYS:Devs/ or SYS:Storage/Dosdrivers
Pipe Mountlist

SYS:L/
Pipe-handler

(I have not used any third party commands in this script...)

2. Copy ALL files/dirs included in this archive into the "main" 
directory of the demo you want to be Clickstarted.	 
3. When you Start the program for the first time it will ask for a file 
to execute. This could be a script or a executable file. The script 
will find the filetype for you. If you choose a script it will rename 
this script to ReqBootFile and there will be made another script 
with an icon called RenamedFile if you have selected wrong script 
or it seemed to be a datafile. What you do is double click the 
RenamedFile icon and the file will recover to the original.
4. When you have selected the requested file you will be asked 
about the minimum ammount of chip memory that the demo 
requires. If you select the "Other" button the program ED will 
popup on your screen. Then you just type in the amount of 
memory in BYTES and push "Esc" and "x" button. 

If you use the script, and likes/dislikes it, feel free to write to me 
and tell me what you think of it. Is it good or is it not worth the work 
you had to unarchive it ? Comments, Suggestions, Threatnings 
and other nice things should be sent to the following adress :
