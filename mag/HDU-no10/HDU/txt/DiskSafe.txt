==============================================
Keeps disks valid from accidential resets by catching the reset 
signal and writing the bitmap information first. Read the guide first,

New in this version:
- I added another safety check for the device node scanning on 
startup, so   DiskSafe will now detect non-filing devices safely.
- Fixed a possible bug in the startup code.
- Added a possible enforcer hit of the ResetList program. Included 
the new binary and the updated source.
- Included a new swedish (svenska) translation of the guide. 
Thanks again to Johan "S.Duvan" Alfredsson and Henrik "Puh" 
Nilsson.
