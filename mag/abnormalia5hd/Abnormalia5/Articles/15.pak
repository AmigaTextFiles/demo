Struggling.   Like  a  swimmer  who  has  stayed  underwater  too long, suddenly
realizing  the immense distance to the surface.  Striving to reach the air.  The
thought enters my mind.  Breathe.  I manage to turn my consciousness on.  I fill
my  lungs.   I  am  awake.   Gasping.  I have survived another trip to uncharted
territories.  Once again I have survived.  Once again that uncomfortable feeling
linger  in  my limbs.  I do not know if I am still dreaming.  I do not know if I
have just begun dreaming after a long period of awakeness.

Countless  times  have  awoke from dreams I in the dream knew to be no more than
vivid  imaginations.  Countless times have I acted upon the conceived reality of
my  surroundings,  as  now.   I  have  elaborate memories of experiences in this
world, they feel less real than my dreams.

Sometimes  I  remember things I believe never to have happened.  I believe it to
be  a  dream.  An unreal image from labyrinths roamed by electrons.  Checking my
sensory impulses I find my assumption to be apparently correct.

I question the reality around me.  Still I fear pain.

The brother of a king leads a rebellion.  The king's army defeats the rebels.
The  leader  of  the  rebellion is brought forth for the king.  A traveller from
distant lands is shocked as the king is ordering his own brother's execution.
The  king  sees  this.   He  orders  the  execution  to be delayed.  He asks the
traveller:   "What we experience here and now may very well be a dream; I may be
a  traveller  and  you  a king.  Traveller, what would you do if so were it?" "I
would  show  mercy  for  my brother, Your highness," the traveller answers.  The
king  sighs.   "Then  this  is  not  a  dream and you are not the king.  Our law
demands death for my brother's treason and I can not change the law only because
it  is  my  brother  who  acted against it." "But, Your highness," the traveller
objects; "If this is a dream how could you know You are acting rightly now?" The
king  answers:  "All individuals must act according to what they think should be
done,  and  assuming  that  everything is illusions is not an acceptable risk to
take.   If  everything  is  intangible  shadows,  one's  actions do not make any
difference,  if  our  surroundings  are what we perceive as real, doing what one
thinks serves ones goals better becomes one of the more obvious conclusions.
When  proofs  of  which  of  the  possibilities  is  right are missing, one must
therefore  act  as  if  the  world  is  real.  Can you prove this to be a dream,
traveller?"  The  traveller  stays  silent.   The  king  nods  to  a guard.  The
execution of the king's brother is carried out.

The  king  has given me an answer, but not peace.  I will return to bed with the
same  fear.   The  same  doubt.   The  same hope.  "But revelation?  That is the
province of dream." (Neil Gaiman)
