It's  rather  difficult  to  define  what you will find written in this space; a
breath of air stolen from a lung we call Abnormalia.

It'll  be something scene-related or something that considers our dimension just
any  of the divisions, within an act, during which there is no change of time or
place,  to  define  it  as  Shakespeare  would  have done?  Some of you are just
wondering about this question, I would bet.

Well,  as  it  is planned to be, this corner inserted in Abnormalia will be very
close to the scene and very far from it at the very same time.

Just  think  I  had  the ispiration while I was reading the last three issues of
Zine,  the magazine about which it seems it has been written everything and more
than  everything,  but which it's still a landmark, a milestone for every scener
and  particularly for editors.  I could also say that a sort of headline of this
section  has  been already published in an issue of The Charts, I can't remember
which  one,  but  looking  at it by the wiseness of the past I would dare to say
that those "Monthly toughts" could suit very well the role I mentioned before.

The  "Patsy Affair" was a brilliant trick to start a life'n'love corner which, I
think,  had  not  the opportunity to take off because of the premature burial of
the whole magazine.  Also if it did not show revolutionary stuff nor a clear and
clever  design  it  can  be  considered a dawn, just a single dawn in a magazine
which  was  preparing herself for the twilight.  To tell the truth some articles
published  in  the  old  Zine could be defined at least average because of their
shortness, but if you think that more than two years have passed they are really
worth of reading.

So  here  I  would try to continue a speech, a dialogue, a forum which has shown
hidden qualities and has had the disgrace of borning already dead, but, I'm sure
of  this, will find new life, like new blood in veins, and will grow every issue
bigger and bigger.

I  can't  promise  any  Patsy  here,  but  I  believe  Patsy's times are over as
nowadays' sceners are clever enough to be not cheated by anoyone, anymore.
