3Introduction
The  Amphotericin B is a polyene antibiotic commonly used in clinical treatments
of  systemic  fungal infections.  Isolated from a strain of Streptomyces nodosus
in  1956,  it  has  been  largely  studied  for years since its wide spectrum of
activity  against  yeasts (Candida Albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans), dimorphic
fungi   (Histoplasma   capsulatum,   Coccidioides  immitis),  filamentous  fungi
(Aspergillus)  and  even some protozoa (Leishmania and Naegleria) is accompanied
by  severe  secondary  effects (anaphylaxis, thrombocytopenia, flushing, general
pain,  convulsions,  chills,  fever,  phlebitis,  headache, anemia, anorexia and
decreased  renal  function) (Gallis et al., 1990, for review).  The research for
AmB  derivatives  and delivery systems with less toxicity for host cells gains a
particular   importance   in   relation   to   the   increasing   diffusion   of
immunodepression  cases, due to anti-cancer chemotherapies, corticotherapies and
AIDS.
The  most  evident  effect  of  AmB is the modification of the cellular membrane
permeability  which  cause an alteration of the cell's ionic equilibrium and the
relative osmotic unbalance.
The  mechanism of action of the molecule, anyway, is quite complex and still not
perfectly  understood;  a  better  comprehension  of  its  dynamics  may lead to
improved theraupetic results.

3Chemical and physical properties.
The Amphotericin B belongs to the family of macrolide polienic antibiotics, it's
structure  was  completely  elucidated  by  Mechlinski  et coll.  in 1970.  It's
formed  by  a 37 Carbonium atoms lactone ring with two sides featuring different
chemical properties.
The  first  one is a nonpolar conjugated eptaene (seven conjugated double bounds
in  trans  conformation),  which  gives  to the molecule a rigid structure and a
strong  absorbtion  spectrum useful for spectroscopic studies, the second one is
polar, having various hydroxyl groups, a keto and a mycosamine ring.
The molecule therefore has a amphiphilic nature and it's poorly soluble in water
for the presence of the hydrophobic region and for its zwitterionic character.
The  presence  of  a COOH and a NH2 group gives it the characteristic amphoteric
property.
AmB   is   a   yellow   powder,  soluble  in  strongly  polar  organic  solvents
(dimethylsulfoxide  (DMSO),  methanol),  it is commercially available, under the
name  of  Fungizone (R), associated with desoxycholate of sodium which permits a
better solubility in water.
In  aqueous  solution  AmB  exists  in  three  mixed  forms:   monomers, soluble
auto-associated  oligomers and insoluble aggregates of oligomers (Vertut-Croquin
et  al.,  1983).   At  low  concentrations  (below 5.10-8 M) it is found only in
monomeric  form,  at  higher  concentrations (between 5.10-8 M and 10-6 M) there
appear also auto-associated soluble oligomers.
The  presence  of  insoluble aggregates at concentrations higher than 10-6 M may
have significant theraupetic influences whose importance is under investigation.
AmB  in water is unstable at light, oxygen, strong temperatures and extreme pHs.
Being  a  polyunsatured  molecule  it tends to autoxidize in the presence of air
forming  free radicals ad other active chemical species and losing its efficency
(Lamy-Freund et al., 1984).

3Biological properties
The effects of Amphotericin B on fungal or animal cells are various.  It affects
the  membrane  permeability  for  monovalent and in bivalent cations (Hartsel et
al.,  1993,  for  review),  it  inhibits the action of membrane enzimes like the
proton  ATPase in Candida Albicans (Solov'eva et al.  1976) or the Na+/K+ ATPase
in  red blood cells and it peroxides the insature lipids (Sokol-Anderson et al.,
1986).
The  membrane  permeabilization,  obtained with a process thought to involve the
formation  of transmembrane pores, takes place generally at lower concentrations
and  at faster rates.  The first noticeable effect of the antibiotic incubation,
in  fact,  is the promotion of a ionic unbalance inside the cell, especially for
the monovalent ions Na+ and K+.
AmB   has  a  much  higher  affinity  for  ergosterol  (they  bind  with  a  1:1
stechiometry)  than for cholesterol.  This explains the selectivity of the drug,
considered that animal cells membranes lack ergosterol, which is instead present
in fungal plasmalemma.
The  permeabilization  in  animal  membranes  takes place only at concentrations
where  AmB is found in soluble auto-associated oligomers, this suggests that the
formation  of  pores  in  ergosterol-lacking  membranes  may  follow a different
process.
In fungal cells AmB molecules may associate with ergosterol and form pores whose
structure  and  dimensions have alse been described with various models (Hartsel
et  al.,  1993;  Bolard et al., 1991).  In mammal cells AmB may form a different
kind  of  pores,  composed  only  by AmB molecules and possible only at high AmB
concentrations.
AmB  molecules  tend  to  autoxydate,  the  relative products (hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2), singlet oxygen (1O2), hydroxyl radical (OH.) and anion superoxide (O2-))
induce  a peroxydation of the lipidic bilayer which can more easily be destroyed
by the osmotic unbalance caused by the earlier membrane permeabilization.
The  inhibition  of  certain  membrane  enzymes  seems not to be due to a direct
action of the molecule but to its modifications of the membrane structure.
Generally  the  cases  of  drug  resistance in fungal cells are not a teraupetic
problem.  They tend to occur relatively rarely and, furthermore, resistant cells
are  usually  weaker  and  less pathogen since the modifications in the membrane
(typically  manifested  as  lack of ergosterol), which permits resistance to the
drug, are quite radical and often compromise the same cell's pathogeny.

Current researches are addressed towards the following directions:
- study  of  sinergic  effects  of  AmB  and  other antifungals.  AmB's membrane
  permeabilization may facilitate the uptake of other agents (Brajtburg, 1992);
- discovery of AmB derivatives with better selectivity and less side effects;
- definition of new vectors which may increase the dose of AmB delivered without
  raising  its  toxicity  for  the  host  organism.   The  formulation  of micro
  liposomial  spheres (liposomes) containing the AmB to deliver is presently the
  most studied and promising possibility;
- creation of AmB derivatives with feeble tendence to auto-association which may
  decrease the drug toxicity;
- influence  of  low doses of  AmB on cells of the immune system.  It seems that
  AmB  enhance  tumoricidal  and microbicidal actions of macrophages (Chapman et
  al, 1978; Bistoni et al, 1985) and monocytes (Martin et al, 1994).
