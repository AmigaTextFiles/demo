3                     FIENDS FOR FOOLISH FRIENDS (F.F.F.F.)

                            a new Fiendship Movement
                         introduced by2 RokDaZone/INFECT


With bewilderness, we chaps here at the MARVELLOUS(!) LUNATICS BALL-embassy have
come  to  understand  that  there  is  a  new  friendship-movement called F.F.F.
Aaaargh!   We  just  slaughtered the idiocy from 1992 or such, when REBELS (plus
some  other  fuzzies) thought to raise friendship (and their own name of course)
by  their  friendship movement...  Nonsense!  Why should I be the friend of a 13
year  old Finish swapper, eh?  I even don't know him and if you ask me - I ain't
interested  in  getting to know him...  By the way, did you know REBELS died the
very same year?

Has  it  something  to do with that ridiculous "reunion" of the infamous REBELS?
Seems like.

Anyway,  we  hereby  proudly  announce  the  birth  of  the  FIENDS  FOR FOOLISH
FRIENDS-Movement  (which has nothing to do with the pseudo-fun-group of the same
name  (We  mean  Movement here (not F.F.F.  (wouldn't be the same name (wouldn't
it?  (How to get out of these brackets?  (Heeeeelp!))))))

Ehrm,  yes  we  announce  not-so-proudly-anymore the birth of F.F.F.F.!  We like
that name, it has so many dots and "F's"...

If  you  ask  us  there are much too few paymembers!  No one has asked us yet to
join  the  MARVELLOUS(!)  LUNATICS BALL staff at reasonable prizes, so we demand
more payings!

Abo's  are  plainly  cool!  We would sell our grandma for some good money - does
anyone need a granny?  81 years old...  Ok, ok, you'll get some boni for the age.
Let's  say 6.37% as this seems absolutely stupid (which is the nearer definition
of the free market).

F.F.F.F.   will  do  no  actions  accept for being existant.  We have soooo many
inofficial members that there would be no use in having official members.

So,  dear  cracker,  seller and other assholes:  Take out a white t-shirt and an
Edding(tm)  and  paint  "INOFFICIAL  F.F.F.F.-SUPPORTER" on it.  Show solidarity
towards your arch-fiends!  The Friends, we are talking about here...

Whilst  the  F.F.F.   has  to  do  highly moralic "parody" demos (for which they
already excused themselves for being offensive before they've been released), we
simply stretch out our middle-finger.  Guess who will win? ("Pffffrth!")

A friendship movement! What next? The-hugg-my-girlfriend-movement? 

And  listen  to  this:   "So  coders,  graphicians  or  musicians are especially
welcomed, but also swappers or even traders and sysops to spread the productions
around."  These  are original words from the F.F.F.-tribe.  Seems like there are
more and less worthy "friends", eh?  Swappers and especially traders/sysops seem
to  be  less  good  friends  as  they  don't  produce  something  for the mighty
"movement".   Well,  as  one  needs  them, they are allowed to participate.  How
mercyful!  What for a friendly gesture...

Two further questions from the F.F.F.-clan:  "Do you think it's cool to cheat in
any  charts?   Do  you  want  to pay for everything in the scene?" Answer to the
first:   Are  charts  friendly  in the end, idiots?  Charts are a sign for tried
superiority  which  means  oppressing  others, deviding the scene in "Elite" and
"Lamers".   So where is friendship in charts anyway?  The second one I'd simply
like to answer with another question:  Who the heck  w o u l d  pay for anything
in the scene?

Being friendly to others is a manner - not a matter of joining.  If your parents
haven't  taught you to be a nice personae, you won't become one just because you
signed in for a team like F.F.F. Simple like that.

F.F.F.F.  is the future.  One doesn't have to sign in and join, one hasn't to do
anything for it.  If you are an asshole, you are member - so keep on selling.

Real friends don't need you anyway...
