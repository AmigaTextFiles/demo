There it was.  The first sight of what soon would be the sun made itself visible
through the immense morning mist; small, tender rays of light searched their way
through thousands of miles of nothing down to Lake Vanern, Sweden.  Creatures of
the  night,  like  for  example the eel and the wels that hunted in the tranquil
water  of  Lake  Vanern  and the hundreds of species of flies and gnats that had
enjoyed  the darkness, began to seek shelter form the sharp light that we humans
so  inconsiderate call day.  Instead, the first salmon and trout started to hunt
in  the early light of dawn.  It was all a chain, really; the dayliving fish ate
what the nightliving ones rejected and vice versa.

Mathias  saw  all  this  as he stood on the shore.  He knew most of what anybody
ever  would  want  to  know about the fish species of Lake Vanern.  After all, a
fisherman  of  Mathias' calibre had no choice but to learn such things.  And how
could  he, after all these years of fishing, after all these draughts, after all
those countless hours of lecturing, possibly eluded to learn?

Mathias  had  brought  but  one  rod this morning.  He laughed for himself as he
thought  of  those  so  called  fishermen  that  brought  tons  and  yet tons of
neon-coloured  fishing equipment and still walked away empty-handed when it came
to  fish.   No,  the  real  fish,  the shrewd ones, were always very cunning and
clever.   You  had  to be one with the water if you wanted to catch one.  It had
taken Mathias years to become one with water, one with nature, one with himself,
but  it  sure had been worth it:  he was looked up to and admired far beyond his
circle of friends; Mathias was known throughout most parts of Sweden as being on
of the greatest fishermen.

If you wanted to catch fish, you had to consider them as being worthy opponents,
not  just as fish or pure objects.  No, fish had personalities they too, Mathias
knew  that.   Not  one single fish had its alike.  The elder and more hardened a
fish  got,  the  more smart and astle you could expect it to be.  Fish were like
humans  when  it  came  to  intelligence.
Not math or reading, of course, but understanding, connecting movements or sound
with   danger  or  food  and  remembering  /  identifying   places,  colours  and
occurrences.  God, did he admire them!  This was going to be a great day, he was
sure about that.

It  was  not  there  anymore.   Mathias woke up from his sleep, feeling somewhat
refreshed  and happy.  Eight-year-old Mathias suffered from muscular atrophy and
had quite recently had to get used to living in a wheel-chair.  He had only gone
fishing once during his whole life, and that was when he still could walk.  Man,
did  he dream about doing it again!  Mathias' parents had never told him that he
would  never  go  fishing  again  (or  do  anything else either for that matter;
muscular atrophy always resulted in kingdom come), they did not want to take his
dream  away from him.  Another day of the great fisherman Mathias' life had just
begun.
