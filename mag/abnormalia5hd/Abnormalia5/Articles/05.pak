2                                By Puh of Agony


She  had  been  born  in  England  by German parents sixty-eight years ago.  Her
parents  had  not  only given her the German name Grete Hansen but also a proper
education in German customs, culture, morals and language, which resulted in her
being somewhat German although she lived in Great Britain during her whole life.

From  the moment she started to think, from the moment children realize that all
other  children  are  not  equal  members  of  the  game,  she had known she was
different.  Her German accent aroused laughs from some children, and even though
laughs  are  but  movements  of  air,  those  laughs lay the ground for a coming
understanding of hers.  Nobody was ever rude or so against her, but she felt she
was  something of an...  ...outsider.  After all she was German, at least to the
origin.

She grew up, got married and settled down in a small village outside Nottingham.
Yes,  she was married to an English farmer, and yes, she occasionally spent time
with  her  English  neighbours,  but  no,  she  had no true friends.  She was an
outsider, she was German.

Her  husband  died  when  she  was  sixty-four,  and four years later, the first
tendencies of senility began to make themselves heard and she decided to move to
an  Old  People's  Home.   At  least, she would meet friends, people in the same
situation,  kind  people, there.  She decided to travel to Germany and spend her
last  years  at  an  Old  People's  Home there.  In Germany, she would not be an
outsider anymore; in Germany, she would be welcome.

"Oh.   You  are  the English woman.  Welcome." they told her at the Old People's
Home in Germany.  She left two weeks later.  Nobody had acted rudely in any way,
but she was an outsider there, she was English.

"Oh.   You  are  the  German woman.  Welcome." they told her at the Old People's
home in England.  She took her life two weeks later.
