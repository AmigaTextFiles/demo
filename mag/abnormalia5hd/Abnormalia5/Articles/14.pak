"You  are  childish,  stupid,  silly.   Your jokes are ridiculous and evil, your
remarks  are  strong and out of place.  You are aggressive, jealous, possessive.
I have my own life, I need my space, I don't like the time passed with you.  You
are  an idiot, you ruined everything, you can't understand where are the limits,
when  it's  time  to think, to stop.  You are a bastard, you are a fool, you are
egoist,  individualist,  narcisist.  You believe that the others are useless, at
your  complete  disposal.  You think to be that important, that big, that great.
You are just an idiot, good bye."

"Paola,  you  still  love  me.   Your  insults  reveal me that.  You have strong
feelings  towards  me,  your hatred is your love, you can't live without me.  We
have  been  together for three years, you have loved me more than everyone else,
you  are  born  to  be  my woman.  I need to give you and me another chance, I'm
sorry,  we  have  still many things to share.  Our relation can't stop in such a
way.  Come back, I wait you."

"Once again you haven't understood anything. Fuck off."


The  dream of Renato begins with these letters.  Or maybe it just continues with
them.   He has shown them to me, commenting them with a strange impossible smile
on  the  face.  Maybe he is really an idiot, probably he is still dreaming, like
he has always done, confusing reality with his fantasies.
Renato  is  a  friend, I understand him.  Sometimes he is not nice, sometimes he
behaves badly with his friends, but I like him, after all, he is a friend.
Yesterday  he  was here, he gave me the letters, he smiled, I've said, he looked
at me with interrogative eyes.  Paola doesn't love him anymore, that's sure, she
is  too  fed up of his behaviour, she can't stand him anymore.  I understand her
too, sometimes living with Renato may be too hard.
I  like  her,  she  is  a  friend too.  I cannot say who is right, they are both
friends.
I  have  many friends.  Sometimes they come to visit me, they confide themselves
with me, they tell me about their love affairs, about their adventures, I always
listen, that's why they like me.  "Alessandro", they use to tell me, "you really
can understand us, you are a friend".


- Why he has done something like that, Renato?
- I don't know... we have to understand him...
- Yes,  yes,  but that was really too much,  it seems like he wanted to ruin our
  relation.
- Well,  now  it's  all  over, Paola.  Probably it was just a joke,  he likes to
  joke, you know that.
- Yes,  but  this  time it was too much...   Renato, I think he really wanted to
  make us quarrel.
- Uhm...
- I think that Alessandro likes me.
- He  loves  you, Paola,  just look at how he talks to you.  But we have to help
  him, we are his only friends, forgive him, forget the joke.  He has just us, I
  think.


I've  heard  Renato  talking with himself.  He pretended to talk with Paola, I'm
really sad for him, he is really strange these days, probably he hasn't accepted
the  idea.   I  have  talked  with  Paola,  she  really wants to break with him,
forever.  I don't know what to do.  Renato needs help, his dream is bringing him
too far, he is building a personal reality too distorted, his mind is losing the
grasp of the real things. I should help him, show him the true reality.


"Hallo  Alessandro!   Greetings  from Spain!
Here it's full of sun, beaches and girls!  (Boys!  -Paola) 
Is  life  in  Milano always hot??
CU soon!  Renato - Paola"


Even  the  postcard,  Renato  has  done  that  too.   I don't condemn him, I can
understand  his  despair.  Paola hasn't followed him this time, they were not on
holidays together.  But who cares, after all, if he is happy with his fantasies.
The  last  months  I  have  been  in Paris.  I was there, living in my own room,
meeting  a lot of people, studying and working in a biology laboratory.  Applied
research.   I  was  there,  maybe  in these months Renato has lost mental sanity
faster than expected.  I couldn't help him, I was in Paris.


A dreamer must be a strange guy, maybe he is really happy, maybe he finds in his
own  invented  reality what he can't find for real.  A dreamer has to be helped,
you cannot tear away his dream, you cannot ruin his psyche brutally.
Maybe,  after all, his fantasies are the only important things, the only reality
worth to be lived, maybe they are reality and our reality is fantasy.
You  can  dream  foreign countries and different worlds, an adventurous life all
around the globe.
You  can dream wonderful women, you can dream Paola, wonderful long hairs around
sweet tender eyes, is it really important if she is made of neurons?
