Again I was standing on the edge of balcony, thinking what I am really doing?
"Good  place  for jumping!", thought my humourous side, but this was already the
third  time  in  this week when I watched a road 20 meters under my feet.  So it
didn't  make  me  laugh  anymore.  And always I heard a phono playing a same old
song in my head:"Should I stay or should I go?" Somehow it had stucked and those
were  only  lines  which  a  vocalist  sung with a unconcerned and boring voice.
Somewhere  down somebody whispered:"You should go...", but when I turned my head
I didn't see no one there.

In  the  earlier  dreams  I  didn't  jump,  I always was too afraid to do it and
something  made  me  to  stay.   Though  I always thought:"This is just a dream,
nothing  can  happen  to  me!", I just couldn't do it.  Something warned me, but
why?

Then  suddenly I started to think about these dreams.  Maybe they will follow me
until  I  make  a right decision.  "Do I have to jump to solve this problem?", I
thought.   This  made  me  more nervous, I wasn't any longer so sure what to do,
when  some  minutes  ago I thought just to wake up.  Somewhere a crowd of people
appeared  to  the  road and there was more to come.  They were looking at me and
again I heard someone to whisper:"It's good a place for jumping, come down, come
down..."  A  crowd, which seem to increased very hugely, participate in a silent
whisper.  All they were humming:"Come down, come down, come down..."

Now  I  knew  what was my duty.  I had to jump, so they all would be happy and I
could  see  the  other  dreams.  I calmed my nerve and let my grip from balcony.
Road  was  coming  fastly  towards  me and I had a slightest idea that something
wasn't still wrong.

Earlier  I have seen dreams where it's easy to fly, just jump to nowhere and let
the  mind  choose  where to go.  It felt so strange to see everything from above
like  on  the  eyes  of  a  bird.   This time road was still coming, but I still
thought there nothing to worry about.

But  when  I  touched  the ground I realized in a couple of milliseconds that it
wasn't a dream at all...
