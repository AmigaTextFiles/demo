     Year 2232: The free state of Dethre disembarks some troups in the 
                near Canzia. It's the civil war. F55 strafing and 
                bombing the city. 

He was standing in front of me.
My forehead gripping sweat.
His  boots were sounding cruel and dry on the stones.  The clear sign of a bomb.
Under his left feet, a doll with flowers on its small dress.

"And now?" He said sharply shaking his plasmagun.
No moves. He looked surprised.
"And  now?   What  are you doing on this side of the street?  Don't you know it?
Who are you?  Who the fuck are you?!"
Fear. I was smelling fear. No way out of this kind of things, you know.
After all the wars I passed through.
"Stop  it."  I  said,  lighting myself one of the cigarettes I found few minutes
before among the debris.
"Stop what?! Don't move! Fuckinchrist I SAID DON'T MOVE!"
"Stop it. You're kinda stupid."

He listened me with a sort of unbelievable tremor in his hands.
Was  his plasmagun charged?  I knew that a small move and a so nervous man could
let the trigger release a rose of fire of 25 inches round.
But I was not fearing this.

Then he talked again.
"You...   who  the hell you believe you're dealing with?!  You bastard.  Are you
here  to  rape  someone?   My wife?  My daughter?  I know your race.  You scummy
Canzian."
He realized that I was listening with attention and immediately stopped.
Silence. I threw my cigarette some steps away.
"Idiot. Have you got a family?"
He moved the head. "Yes... of course" seemed to say his eyes.
"Me too. And a job, I suppose..."
The same shadow of indecision. "Yes."
"Well...   and  now,  do you think there's a big difference between us isn't it?
Maybe you're the kind of guy who think to the Holy Flag, aren't you?"
"I just know that your nation wanted us to attack.  You are irritating us.  From
years.   You  Canzian.   You  came  in our state.  You subtract us our job.  Our
womans."
"And the same is with you Dethrian." I said calmly.
"Yes...   because  you  subtracted  us  our  territory!   What  about  the  many
territorial skirmish Canzia begins every year?  Ehn?"

This time I started screaming.

"STOP!  But how can you be this stupid?  Can't you see?  Can't you feel it?  You
are a silly guy.  This is not MY WAR.  This is not YOUR WAR.  This is THEIR war!
How  can't  you  understand  that this kind of things is useless?  They do THEIR
war!   They  move  us to fight for THEIR interest!  What did you think that will
change  if  you  are  dominated by Canzia or Dethre?!  What will change in their
minds  if  you DIE?  What if your wife DIES?  You really think there's something
important for them?!  Did you really think that this WAR will solve our problem?
Will  make  water less radioactive or will find a job to my son?  Did you really
think that your problems are differents by the problems of a Canzian?  STOP IT!
Did  you  really  think  that a different race, or any race, can have advantages
from a war of any type?
I'm a man. You're a man.
Lay your plasmagun.
Go away.
Let me search for another cigarette.
I'm tired."

He looked at me with emptyness.
We stood for some minutes standing one in front the other.
A tear was falling on his lether face.
A  tear full of bitter.  Painful.  Full of fear.  Fear for a family and fear for
the  uncertain  future.  The same uncertain future that was ahead for his people
and for mine.
He putted his plasmagun on his shoulder, looked down.
As he came, he gave me his back and headed home.

It was not difficult for me to quickly jump behind him and cut his throat.
Fucking Dethrian's scum!
