"Who murdered me?", I asked after someone blowed my brains to the walls.
What  an  astonishing  moment!   I  was  looking  outside  window,  watching the
beautiful  garden  and wasn't thinking that it would have been last thing I saw.
Then came some moron who have decided that my existence isn't not so important.

"What  a  hell,  it's  just  an old stupid-looking guy, luckily you didn't break
anything  expensive.",  I heard somebody to say and that hurted me!  "If I had a
hammer...",  I  thought,  but at the moment it was quite hard to do.  However, I
find  out  that  walking was much easier and the first time I really didn't have
any problems with weight.  Scale didn't move, so I thought I had made the record
of the Weight Watchers.  Same things can't be said about my killer, who seems to
find  my refrigerator full of food.  It was the second time when it hurted.  Why
he  killed me before lunch?  And hey!  Don't you eat slice of pizza, which I was
supposed to eat tomorrow!!!

To  calm me down, I really needed a drink.  Does a ghost drink alcohol, is there
any  drunken  ghost,  well,  now  there  is!   Hmm,  I  hope  can drink at least
something?!?

My  disappointment  was  huge, bigger than Empire State Building, when I noticed
that  I  couldn't  touch anything.  Even leaning to the wall wasn't a good idea,
then  I  found  myself  falling  to a bedroom and my feet were still in a living
room.   Well,  I  thought  how it's possible to walk (or fall like in this case)
through the ceiling though I can't fall to the cellar which was downstairs.  And
again  I noticed that something was wrong, well, of course after becoming ghost.
Somehow  I  was  somewhere  between  cellar and bedroom.  There is for sure many
ghost things and tricks which I have to learn...

Later, after hard work I have some touch to being ghost.  It sounds weird, but I
really  didn't  know how hard work is scaring people, to invent and do all those
awful  tricks.   Actually,  I didn't know that there's ghost after being one.  I
love  my  new job, this is more fun than thinking where the hell has disappeared
all the power from this stupid computer.  Earlier I really like to tease people,
but I usually didn't have a courage, now I even get paid for it!
"Paid?!?",  you  may  wonder,  but  like  in  real  life, nowadays you don't get
anything for free...
