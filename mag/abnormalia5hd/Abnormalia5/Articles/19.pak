I  like  her.   I  do  not know if she likes me, but I like her, no doubts.
Every  evening  I  have  the  opportunity  to  meet her I realize she's the most
admired but also the best accomplished girl of the place, and the very same time
she passes close to me I can't speak nor move.
The  light  from the ball-shaped lamp is falling on her neck and arms, and under
that  cheated  light her blond-coloured hair and fair skin make strange contrast
with her dark brown eyes.
She starts to dance in front of me. 
She's  shaking her body drawing strange shapes in the air by her hands and arms.
The rythm is growing, the air is becoming impossible to breath, at least for me;
the  music  is invading my soul, and because of the alcool, I am unable to reach
and rationalize the situation.
I  glance at her, trying to avoid her look:  I'm not in the mood to talk to her,
but,  to  tell  the  truth,  I'm never in the right mood, I've never been in the
right  mood,  also if I perfectly realize this is just an excuse, a mask to hide
the fact I'm terribly shy and unable to face these situations.
The  very  same time I decide to leave my eyes meet her.  I can't avoid her look
this time.  Helped by the alcool's effects I smile at her and start to chat.  At
first  words  find  very  difficult to go out from my mouth.  My tongue is still
tied  to  my  brain  but,  luckily, after some minutes the tongue starts to move
alone, the brain is left, abandoned, and I'm happy about it.
It's  more  than  one  year  that  I  know  her, even last summer I used to chat
sometimes,  but  I  did not care too much.  It has happened just some weeks ago,
while  we  were  talking a bit.  I found her very clever and, day after day, day
after day something in my soul born.
Outside  the  disco there's water, water everywhere, it's raining dogs and cats,
but I do not care too much.  I'm speaking with her and nothing else matters.
After  more  than half an hour the music stops and all the lights are turned on,
suddendly.   It's  like to land on the Earth after a long voyage across the sky,
to  be back after a long time, I understand again what's happening around me but
I  can't do anything.  She stops talking waiting for something from me, but I do
not know what to say.  Seconds pass in a icelike silence.
My  brain  restarts  to  work.   He's  telling me just two words.  "Carpe diem",
"Seize  the  day",  and  these words are repeated and repeated, together with an
increasing  of  the  heartbeat, almost panting.  I can't hear what I'm saying, I
don't know why, but the sound of my words "Wanna have a walk?" does not reach my
hears.  "Yes" she replies, but this time I can hear perfectly.  Luckily it's not
raining  anymore  and  also if the air is still wet we can start to walk without
problems.
Everything seems so beauty while I'm walking with her, and when my fingers graze
her skin she starts to smile looking to my eyes seeing what she's meaning to me.
"I have to go now, I'm late..." she whispers, moving her head near my face.
"See you tommorow" I reply and closing my eyes I kiss her lips.
But  her  lips  have  a  strange taste.  They are something unreal which I can't
touch nor feel.  Even her body seems to become something so far from me.
Maybe  it's  because  I'm just waking up, after hours of deep sleep.  My head is
still  on  my  pillow,  and  my  whole  body  is  still laying on the bed.  It's
everything like it was yesterday evening when I decided to go to sleep.
Perhaps  there's one difference, I've something on my face, that is falling from
my eyes...  Some tears of pain.
