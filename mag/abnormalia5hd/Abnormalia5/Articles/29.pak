People  always need to imagine...  But what will be after death?  -is a question
that tortured all people already.  Few people may give exact answers.
Not  to  exclude  is the majority of human population telling you, that there is
nothing  after  death,  a black hole without thinking, without signs of life and
without  thoughts.   Nearly  all  think so, but hope to find something different
behind  their  poor  life  of  work,  of pains and little pleasure.  Human can't
imagine that everything just fades away.  You seem to be dead then.

I  am writing about pure atheists who don't accept religions to live under.  Our
problem,  I  am  dealing with, is maybe one of the most important sources of the
development  and  founding of religions.  We are always in search of identity, a
deeper  sense  of  life.   Animal  are  living  to keep their species alive.  So
people,  despite of their lifted civilization and style of living and with their
power  to  destroy,  need  to  live this way too.  But "why the heck, human need
explosions  of  population,  education  of  our  kind, wars...?"-you may ask.  A
source  may  be  that  people are afraid of death.  Human need to perpetuate and
that  is  a  magnificent  reason  for  our  acting,  why  people  try  to  reach
acknowledgement in the society.  Some egoistic behaviour cause mass exodus, war.
Only  people  with  fatalistic  attitudes  towards life can act as destroyers of
future.

So  what will be then?  Do our soul reincarnate into a body?  If my life reaches
acknowledgement in my society, then I may get an human body to incarnate in?  If
I  am  bad, an asocial parasite of society I may get a soul of an insect or even
microbe?   May  my  soul  reaches  heaven?   That  would  be interesting knowing
everything, flying around with angels wings and an instrument to spread harmony!
Even more interesting would be hell - bodies, curled of pain inside burning hell
-  with  rising flames - insanity, madness fills the air - evil eyes follow pain
in hot hate as payment for your worldly crimes.

Human  always  invented models of afterlife to keep uneducated masses under rule
and  control.   People  believe in something overnatural which is natural at the
same  moment.   I respect religions out of traditions and breeding.  People, who
aren't  atheists  have less problems in my case.  They have something to believe
in  -  we haven't.  We try to analyze natural processes with our poor knowledge.
Erich  von  Daeniken - a german-writing author from Switzerland and traveller of
mystic places seems to have found theories, that wake hope in us.

Our  decadent  culture  don't  accepts  theories  like that, but "uneducated and
uncivilizated"  peoples  believe  in  that  over  hundreds  of  generations.  It
startles,  that  inhabitants  of  small  isles  around  the  globe  have similar
religions  and  myths.   We  are  getting  away  from our subject, let's return.
Daeniken  writes  about electrons which contain thoughts and get lost.  This way
he  explains how soothsayers work.  They know, or have the ability to decode and
to  catch  those  electrons.  So they "read" the thoughts containing.  Expressed
this  way  is,  that soothsayers can only transmit scrap - single scenes - often
only moments with strange pictures.  It is a very adventurous theory.

With  our  actual  scientific  methods  we  aren't  able to find out, but in our
natural  quest in the meaning of life we seem to be more happy with this theory,
than with simple uncomplicated death.

Is  humanity  a  test?   Are  we  made  to  be  guinea  pigs by interplanetar or
terrestrial  species?   These  questions  torture.  If I'll start thinking about
undefined  objects, extraterrestrial living existence I'll sooner or later start
writing  about  the  endless  and  infinite  space  of universe, it's source and
development.   Life,  earth,  universe  is obscure - maybe it all doesn't exist.
For  what  do  we  need  society, behaviour, culture?  Maybe I am actually in an
holographic projection, and nothing is real?

A deep, mental crisis tortures us.  In our surrounding we'll never find answers,
but only alive it is possible to find them.

So  stay  alive,  influence  on  your society, don't use subcultures, integrate,
otherwise society will kill you!
