         I am a time traveller, buddy. Don't look at me so strange... 
               My name is Patrick Skuller, and I'll born in 2217.
               No, I'm not insane. Well, not completely. Not yet.
    I know that you still haven't discovered the theory of time-travelling:
             it will be developed only in the year 2163 by Yamashi.
                    So, at the moment, you have to trust me.
           Well, I'm a time traveller and I'm actually drunk as hell.
               Oh yeah. People love to get drunk also in my age.
                    My What? God? What did you mean with... 
                       ah, you're a believer aren't you?

Listen  buddy.  And listen with attention because I'm not going to repeat myself
a second time.

You  know  what?  There's just one thing I really can't understand of your time:
the recursivity of your errors.
I  mean,  I've  travelled up and down in time and I've seen a lot of things that
you  could  never  dream of but I've never understood how the hell you can be so
damned stupid.
Look,  I had a lot of girls...I remember some in the pre-columbian Canada.  Some
"RedSkins"  ya  know...   oh well, they were just special.  But also in that age
they all  were  learning  from  errors.  After the second time I went there they
started  hiding  their women.  In the middle-age of Japan I had more lovers than
nights  of  rest and after some months I became an outlaw.  I've played a lot of
different  games,  I drunk hundreds of different wines and sometime I think that
I've killed more people than the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
Don't look me so strange! I would like to see you in my position!
Would  you  like  to  be  persecuted  by  husbands ?  And challenged by romantic
lovers?   And  shooted  by hysteric women ?  So, you have to kill someone if you
need to survive, sometime.  So, as you see I've seen a lot of things.
Tell me. Ya still have a pope haven't you ? Uh ? What does it means?
Well...   nothing.   I've  not  to  speak,  you know...  all that shit about the
linearity   of   the   time   and  the  aberration  of  it  when  you  speak  to
non-traveller...   Of course I don't really think so.  A lot of others traveller
made  so  many errors that now you wonder, eheheh...  you wonder how the hell is
possible all that stuff that you call "mysterious".  The column of unknown steel
league in Delhi...
The  bisont  skull  with  the  bullet  hole  in  the  middle...  All that little
reproductions  of planes in South America...That strange indians tales about the
flying  "Mana"...and  the  Egyptian  picture  in  the  pyramid that was drawn in
complete  darkness...and  the  four  perfect  diamonds  found  in that stone-age
cave...  uh...  no, you still haven't found it, isn't it?
Hum. Maybe you're right. Who care ? One less or one more...
And  also  another "screwdriver"...  I think that at this point it makes no real
difference, isn't it?  So ask it another also for me, thanx.

Have you have ever thought about the church seriously?
In the beginning the religion was based upon a lot of different things...
The lightning, the fire, the waves of the sea and other things.
But slowly people was beginning to study the things.
So the fire was not just from God, the lightnings became atmospherical phenomena
and the heart was not in the middle of the universe.
At  the  beginning, the church, started burning people but I guess they were not
able to burn the whole world, so, at a certain moment, they started telling like
"Oh  no...we're  a new kind of religion...  the church have made a lot of errors
but  now  is  different.   You  see,  we  all  follow  the  word of the Lord and
blablabla..."
And then the church decreased the theoretical dominion of God on the earth.
And so on... until just a couple of things was standing against the science.
The unexplorable things. Death, buddy... and the origin of the universe. 

And of course your actual church stand just with this topic because they are the
only  topic  that  they're sure nobody will never break down, and of course they
say  that the old church was full of hypocrite people but now is different.  You
know,  When  Yamashi  developed the time-travel theory there was a lot of people
that  asked  for various expeditions in a lot of places and a lot of others that
immediately stopped to talk about their "Untouchable faiths".  All the people in
Jeovah's  Witness  asked  for a trip ten thousand years before christ to show to
the  world  that the man was not existing before that moment and they obtained a
great  result  in  knowing  that the human race was on the earth fourty thousand
years  before Christ and that Christ himself never made a single miracle because
he was just a charismatic speaker.
Of course the association of Jeovah's Witness yelled for some months that it was
all a mystification, before disappear.
The  extremist of nationalist movements, or well...  fascism or nazism, ya know,
asked  for  a travel in the Germany of the world war to state that there were no
lager  and  there was no genocide but the results of that first expedition never
reached home with their news.
The  fascist forces in Italy, leaded by Benito Mussolini, caught the men of that
expedition  and sent them to die in a nazist lager in Auschwitz.  How funny.  Of
course that nationalist movement disappeared.

And  so  on  until someone, not so later, asked for a travel at the beginning of
the time.  At the beginning of the universe.
Well,  there  was  need of eleven expedition before founding the real beginning.
And  you  know  ?   Then  they  discovered  that there's no real beginning.  The
universe goes on exploding and returning to his middle.
And  so  on,  infinitely.   Oh  well,  the  big explosion happens because of the
oscillation  of quantum and the magnification of the penthial and this mean that
no  God  created anything for sure because now we are able to reproduce the same
thing  in  a  lab.  The magnification of the penthial was decisive and essential
to...Uh ?  A penthial ?  Get lost, it's a long story.
Ok, I was telling you about the church...guess what?
It  became  the  "New  Universal  Religion Church" leaving the old definition of
"Holy  Roman Church".  How funny.  Then the only thing that remained to them was
the  death,  but,  at  that  point,  nobody  wanted to believe in that false and
hypocrite thing that the church had became.
No foundation because of NO Holy Christ and no concrete creation of the material
world.   At  the  end,  the  church started proposing new strange bibles talking
about  new theories  wanting  God  as  an invisible eye that looks at us without
interfere  and  that wait until we die to introduce us to a new kind of world in
which he is a sort of guardian.  That's it.
So, at that point, as you can easily imagine, buddy...
...The official church joined his creator, in other words: disappeared.

Well...well...   so?   Are you still willing to go and pray in churches now?  Do
ya still believe in a God?  ...your silence is more than enough.
Hey... but don't let yourself go down in this way !!
And now...  let's talk about something funny!  Ah, but first...  do me a favour,
want  you?   Ask  for me another "screwdriver" to the girl at the bar...and when
you are already there...  ask her to come to our table.
You know what I mean...I've ever loved brunettes.
