2                             BY RokDaZone of Infect


Bending  in  his own excrements, the emperor - like a fallen god - found himself
back  in  the  stinking  hot carcers of his own reign.  Easy to say...  revolte,
revolution, civil war and war.  This time however, the people he brought to this
jail of forgetting turned the key of power.

The  jail  of  forgetting  was  much  a  dustbin for the battlers and battled of
history.    A   history,   the   fallen   emperor  dictated  through  money  and
weapon-supply.

Never  he  even  thought about the possibility of loosing his position.  His own
courtly  administrators  were the only ones, he feared but giving them enough to
feed  from  the poor and some illusionary plays of tranquilising peaceful living
made them become fat and content.  So he had nothing to fear.

Yet  then, times changed and history took its own path again.  It all started in
small  colonies  of  his  world-enveloping empire.  Some battles here and there,
some closed down mines and full landscapes savaged.  Environmentalists (for long
time  he  even  didn't  know  how to spell that) intoxicated the thinking of the
people and therefore their feeling towards him and his state.

When  here  and there, regional battles started to be racial conflicts, also the
youth of his own inner nation started to provoke stateal forces.
Anarchists  in his own nation!  Yet, their parents often members of the cultural
and  economical  elite  prevent  him  from  rigorous sanctions against the young
troublemakers.   Movements  appeared  and  went,  but  with  every just so small
movement of people, the politiciation of his slaving population stepped forth.

It  was  while  a  bitter  demonstration  of  several hundred radicals in a more
important colony when he first felt like this dark evolution had taken grip over
his  own  troops  as  they  beat the demonstrators away - yet didn't shoot as he
demanded.  Open obeyance!  A shock for the emperor...

Civil  wars  he  iniciated  for  the  amusement  of his people turned to his own
misfortune  since  the changed attitudes towards his reign made the minds become
more human less animalistic and with favor for primitive shows of butchery.

People  raged  and  told  him to stop wars by military interventions.  Yes, they
demanded he should sent out his own elitetroops - neither he nor his troops were
much  in  favor  of  this  thought, obviously...  Unbelievable things started to
appear:   Wars  and  civil wars launched by themselves and he really got worried
when  single  colonies  started  to  declare  themselves  as  being independent,
seperate  and  sovereign - under the applaude of his followers!  The first three
colonies  were  lucky  and he left him out of hands, knowing they would end like
himself and sooner or later become part of his influential body somedays again.

As  more and more regions started to revolt, he demanded halt by his troops, but
while  they were protecting his reign to the outside, his fall got nearer in the
inner  and  he  wasn't  able  to  stop  this.  The unlucky miserable day finally
arrived  that  his troops got overwhelmed by fiendish forces and they vanished -
or became part of the enemy.  Now it only was a question of time for his fall to
set  in.   Especially  since  his  direct  followers started to feel the loss of
quality  in  living.   The turned their backs on him.  After a short time he was
left alone.  When they found him, being only a shadow of himself, they took him.
Not  like a statesman or a criminal.  No, they took him like the old man that he
was and threw him into the jail of forgetting, that he had build for his private
enemies.  He remained nothing but an image for the following generations.

The time? Centuries and centuries hence.
The emperor? Capital.
