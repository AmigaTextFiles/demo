Fighting way through a lane filled with obstacles might appear disgraceful.

Left everything turns left.  No way of moving to another side or even to return.

Having  taken  this  lane,  I keep on walking, turning left.  No crossroad.
Left, left, left.

Huge  stairs in my way, each one one metre of height, seemingly endless.  I keep
on climbing.  Left, left, left.

The  ground is grey - no - more of a violently violet-dark-grey.  Shadows in all
directions yet no source of light.

Oh,  I  enjoy this way to walk.  Walking, climbing, turning left towards a black
hole  in  front  of  me,  build out of violently violet-dark-grey one metre high
stairs.  I enjoy this way, because it is you, who is this way, eternally turning
left.  Not very sharp turning left, just turning left.
Silently.  Eternally.  Frightfully.

Stairs  that  lift  me to the same height I have stood upon before, unrationally
turning left.

I  hate  this  way  and  I fight it, try to break free, try to return.  Yet, the
stairs  back  are  each three metres in size.  No way to return, to face the way
going  right,  right  right.   Arrested  in my freedom.  Chained and fixed in my
movement.  I go left.  Left, left, left.

A spiral I am walking in.  Spiralling always alike never changing its direction.
Left,  left,  left.   Always  I  wander in this spiral to wander with you in our
life,  but  the  way  never  changes.  Like a piece of railway it goes straight,
never changing, one direction.

Don't clamber, reach your hands towards me as I reach mine towards you!  Let use
tear  this spiral down.  Let us make the stairs become even!  Let's stop walking
left.

I  run  with  my  head  into the walls - these violently violet-dark-grey rocks,
walls,  hamperings.   Lift  my  fists,  smash  them  against this bollwerk which
appears to be us and our relation.  A way out!  No.

I thought to have broken through.  To have changed the walls.  Make them stop to
turn left, left, left.

Yet, you couldn't follow, as it is you and me who is the spiral.  We two as one.
We aren't - we is.  One and the same in a spiral of stairs.

For  a  frictous  moment  I  stood  outside, yet it was you who was lacking.  We
parted, were two again.  We isn't - we are.

I stood outside, nearly but you were in.

I  want  to  get you out, but you are the spiral.  I want to become one with you
again,  but  I  fear  the spiral.  This evil violently violet-dark-grey building
that never stops turning left, left, left.

I stand outside, yet can't leave.

Fearing the inside, fearing the outside.

I am left, left, left.
