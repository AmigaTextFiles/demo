----[ Main Body ]---------------------------------------------------------------

-Listen...I really have to talk with somebody. Last night I had a strange dream.

Said the first.

-What kind of dream ?

Said the other.

-Well... come with me. Let's find an empty room.
-But... I was playing... well.. it doesn't matter. Let's go.

The two exit.

-Ok... here we are. What's wrong with that dream ?
-Hmmm... Nothing wrong, just the feelings.
-I'm listening.
-Well,  I  felt  like  I was just awakened from a long dream.  I mean:  when you
 have  a  nightmare  you commonly feel as the situation is real so that when you
 wake up you happily remember that the real thing it's different.  Isn't it ?
-Got it.
-This  is  what  I felt in the dream.  I was in a strange situation that I can't
 explain.   I  was just "different".  Try to imagine yourself being able to move
 another part of you.  A part that you don't have.
-You mean... like another hand ?
-Exactly.  You cannot imagine the procedure just because you never used it.  And
 you never used that procedure just because your body doesn't have the structure
 to support another hand.
-Yes. And so ? Did your dream was about yourself with two dicks ?
-Stop that, sucker. I'm really scared.
-Hummm... I see, ok. Sorry.
-In  my  dream  I  clearly  felt just like there's something "around" me.  No...
 that's incorrect.  I felt that ALL of this was...  unreal.
-Unreal ? What you mean ?
-It's  a  construction.   The  dream  was inspiring me a thought that reduced in
 words  should sound a sort of:  "When you are here you are awaken, when you are
 there you are sleeping".
 Of  course  there  are  some  concepts  I'm not able to "translate"...  but the
 general meaning of the dream was this.
-What kind of concepts ?
-The  last  words...   <<  When  you are there you are SLEEPING >>.  They're not
 right.   Was not "SLEEPING".  It's something different but that's the word that
 comes  near  to  that idea.  I think that the right concept should be something
 like:   <<...you-are-not-at-a-full-consciousness-of-yourself.   >>  But I'm not
 sure.
-That's interesting. Maybe I have the solution for you.

The first shut up for some seconds.

-Tell me. Any suggestion is really welcome.
-There's  an  association I heard about few days ago.  Your words reminds me the
 man  from  that  association.   He  talked  in  the same way about that kind of
 "Second dimension".
-Tell me more. I'm really scared. All was so... so real.
-Yes.   They  said  that  sometimes we  can perceive this state of thing when we
 dream.  It happened also to others...  if you want, we can try to contact other
 people with the same experience.
-I  don't  know.  We'll talk later about that.  For the moment I just would like
 to understand more.
-Yes... that's right.
-You  see.   In  this  moment  too,  I  perceive  this reality as a fiction.  To
 understand  me,  try to imagine that for a moment you have perceived your third
 hand  and  you have moved it but now you can't see it.  You know that your hand
 is  somewhere  but  you  can't remember where.  The only thing that you know is
 that your third hand DOES exist.
-Ok... Ok... calm down now.
-Yes, Sorry. I... I don't know what's happening to me.
-Don't worry. Tomorrow we'll contact someone in that association, ok ?
-Yes... thank you very much. I... I really needed to talk with...
-Oh... Get lost. In my opinion you just need some rest.
-You're right. I'll go to the main vector base.
-That's good.  Relax and you'll see.  Now I have to go.  My connection time with
 the chat room is about to expire.
-Yes... mine too.  I've withdrawn some minutes yesterday for my wife and today I
 can't take it anymore.
-That's bad... also my wife spends all of my time in privates chat rooms.
-Don't even talk me about that.
-I'll go.  I have to remap the brush wrapping of the vectocar.  See you tomorrow
 ok ?
-Ok... I'll let you go now. Have a nice connection.
-Thank you. May the Matrix lead your vectors in the right.

The  first vanishes.  The second stay some seconds recomputing something then he
vanishes too.
