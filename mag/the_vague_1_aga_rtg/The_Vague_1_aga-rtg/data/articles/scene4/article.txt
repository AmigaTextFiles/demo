 Todays scene has been possessed by the devil of ascii.~~Various groups have been
 mushrooming with the only purpose~~~to~~~produce another ascii-collection.~~~~~Well,~~~"strange
 times" one would say,~~~but the fact is that this ascii-disease is going too far!~~~~~What
 I don't really like is that the whole thing is so pushy.

 I~~~~give the ascii-makers a discrediting look whenever~~~~I~~~~~see them proud as a peacock

  in what they ~are ~doing. However, they ~don't ~seem ~to ~feel ~that confident, as they
 constantly insist on something.~~~~You can even hear them gnashing their teeth when
 they ~call ~for ~special ~~treatment, ~special ~~ascii-magazines, ~special ~ascii-packs, ~special
 ascii-charts~~~and~~~maybe even~~~~acsii-like bathing caps.~~Desperately looking~~~for~~~justification
 for their job, they claim it is pretty much as complicated and at least of ~the same
 importance ~as ~coding ~and ~making ~graphics ~or ~modules ~is. They ~also ~tend ~to ~think
 that the ascii~~~~~is embedded in what we call~~~~"the scene"~~~~and~~~~"the art". But the truth
 is quite different. The ascii-making has never been and will never be as ~rightful as
 the functions mentioned above. The reasons behind it are obvious. First of all, ascii
 is~~~~~the easiest thing to do.~~~You can contribute to the scene,~~~at~~~~~the same time being
 the ~~least ~~spectacular ~~and ~~most ~~senseless. You ~~need ~~no ~~special ~~qualifications or
 talents for it.

 The other thing is about calling ascii "an art".~~~Isn't it just an example of an abuse?
 Generally,~~~the word "art" seems to be abused in the scene. But it's not only about
 what we are doing. I watch television from time to time. Whenever I see an inter-
 -view with some excited freak talking trash about the latest exhibition of his post-
 modernist~~~~~ceramic~~~~~sculptures~~~~~series entitled~~~~"40~~~~ways~~~~to~~~~regular~~~~and~~~~easy~~~~~defecation"
 I see this as a typical ascii-maker writhing to put himself in the spotlight.

 The amiga scene~~~~has~~~~recently been coping with~~~~~an~~~~increased activity~~~~of~~~~ascii-makers
 Things got even worse. We are observing the show ~we didn't ~experience even in
 the golden years of the scene. Is it good or bad? ~Well, I ~would ~say bad. If ~these
 trends ~~~continue~, ~~it ~~is ~~~possible~, ~~that ~~~very ~~~quickly~, ~~the ~~amiga ~~scene ~~will ~~become
  dominated ~by ~the ~ascii-world. That ~would ~be ~pathetic ! But ~what ~really makes me
 speechless ~is the information that some of the amiga ascii-makers moved~~~~to~~~~pc~~~~and
 continue their job using CED~~~~~on~~~~~Amiga emulators.~~~When asked for the purpose,~~~they
 admit~~~~~that~~~~~they~~~~do~~~~it~~~~~for~~~~their Amiga-friends,~~~because the pc-ascii-scene has recently
 ~been dying out.~~~~That is just sick!~~~~I won't even comment on it,~~~because I don't know
 if ~I ~am ~supposed ~to ~laugh ~or ~cry. Honestly, I ~do ~not ~know ~how to help ~enlighten
 such ignorant people.

 I am~~~~not~~~~trying to~~~~condemn~~~~the "ascii"~~~~as~~~~a~~~~whole. I~~~~understand people being involved
 in ~ascii-making ~beside ~their ~major ~activity. It's ~no ~doubt ~that ~there ~will ~always ~be
 some miminal demand for ascii (bbs,~~~letterheads,~~~file_idz,~~~etc.),~~~but please~~~~~do~~~~~not drive
 yourselves into madness.~~~It looks like for the last couple~~~~of~~~~years we all have been
 missing ~the ~creativity. Everybody ~goes ~the ~easiest ~~way ~to ~~appear ~~on ~the ~scene.
 ~Another example ~of ~this ~is ~"photoshopping". No ~matter ~how ~much ~a ~job is ~worth,
 wouldn't~~~~~it~~~~~be~~~~~better~~~~~to~~~~~put~~~~~all~~~~~the~~~~~efforts into making~~~~~great~~~~~demos~~~~or~~~~disk-magazines
 (~anybody ~~~noticing ~~~the ~~~irony ~~~wins ~~~the ~~~drill-massage)~? ~~~That ~~~seems ~~~to ~~~be ~~~more
 complicated. Instead of releasing 40 ascii-collections ~with ~the ~same ~logos ~repeated
 (sorry, ~each ~differs from ~one ~another, ~often ~with ~one ~char, but ~this ~is ~how ~they
 work ~out ~their ~own ~style), you'd ~better ~just ~write ~one ~good ~article. Is ~it ~still ~too
 difficult? Maybe ~so. The ~ascii-making ~doesn't ~require ~thinking. All ~you ~have to keep
  in mind ~is ~"cut" and "paste" ~options ~and still ~most of the ~stuff ~contributed to ~the
 scene is created ~with the use ~of ~iff2ascii-like ~tools. But ~this ~is the Personal Paint
 that ~kicks ass! You ~can even ~adjust ~the ~way ~the dithering ~will be converted into
 the ~ascii. It's ~no ~use ~~talking ~about ~~it. Everybody ~knows ~~most ~~of ~the ~ascii-makers
 use all ~this ~software. They hide in cellars, ~not ~to ~get ~spotted by ~the ~others. ~The
 funniest ~~things ~~are ~~the ~~compositions ~~they ~~write ~~to ~~present ~~the ~~unique ~~style ~~of
 "polish ascii". Or maybe it's just me being "too picky".
