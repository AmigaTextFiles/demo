 Perfect, if you reached this point it means that:

 1 - You come from Lesson 1, so I suppose that the thing really interests you!
 2 - You already know how a ~tracker ~works ~but ~you want to read ~again about it
     a bit, especially about the commands.

 Anyway let's start back from ~where we dropped ~last ~time, ~precisely ~on ~my ~invite
 to grab tracker and instruments.~~~Good. If trying to you had problems I invite you to
 try again under my guidance.

 Got~~~~a~~~~tracker at reach of hand? (for example FastTracker2 which~~~~I~~~~strongly~~~~suggest
 you) Once ~the ~program ~is ~launched ~you ~will ~be ~in ~front ~of ~that ~screen with a lot
 of ~tracks ~and ~loads ~of ~numbers. ~Good. ~Meanwhile ~we ~need ~to ~manage ~loading ~in
 memory some instrument.~~~~Usually in these trackers there's always~~~~a menu regarding
 disk ~~operations, ~so ~~look ~~for ~~something ~~like ~~Disk ~Operation ~~or ~~something ~like ~that.
 Done yet ? ~Now ~look carefully ~and ~on ~my ~website ~you ~will ~~find ~a ~library with ~a
 moderate amount of instruments,FBY Samples Library...nothing~~~~too~~~~hilarious,~~~just what
 you need to start doing something...~~~Ok,~~~~once loaded~~~~~a~~~~~bit of samples you can start
 straight on composing something... you'd ask "how"? Simply using your ~keyboard as
  a ~real ~music ~keyboard. Every ~key ~is ~indeed (aside ~function ~keys, special keys and
 numerical keypad) a ~representation of a note. Usually ~in a ~tracker ~the ~keyboard ~is
 mapped like this:

 From "Z" to "M" notes of lower Octave
 From "A" to "J" "sharp" (#) notes of lower Octave
 From "Q" to "U" notes of higher Octave
 From "1" to "7" "sharp" (#) notes of higher Octave

 So used the ~keys ~as ~described ~above to write notes... nothing will happen though
 if ~you ~don't ~activate ~Editing ~mode. ~Usually ~it's ~just ~enought ~to ~press ~spacebar to
 activate it and press it again to deactivate ~it. To ~verify ~if ~you're ~in ~Editing ~or ~not
 you can see (for example on FastTracker2) if the screen borders are grey~~~(Active)
 or black (Passiv... errr... Deactive).

 Good. Now I leave you in peace to let you take first steps...

 R O N F . . . R O N F . . . R O N F . . . R O N F . .

 Ehm....~~~eh? You already tried?~~~~Want other notions?~~~~damm, not even the time to take
 a nap... oh well, let's go on....

 Once ~this ~~part ~~is ~~over ~~you ~~would ~~start ~~using ~~some ~more ~~effect, ~to ~~make ~~your
 experiments as ~closer ~to ~a ~real ~song ~as ~possible. Here's the list of most common
  ~effects which you can find and use on a tracker:

 1 - Portamento UP                            9 - Play with Offset
 2 - Portamento DOWN                        A - Volume Slide
 3 - Portamento TO NOTE                      B - Jump to Pattern
 4 - Vibrato                                  C - Volume
 5 - Portamento TO NOTA + Volume Slide        D - Pattern Break
 6 - Vibrato + Volume Slide                    ~~~E - Secondary Effects
 7 - Tremolo                                  F - Speed (Speed + Tempo)
 8 - Unused

 Watch out~~~-~~~The order~~~~I~~~~chose to~~~~~show you their functioning won't~~~~~be~~~~the numerical
 one, rather the best one for a linear and simpler comprehension.

 What's ~all ~this ~stuff ? Well ~it's surely way interesting, but you're gonna see... Try
 to read ~and ~learn ~the ~following rows ~and ~maybe try them ~on ~the ~tracker. Not ~all
 ~of them are so easy to use, so you should better ~start with simpler ones, volume
 controls related ones for instance. Here's the most common effects in detail:

 = = = = =
 # 1 - Portamento UP (*)

 Syntax: Values ranging from 100 to 1FF. Applies both with and without a note.
 Description: ~Acts ~on ~note ~tone, ~increasing ~it ~of ~a ~bit ~(depending ~on ~~the ~intensity
  you decide to apply, from ~00 ~(nothing) ~~to ~FF) ~with ~a ~Slide ~~effect. ~Timespan ~of ~a
 slide will always be within a second (even if intensity is FF...)
 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_1.raw°64°241°100°
 = = = = =
 ~# 2 - Portamento DOWN (*)

 Syntax: Values ~ranging ~from ~200 to 2FF. Applies both with and without a note.
 Description: Acts like Portamento UP, just in the opposite way.
 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_2.raw°64°300°70°
 You can see ~on ~the ~example ~that you can use it also on an already played note.
 (repetition~~~~~to~~~~avoid misunderstandings,~~~~see SYNTAX) Obviously if note sounds stops
 on row 01, we're not gonna listen any slide... :)

 = = = = =
 # 3 - Portamento TO NOTA (*)

 ~Syntax: Values ~ranging from 300 to 3FF. Doesn't apply in presence of played note.
 Description: Another effect which acts on note ~tone, this time in a more ~intelligent
  and sofisticated way. Firstly you need to write ~the ~note ~toward ~which ~you ~want
 to ~bring ~the ~~tone ~of ~the ~~played ~note. Then ~you ~need ~to ~specify ~the ~speed ~with
 which  that ~note  has ~to ~~be  reached. ~This ~~allows ~~both ~~making  ~~highly  precise
 Portamentos and to decide Slide dynamic,which means you can either make it slow
 and ~very ~slide ~or ~quick, or ~even ~mostly ~unhearable, ~similar ~to ~an ~Acciaccatura, or
 Hammering. It could happen that the value you chose is too low ~and that it is not
 possible ~to ~reach ~the ~desired ~note. ~Try ~to ~believe. ~But ~let's ~have ~some ~examples
 for this effect which should be understood in the detail:
 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_3.raw°128°432°10°
Example1: In this case D-2 notes gets reached with a full slide effect...

 Example 2: ~As ~~you ~~can ~~see ~~you ~~can ~~place ~the ~effect ~on ~several ~rows ~without
 having ~to ~repeat ~the ~same note if the lines are ~in ~succession. Note ~gets reached
 in this case also, but with a slower and loger slide...

 Example3 : The example above could also be written like this...~~Total intensity is still
 "09", since in ~case ~there ~is ~the ~effect ~3 ~without ~intensity (00) ~the ~last one gets
  used if different from 0. This one's hard, isn't it? :)
 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_4.raw°128°287°80° Example4: Note gets reached quickly and results as an hammering.

 Example5: Ui!~~~~To pretend to reach C in the higher octave with just~~~~"09"~~~~as~~~~intensity
 it's a little of an illusion... 8^) Try with an intensity of at least "20".

 Note: If ~~writing ~a ~note ~(the ~~tone ~~destination ~~one) ~~you ~~erase ~~the ~number ~of ~the
 instrument (which in this case  was 10...) there is another Feature, which lets you
 keep the volume of the previous note. Let's see another example:
 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_5.raw°112°340°50°
  In This case note volume is~~~~"kept"~~~~to 22,~~~~~otherwise it would have been reset~~~~to~~~~40.

 = = = = =
 # 4 - VIBRATO

 Syntax: Speed - ranging from 40x to 4Fx. Intensity - ranging from 4x0 to 4xF.
 ~       Applies both with and without a note.
 Description: Effect ~which ~acts, even ~if more ~sensitively ~than ~others, on ~note ~tone
 (so on instrument frequency). You probably already know the Vibrato effect,~~~~~so I'm
 going straight to the examples.

 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_6.raw°96°149°150°
 Simple ~example ~of ~a ~Vibrato ~effect ~of ~medium ~speed (7) ~and pretty ~low ~intensity
 (3) (you ~can ~barely hear ~it...). As ~you ~can ~see you can ~write the ~note ~just once
 and ~then repeat ~the ~4 ~as ~long ~as ~you ~want ~it ~to last. To ~be clear: in ~this~ case
 effect starts from row 2 and stops on row 5.

 = = = = =
 # 7 - TREMOLO

  Syntax: Speed - ranging from 70x to 7Fx. Intensity - ranging from 7x0 to 7xF.
 ~       Applies both with and without a note.
 ~Description: Usage ~is just the same as Vibrato, but it works on Volume instead of
 Tone. Obvious!
 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_7.raw°96°154°150°

 Nothing to say, it's just like before...

 = = = = =
 # 8 - Unused

 = = = = =
 # 9 - Play with OFF-SET
~
 ~Syntax: Applies with note only.
 Description: This ~effect ~is very ~particoular. ~Someone think it's useless while others
 have fune using it for the casualty ~of the results...~~~~:I Good. It means that the note
 doesn't get played from its beginning, but a little further.

  °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_8.raw°208°431°10°

   oo ~~@ Point from which it gets played
   oo
   oo
   oo - unplayed part


 Note gets played after ~the ~"real" ~beginning. As ~if ~~someone ~~cut ~~a ~~tiny ~~bit ~of ~~the
 wave. The Timbre of the instrument gets sensitively changed.

 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_9.raw°208°436°10°

   ~~~~o                                            ~~~~@  Point from which
   ~~~~o                                             ~o  it gets played
   ~~~~~|~~~ o o o o o o    Unplayed  Part    o o o o o o~ |


 Still another timbre variation, and huge this time around...

 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_10.raw°176°419°10°                                                                @
                                          ~~Point from which we try to play it
 If~~~~the instrument has~~~~a~~~~~short duration ed the offset value is too high,~~~then probably
 we ~are ~not ~gonna ~listen ~anything (wanna ~try ~playing ~an ~instrument after it's ~end
 anyone?)
 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_11.raw°112°313°10°
-
 ~Just like ~effect 3, if ~there ~is ~"00" ~set ~instead ~of ~instrument~ number ~the ~note will
 be played at the same volume of the previous one. In this case "2A".

 = = = = =
 # A - VOLUME Slide (*)

 Syntax: ~~~~Intensity Increment - values ranging from A0x to AFx.
         Intensity Decrement - values ranging from Ax0 to AxF.
 ~       ~~~Applies both with and without a note.
 ~Description: ~~Pretty ~~good. ~~This ~~is ~~a ~~very ~~nice ~~effect. What ~~does ~this ~~effect ~do?
 Simple ~~and ~~nice. ~Increments ~~or ~~decrements ~~volume (~see ~~SYNTAX) ~~based ~~on ~~the
 applied intensity.

 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_12.raw°128°306°65°
Example1: ~Volume ~gets ~lowered ~from ~"40" ~(remind ~you ~that... ~if ~there's ~nothing ~~on
 the side of note it the maximum/original volume is applied) to about "10" and pretty
  drastically. If ~the ~instrument ~is ~longer ~enough ~it ~an ~effect ~similar ~to ~the ~"reeverb"
 ~could come out of it...

 Example2: ~Volume ~gets ~drastically ~set to zero! Note: (to be read after the ~reading
 of "C" effect workings)

 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_13.raw°128°306°60°
So. This ~is~ a ~delicate ~point. ~Apparently ~the results ~of ~this ~comparation ~~might ~look
 identical, ~~because ~~~with ~~both ~~~methods ~~you ~~~get ~~~to ~~a ~~~final ~~volume ~~of ~"10". That's
 ~partially true, ~but ~while ~with ~"C" ~effect ~the ~volume ~gets ~immediatly switched from
 40 to 10 (with a clear and not so nice break), with "A" ~effect ~all ~the intermediate
 values between the "initial" volume and the one "to be reatched" get played,~~~~which
 a ~consequent ~high ~sense~ of ~softness ~and ~fluidness. In ~this ~case it can be ~called
 Volume Fade.

 = = = = =
 # B - Pattern JUMP

  Syntax: Applies both with and without a note.
 Description: ~~Page ~~Jump. It's ~~just ~~used ~~to ~~jump ~to ~~another ~~pattern ~~in ~~the ~~sorted
 sequence. Just like Pattern Break, ~the ~row on ~which ~the ~effect is located ~it's the
 last to be played.

 = = = = =
 # C - VOLUME
 ~
 ~Syntax: Values ~ranging ~from ~~C00 ~to ~~C40. ~Applies ~~both ~with ~and ~without ~a ~note.
 Description:~~~~This surely~~~~~is the~~~~~main command and also the most used one.~~~~64 levels
 of volume (I~~~~~remind you that numbers are hexadecimal,~~~~so 40H) are for the moment
 the maximum that a tracker can offer and I gotta say it ain't bad at all!~~~The usage
 of the effect it's very simple and can be resumed with a single example.

 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_14.raw°96°146°150°

 Simple: ~note ~C-2 ~has ~volume ~40. ~Note ~D-3 ~has ~volume ~zero (but ~then ~again ~why
 the hell did I write it?!?). Note A-4 has volume 0E (14 in decimal...)
 ~
  = = = = =
 # D - Pattern Break

 Syntax: Just write D00...!
 Description:~~~~Pattern~~~~~Interruption.~~~~It jumps straight~~~~on~~~~the~~~~next~~~~pattern~~~~in~~~~the sequence.
 Very clear! Note. The line on which the D effect is on gets played aswell.

 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_15.raw°96°140°150°

 The~~~~pattern gets played until row 05~~~(INCLUDED)~~~and then jumps~~~~on~~~~the~~~~next~~~~pattern
 ~in sequence.

 = = = = =
 # Ex - Various Secondary Effects

 I wouldn't spend lot of time, at least for ~this ~time, ~to ~stop ~on ~these ~effects: less
 importance, bigger complexity... (!)

 = = = = =
  # F - Speed & Tempo

 Syntax:
  Speed: values ranging from F00 to F1F (the smaller, the quicker).
  Tempo: values ranging from F20 to FFF (the smaller, the slower).
 Description: Tempo, by default, is "7D" (125 in decimal).~~~(default = if nobody has yet
 set a value,~~~~this values gets auto setted,~~~~hence the default...).~~~Default speed is "06"
 ~
 So... a little definition of Speed and Tempo just ~to ~diversificate ~them: Speed ~is ~the
 base speed of the song, while Tempo is the speed in detail... In other words,~~~~while
 speed has just "32" possible values on the speed scale, from ~minimum to maximum
 possible, tempo has "224" of ~them. This ~lets ~you ~understand that even ~a ~variation
 of~~~~~1 in the speed could be way more relevant than one of the tempo...~~~~ok,~~~~but let's
 see a... what ?? .. an example, of course!

 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_16.raw°128°349°50°

  "3" degrees increment of SPEED "3" degrees of TEMPO.

 As you can see the ~increment ~is ~just the same, but while in the former case the
 speed on row 04 doubles, in the latter gets just increased a lot.

 = = = = =
 # 5 - Portamento TO NOTE + VOLUME Slide (*)

 Syntax: ~~~~Intensity Increment - values ranging from 50x to 5Fx.
         Intensity Decrement - values ranging from 5x0 to 5xF.
         Applies both with and without a note.
         Has to be used after the usage of effect "3".
 Description:~~~~So...~~~this effect,~~~as well as the next one you're going to see,~~~has mainly
 born as a composer need,~~~~~which having just a single column of effect wasn't able
 to execute~~~~a~~~~one tone slide together with~~~~a~~~~volume fade.~~~talkin cheaper you couldn't
 lower the volume of a note while you are already modifying it with the~~~~portamento
 ~effect. ~Here, ~this ~~effect ~~ties ~two ~~effects ~~together, ~the ~"3" ~and ~~the ~"A". ~Do ~~you
 remind ~what ~this ~two ~~effects ~do ? ~3 ~is ~~the ~~Portamento ~to ~~Note, A ~is ~~the ~way
 sofisticated Volume Slide. Here comes the effect "5" which uses the intensity with
 the same dynamic as in effect A,~~~~while at the same time~~~~~it makes a~~~~Portamento to
 the ~chosen ~note ~with ~the ~last ~used ~3 ~effect. For ~this reason in the SYNTAX it's
 written that~~~~it~~~~MUST~~~~be~~~~~used after the effect 3,~~~otherwise effect 5 has~~~no~~~meaning...
 let's see:

-
 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_17.raw°128°351°50°

 ~Example 1: This is an ~ipotetical ~case of a ~two columns track for the effects. Note
 E-2 gets slided through ~toward the E-1 note with the Slide "3" effect, and on row
 05~~~~it~~~~gets topped~~~~by~~~~the fade effect which~~~~is~~~~mild~~~~in~~~~the~~~~beginning,~~~~and gets stronger
 in the following lines while the 3 effect continues what it was doing~~~~(I remind you
 that~~~~in~~~~this case 300~~~~is~~~~~the same as saying 30A).~~~~We know anyway that we can't
 have two effects column on a common tracker.

 Example2: With the 5 effect we do the same thing ~using ~a ~single ~effects ~column.
 The 3 effect conginues with the same intensity ~as ~the ~one ~on ~the ~last ~used ~line
 (3A) ~while ~the ~~intensity ~~of ~~the ~~volume ~~effect ~~gets ~~written ~~near ~~the ~~5 ~~and ~~it's
 dynamic ~it's, as ~already ~stated, the ~same ~as ~in effect "A". Impossible ~to ~explain it
 better this!


  = = = = =
 # 6 - Vibrato + VOLUME Slide (*)
 ~
 ~Syntax: ~~~~Intensity Increment - values ranging from 60x to 60F.
         Intensity Decrement - values ranging from 6x0 to 6xF.
         Applies both with and without a note.
         Has to be used after the usage of effect "4".
 Description: Nothing much ~to ~say ~about this. Did ~you ~understand ~how ~the ~previos
 effect works?~~~Good.~~~This does the same but instead of Portamento to Note,~~~~it does
 it with the Vibrato.

 °PROGDIR:data/articles/coding4/track_2_18.raw°96°147°150°

 ~Vibrato effect starts at row 02. At row 05 the volume ~starts ~decreasing (still like
 effect A) while at the same time the Vibrato effect goes on. Very simple!!

 = = = = =
 (*) - VERY IMPORTANT

  All ~~the ~~effects ~~marked ~~with ~~a ~~(*) ~~have ~~a ~~different ~~rendering ~~depending ~~on ~the
 pattern ~scan ~speed (F)... Example: ~A ~Portamento ~Up ~effect ~of ~102 ~with ~Speed ~06
 will have the same effect as one of 104 with speed of 03.

 In ~other ~words doubling ~SPEED (be it ~Speed ~or~ Tempo) ~you ~have ~the intensity of
 the ~used ~effect. ~Everything ~clear ? ~In ~case ~of this ~lesson ~the ~effects have been
 tested with a Standard Speed, (Speed=6 and Tempo=7D)

 Pheeeeww.. anf.. anf..~~~~let me cut myself some slack. I hope this stuff will keep you
 busy for a while. before having some good knowledge about ~all ~these ~effects and
 the usage~~~~of~~~FastTracker2 some time will certainly pass,~~~~so I believe that~~~~I~~~~will have
 ~some time to rest.. so wish me a Good Night, while I wish you:

 HAPPY WRITING !!!
