  In the computer scene,~~starting ~with ~the ~8-bit lightyears ago and finishing with the
 scene of today,~~the rule most often used was: Pictures ~were ~and ~are not allowed
 if ~they ~were ~redrawn or ~based on ~scanned motifs. The ~same ~applied ~to ~modules,
 which were not allowed to carry the ~melody of other musicians. Sadly, at present,
 it ~~sometimes ~~occurs ~~that ~~these ~~"adaptational" ~~works ~do ~occupy ~one of ~the ~first
 places~~~~at~~~~gfx compos at PC parties. It usually occurs when organizations~~~~don't~~~have
 any ~knowledge ~of ~the ~origination ~of ~the ~work or do not care. But it does happen
 more and more often.

 I ~do ~not ~intend ~to ~focus ~this text ~on ~the ~negative ~affects ~of ~copied ~or ~redrawn
 pictures of ~characters at ~parties ~and ~the ~whole ~scene. I ~don't ~have ~any ~purpose
 counting each ~sin ~of ~known ~pixel ~artists on this field. The ~webmaster ~of ~the ~site
 "No Copy?" already does that perfectly. Visit http://www.kameli.net/nocopy/~~~for~~~more
 info. Instead I will focus on plagiarism and how to avoid it, and the ~steps ~involved
 to be a scene related painter.

 The ~truth is that good painting techniques are not necessary ~for scanning and re-
 touching. ~Instead, ~you ~must ~have ~the ~right ~software ~apps ~and ~a ~~good ~sense ~for
 colour ~and ~composition. ~But ~you ~~either ~have ~this ~sense ~or ~not. You ~cannot ~learn
 it.~~~And how does this career begin? The best choice would be to have a ~personal
 teacher.~~Otherwise, the ~best ~starting ~point is ~learning how to repaint on your own
 This constitutes a great form of training.

 ~If~~the~~~painter has talent, usually~~~he~~~gets better and better with his copies. And with
  the rising quality his degree of improvement grows and grows.~~Sooner or later he's
 able to get a good position in a gfx compo at a demo party.

 What~~~~I~~~want to point out is that to make copies of originals should be only a form
 of ~training. ~Not ~more, ~~not ~~less. ~I ~advise ~~everybody ~not ~~to ~~present ~any ~~of ~~these
 plagiarisms  at any ~~~~competitions. ~If ~~you ~~want ~~to ~~be ~~a ~~good  graphician, ~prepare
 yourself ~for ~more ~devotion than ~only to work around eight ~hours on a ~plain copy.
 Beginners could train themselves by ~accomplishing modifications. It is a good, if not
 the best, way to ~get ~away ~from the copy. Draw what you have in your ~brain, ~in
 your memory, not from an original.~~~And if you use the same figure,~~you ~~could ~show
 it in a different pose.

 For lovers of realistic paintings, the key is to repaint from ~nature, etc. In this case
 you cannot speak of any plagiarism. Works in this style would not ~be ~accused by
 anybody. ~The ~mouse ~as ~a ~painting ~device ~itself ~is indeed a very unhandy one. To
 ~draw an object with its correct property, etc.,~~pen & paper is a lot easier.~~~~~Working
 with ~~electronic ~~devices, ~such ~~as ~~montor, ~keyboard, ~etc. ~make ~it ~harder ~to ~create
 something ~~with ~~sense, ~as ~~they ~are ~less ~~direct. ~~Xenusion ~of ~Plastic, ~for ~~example,
 only ~works ~with ~his ~graphics ~tablet, ~he ~never ~uses his ~mouse in ~order to ~create
 pictures. But that, of course, is a matter of taste.

 Drawings that have been ~not drawn by the author himself from scratch should be
 deleted ~from ~any ~compo. ~If ~you ~have ~problems ~with ~fullscreen ~pictures, you could
 start ~by painting ~some ~small ~cliparts, ~perhaps ~for ~a ~diskmag. Of ~course it is a lot
  more ~~work ~to ~~draw ~~something ~~like ~~the ~muscles ~~of ~an ~~animal ~~yourself, ~than ~just
 using ~a ~~picture. Noogman ~of ~~Scoopex ~~told ~~me ~that ~he ~studied ~a ~book ~about ~the
 anatomy of ~animals ~in ~order to be able to~ paint ~which ~exact ~muscles ~of ~a ~horse
 are ~~used ~in ~~which ~pose, ~and ~which ~are ~not. ~This ~is ~plain, ~~hard ~work, of ~course.

 ~But Scene means~~~~a lot of work and not easy fame by abusing the~~~100.000~~~~possible
  alternating ~menus ~of ~Photoshop ~and ~other ~tools. ~The ~good ~thing is ~that there are
 still graphicians that~~~~work~~~~with Amiga tools.~~~In that case, it's not possible~~~~~to~~~~choose
 the evil and quick way.

 The~~~~bad~~~~news is that more and more people even~~~~don't~~~~know anymore about these
 basic rules,~~~and that compo organizations seem to care less and less about people
 who only clone and vary.
