 |                                                                          |

 | First,you must make sure that you have 640x480x8 (RTG) or 640x512x8(AGA) |
 | screen modes in your screen mode preferences.If you run diskmag with 'no |
 | s-s' on classic Amigas, then you must run SetPatch first,because,if this |
 | is NOT done, you will only have ECS (64colors)  modes, and  AGA will  be |
 | impossible for you. So, for those with 'no s-s', SetPatch is a must.     |
 |                                                                          |
 | Also,for a better-looking first option picture,it is best to setup WB to |
 | 256 colours or more. It will still work, even  with WB set to  4 colours |
 | (for example with 'no s-s' screen,) but it will,in fact,look a bit ugly, |
 | with the remapping of palette base on WB screen colours. So, if you want |
 | a better overall look for your options window,just set WB to 256 colours |
 | For the diskmag engine itself, all of this does not matter; it uses it's |
 | own palettes.                                                            |
 |                                                                          |
 | The engine must be run AFTER COLD REBOOT  because  AOS3  does  not  have |
 | memory protection. Many other  applications can affect the  memory, some |
 | very important pieces of  code can  possibly be  over-written, and these |
 | things will create problems for diskmag usage. This kind of problem that |
 | occurs without MP cannot be detected 'as is', and you will see a strange |
 | crash/ halt/ guru message after some time :) So, reboot is MUST.         |
 |                                                                          |
 | Classic users need the CORRECT ahi version. If you experience slowdowns, |
 | you must update your ahi version to 6.0 or later. With 4.x (for example) |
 | you will most likely experience slowdowns. Also, what was found with one |
 | tester's machine: after running  diskmag  over  ahi, the  music  playing |
 | stopped/froze after a few seconds. This  problem  is  simply  solved  by |
 | increasing the number of channels.                                       |
 |                                                                          |
 | If you do not hear sound after choosing 'ahi: fx + sounds', you  need to |
 | increase channels number in the ahi preferences on  your unit. You  will |
 | always need more than 1, the minimum is 2: One for music  and the second |
 | one for sound events.                                                    |
 |                                                                          |
 | Users on  A1/Pegasos can also use this edition, but 256 colours is a bit |
 | ungainly if compared to the Warp3D version;here one will find 24bit data,|
 | fast and smooth pixel scrolling, and some 2D effects,which do not have a |
 | place in the aga-rtg edition on account of  their  obvious  limitations. |
 | However, users with modern Amigas can (must) enjoy the Warp3D edition.   |
