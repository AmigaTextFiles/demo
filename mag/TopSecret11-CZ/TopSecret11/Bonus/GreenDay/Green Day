@node ATT "At The Library"

Hey there lookin' at me
Tell me what do you see
But you quickly turn your head away
Try to find the words I could use
Don't have the courage to come up to you
My chance is looking a bit grey

Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time

What is it that drives me mad
Girls like you that I never had
What is it about you that I adore?
What makes me go so insane
That makes me feel so much pain
What is it about you that I adore?

Starting across the room
Are you leaving soon?
I just need a little time

Why did you have to leave so soon?
Why did you have to walk away?
Oh well it happened again
She walked away with her boyfriend
Maybe we'll meet again someday.
@endnode

@node DON "Don't Leave Me"

I'll go for miles
Till I find you
You say you want to leave me
But you can't choose
I've gone thru pain
Every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane
Something I can't fight

Don't leave me
Don't leave me

A blank expression
Covering your face
I'm looking for directions
For out of this place
I start to wonder
If you'll come back
I feel the rain storming after thunder
I can't hold back

Don't leave me

I'll go for miles
Till I find you
You say you want to leave me
But you can't choose
I've gone thru pain
Every day and night
I feel my mind is going insane
Something I can't fight

Don't leave me
@endnode

@node IWA "I Was There"

Looking back upon my life
And the places that I've been
Pictures, faces, girls I've loved
I try to remember when
Faded memories on the wall
Some names I have forgotten
But each one is a memory I
Look back on so often.

I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there

I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there

Looking back what I have done
There's lots more life to live
At times I feel overwhelmed
I question what I can give
But I don't let it get me down
Or cause me too much sorrow
There's no doubt about who I am
I always have tomorrow

I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there

I look into the past
I want to make it last
I was there

Looking back upon my life
Faded memories on the wall
Looking now at who I am
I don't let it get me down.

Looking back upon my life

@node DIS "Disappearing Boy"

Now you see me, now you don't
Don't ask me where I'm at
'Cause I'm a million miles away
Treated like a forbidden heel
Don't say my thoughts are not for real
Or you won't see me again

Am I here or am I there
Or am I playing on the stairs
Am I in my room with my toys
I am the disappearing boy

When I walk in crowded rooms
I feel as if it is my doom
I know that I don't belong
In that room I see her
I see her and she's with him
I turn and then I'm gone

Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home
My whereabouts are now unknown
I vanished from all your joy
I'm the disappearing boy

I have my doubts
Of where I belong
It's something to think about

Don't call me up 'cause I'm not home
My whereabouts are now unknown
I vanished from all your joy
I'm the disappearing boy

@node GRE "Green Day"

A small cloud has fallen
The white mist hits the ground
My lungs comfort me with joy
Vegging on one detail
The rest just crowds around
My eyes itch of burning red

Picture sounds
Of moving insects so surreal
Lay around
Looks like I found something new

Laying in my bed
I think I'm in left field
I picture someone, I think it's you
You're standing so damn close
My body begins to swell
Why does 1 + 1 make 2

@node GOI "Going to Pasalacqua"

Here we go again, infatuation
Touches me just when I
Thought that it would end
Oh but then again it seems
Much more than that but
I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking

Well,I toss and turn all night
Thinking of your ways of effection
But to find that it's not different at all
I throw away my past mistakes
And contemplate my future
That's when I say...
What the hey!

Would I last forever?
You and I together, hand and hand
We run away (far away)
I'm in for nasty weather
But I'll take whatever you can
give that comes my way (far away)

Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are these problems just in my mind?
Things are easy when you're a child
But now these pressures have dropped on my head
The length I've gone are just long miles
Would they be shorter if I were dead

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair

Look at my friends and see what they've done
Ask myself why they had to change
I like them better when they were young
Now all these times are rearranged
I look down and stand there and cry
Nothing ever will be the same
The sun is rising, now I ask why?
The clouds now fall and here comes the rain

Every time I look in my past
I always wish I was there
I wish my youth would forever last
Why are these times so unfair

Every night I dream the same dream
Of getting older all the time
I ask you now, what does this mean?
Are these problems just in my mind?

I'll never do exactly what I want
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance

What the next man thinks of me
I'll never do exactly what I want

And I feel forgotten
Feel like rotting
(Do you feel the same?)
(Do you feel the same?)
Adolescence
Just can't make sense
(It's calling my name)

I take a look around
And all the things I've found
I call it blind hatred
If you'd stop a while
And maybe if you'd smile
You would realize that
We're all the same

It's just like our brain
When it apes insane
We feel the same pain

All my life I've seemed to have this need
I think at times it even turns to greed
We all want to join some family
We'll even sacrifice a moral changing

To have changed

Princess in a school girl's dream
May I please speak with you?
I'm having troubles with control
And it's all because of you
Today I kept on falling down
I thought it was the street
So I look down at my shoes
They were on the wrong feet

I find it hard to be myself
(Can you please explain?)
I do not think that it's my health
(You're the one to blame)
You're the one I wish I had
And now my girlfriend is getting mad
(I cannot call this sane)

Today as I was walking down
You bumped into me
You said "excuse me" and walked away
As I dropped to my knees
I prayed to the being in the sky
That my parents told me of
I asked about you but no reply
No clues about your love!

I find it hard to be myself
(Can you please explain?)
I do not think that it's my health
(You're the one to blame)
My girlfriend left me on the phone
I'm pathetically left here alone
(I cannot call this sane)

Can we find a way
So that you can stay
I think I'm gonna Pop

Now I rest my head from
Such an endless dreary time
A time of hopes and happiness
That had you on my mind
Those days are gone and now it seems
As if I'll get some rest
But now and then I'll see you again
And it puts my heart to the test

So when are all my problems going to end?
I'm understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you

As the days go on I wonder
(Will this ever end?)
I find it hard to keep control
When you're with your boyrfriend
I do not mind if all I am is
Just a friend to you
But all I want to know right now
Is if you think about me too... ?

So when are all my problems going to end?
I'm understanding now that
We are only friends
To this day I'm asking why
I still think about you

@node WHY "Why do you Want Him?"

I saw you standing alone
With a sad look on your face
You call him on the phone
Looks like he left you
Without a trace
Tears falling out of your eyes
He's living in a disguise
You've been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it's right or wrong

Why Do You Want Him?
Why Do You Want Him?

Now many days have gone by
And you still just sit there and cry
You're feeling bad for yourself
His memory will always dwell
You're so obsessed with his love
That's why push came to shove
You've been feeling bad for so long
You wonder if it's right or wrong

Why Do You Want Him?
Why Do You Want Him?

Why Do You Want Him?
Why Do You Want Him?

You find a way out...
To throw it all the way
But you can bet...
You got someting to say

@node 409 "409 in Your Coffeemaker"

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted
In a daze

It should seem obvious to you
Your screams and cries are never going to work
And all of your time gets wasted
In my daze

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break from these chains
These chains that control
My future's aim...

I sit in the state of a daydream
With all of your words flying over my head
Even more time gets wasted
In a daze

Maybe I'm just too damn lazy
Or maybe I was just brainwashed to think that way
And all of your time gets wasted
In my daze

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break from these chains
These chains that control
My future's aim...

I'm looking-
   back now at-
Where I have-
   have gone wrong...
And why I -
   could not seem-
Could not seem-
   to get along...

And I'm looking back now
At where I have gone wrong
And why I could not seem to get along
My interests are longing
To break from these chains
These chains that control
My future's aim...

@node KNO "Knowledge"

I know that things are getting tougher
When you can't get the top off from
  the bottom of the barrel,
Wide open road of my future now...
It's looking fucking narrow.

All I know is that I don't know nothing.
We get told to decide.
Just like as if I'm not going to change my mind.

All I know is that I don't know nothing.
Whatcha gonna do with yourself,
Boy better make up your mind...

Whatcha gonna do with yourself boy,
You're running out of time.

This time I got it all figured out:
All I know is that I don't know nothing...
And that's fine.

@node 100 "1,000 Hours"

Starlit night
The moon is shining bright
You are the one I need
Up at your window
I see a shadow
Silhouette of your grace
Here's this flower
I picked for all the hours
That you've spent with me
The one I love
That I've been dreaming of
Sailing across the sea

Let my hands flow through
Your hair.  Moving closer
A kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong

Nothing's more
Than what our love is for
As I kiss your cheek
Oh so softly
Hands flowing down my back
1,000 hours, I'll never leave
Our romance
Is a love trance
And now we'll never part
1,000 hours
Of such a love shower
We'll never stop, once we start

Let my hands flow through
Your hair.  Moving closer
A kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong

Let my hands flow through
Your hair.  Moving closer
A kiss we'll share
Passionate love to be all night long
We'll never break, as one too strong

@node DRY "Dry Ice"

Late last night I had a dream
And she was in it again
She and I were in the sky
Flying hand in hand
I woke up in a cold sweat
Wishing she was by my side
Praying that she'll dry tears
Left on my face I've cried

Oh I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend

I'll send a letter to that girl
Asking her to by my own
But my pen is writing wrong
So I'll say it in a song
Oh I love you more right now
More than I've ever loved before
Here's those words straight from these lips
I'll need you forever more.

Oh I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend

Oh I love her
Keep dreaming of her
Will I understand
If she wants to be my friend

The means of pain thats in my heart...
The means of pain thats in my heart...
The means of pain thats in my heart...

@node ONL "Only of You"

I wish I could tell you
But the words would come out wrong
Oh if you only knew
The way I felt for so long
I know that we're worlds apart
But I just don't seem to care
These feelings in my heart
Only with you I want to share

The first time I caught a glimpse of you
Then my thoughts were only of you

I hope that when time goes by
You will think the same about me
Many nights awake I lie
I only wish that you could see
I know that we're only friends
I hope this feeling never ends
If I could only hold you
It's the only thing I want to do.

The first time I caught a glimpse of you
Then my thoughts were only of you

@node THE "The One I Want"

Sitting in my room last night
Staring at the mirror
I couldn't find a reason why
I couldn't be near her

'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you'd say

Pictures going through my mind
When we're together
All these long and sleepless nights
Will I ever get better

'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you'd say
'Cause you are THE ONE THAT I WANT

Now you know how I feel
This love is forever
You make my life seem so unreal
Will I ever get better? ...

'Cause you are the one that started
To make me feel this way
And every night I'm thinking
About the words you'd say
'Cause you are THE ONE THAT I WANT

@node 200 "2,000 Light Years Away"

I sit alone in my bedroom
Staring at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speeding
My love is yearning

I hold my breath and close my eyes and...
Dream about her
Cause she's 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so...
Never let go
Cause she's 2000 light years away
Years Away!

I sit outside and watch the sunrise
Lookout as far as I can
I can't see her, but in the distance
I hear some laughter,
We laugh together
 
I hold my breath and close my eyes and...
Dream about her
Cause she's 2000 light years away
She holds my malakite so tight so...
Never let go
Cause she's 2000 light years away

Juliet's trying to find out what she wants, but she don't know
Experience has got her down
Look this direction, I know it's not perfection, it's just me...
I want to bring you up again now

Cause' I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price to pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

Juliet's crying cause now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy, and a bit lazy
But I will try to bring you up again now

@node PAR "Welcome to Paradise"

Dear mother,
Can you hear me whining?
It's been three whole weeks
Since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feeling so alone

Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it the slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through
a wasteland I like to call
my home
Welcome To Paradise

A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through
a wasteland I like to call

Welcome To Paradise

Dear mother,
Can you hear me laughing
It's been six whole months since
Since that I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

@node CHR "Christie Road"

Staring out of my window
Watching the cars go rolling by
My friends are gone
I've got nothing to do
So I sit here patiently
Watching the clock tick so slowly
Gotta get away
Or my brains will explode

Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

See the hills from afar
Standing on my beat up car
The sun went down and the night fills the sky
Now I feel like me once again
As the train comes rolling in
Smoked my boredom gone
Slapped my brains up so high

Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road

Mother stay out of my way of that place we go
We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road

If there's one thing that I need
That makes me feel complete
So I go to Christie Road
It's home...

@node PRI "Private Ale"

I wonder down these streets all by myself
Think of my future now
I just don't know
I don't seem to care
I stop to notice that
I'm by your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there

Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sight
And through my veins temptation flows
Whoa hoa...
Out here...

So I sit down here on the hard concrete
Think of my future now
I just don't know
I don't seem to care
So I sit across the street from your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there

Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sight
And through my veins temptation flows
Whoa hoa...
Out here...

@node DOM "Dominated Love Slave"

I want to be your dominated love slave
I want to be the one that takes the pain
You can spank me when I do not behave

Smack me in the forehead with a chain
Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive them staples deep

I want you to slap me and call me naughty
Put a beltsander against my skin
I want to feel pain all over my body
Can't wait to be punished for my sins.

Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive them staples deep

Yee-hah!

Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap

@node LIE "One of My Lies"

When I was younger I thought the world circled around me
But in time I realized I was wrong
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
It was a tragic case of my reality

Do you think you're indestructable
And no one can touch you
Well I think you're disposeable
And it's time you knew the truth...

Cause it's just one of my lies!
Well, its just its just one of my lies
And all I wanted to was get real high
Well, its just its just one of my lies

Why does my life have to be so small?
Yet death is forever
And does forever have a life to call its own?
Don't give me an answer cause you
Only know as much as I know
Unless you're been there once
Well I hardly think so

Do you think you're indestructable
And no one can touch you
Well I think you're disposeable
And it's time you knew the truth...

Cause it's just one of my lies!
Well, its just its just one of my lies
And all I wanted to was get real high
Well, its just its just one of my lies

I used to pray all night
Before I lay myself down
My mother said it was right
Her mother said it too...
Why?

@node 80 "80"

My mental stability reaches its bitter end
And all my senses are coming unglued
Is there any cure for this disease someone called love
Not as long as there are girls like you

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just can't trust myself

If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall

Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone
And lock myself up in a padded room
I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air
No one wants to hear a drunken fool

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just can't trust myself

If anyone can hear me slap some sense into me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I loose my head or I bang it up against the wall

I do not mind if this goes on
Cause now it seems I'm too far gone
I must admit I enjoy myself
80 please keep taking me away

Everything she does questions my mental health

@node AND "Android"

Hey old man in woman's shoes
I wonder if he knows I think he's crazy
When he was young did he have dreams
Of wearing woman's shoes and being crazy?

It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change

Or will I grow that old?
Will I still be around?
The way I carry on I'll end up
Six feet underground
And waste away...

When the old man was in school
Did the golden rule make him go crazy
Or did he hide away from hopes
Behind a smile and smoking dope
It's crazy

It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change

Or will I grow that old?
Will I still be around?
The way I carry on I'll end up
Six feet underground
And waste away...

It seems so frightening
Time passes by like lightning
Before you know it you're struck down
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around
And waste away...

@node NOO "No One Knows"

Why should my fun have to end?
For me it's only the beginning
I see my friends begin to age
A short countdown to what end

Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes
Better think again
Cause no one knows

I don't want to cause no harm
But sometimes my actions hurt
Is there something I should find
To make plans for forever

Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes
Better think again
Cause no one knows

Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
But when you think of me

You soak up knowledge to fill the space

@node WRO "Who Wrote Holden Caulfield?"

A thought burst in my head and I need to tell you
It's news that I for thought
Was it just a dream that happened long ago?
I think that I just forgot

Well it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad

There's a boy who fogs his world and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand but always ends up sitting.
Someone help him up or he's gonna end up quitting

I shuffle through my mind
To see if I can find
The words I left behind
Was it just a dream that happened long ago?
Oh well...
Never mind.

Well it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad

@node WOR "Words I Might Have Ate"

Now it seems I can't keep my mind of you
My brain drifts back to better days we've been through
Like sitting on blacktop of the school grounds
The love I bitched about I finally found

But now it's gone and I take the blame
So there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?

Now I dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me... I am blind without a cause
And now I realised what I have lost

It was something real that I could have had
Now I play the fool whose stable soul's gone bad
Why?

Tell me the words I might have said
That's pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late?
Just tell me the words I might have ate

But now it's gone and I take the blame
So there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?
