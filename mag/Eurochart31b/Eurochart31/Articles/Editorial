        »CL4:by Curt Cool & Cytron

»CL0:Yes, summer's gone. We entered autumn,
and with that, we said goodbye to a
summer which, when talking about the
scene, gave us a lot of productions,
mostly released at the traditionally
big summer parties. Perhaps the scene
is dying, perhaps people are moving
towards other platforms, but we have
seen it: The scene will last a long
time yet, in fact for as long as there
are people in it.
And you people are beginning to get
hold of the productions of this
summer, and you want to find out which
the public think is the best.
And that is where WE come in.
Yes, say hello to »CL1:issue #31 of The
Official Eurochart», the original Amiga
Scene Chart.
This issue is slightly delayed, and
looking back, we can conclude that
this is simply because that we (Cytron
& Curt Cool) are used to finishing
the Eurochart at parties together
instead of sitting 300 km.'s from
eachother. Also, we have been rather
busy with other things (studying,
boozing). And another excuse could be
the lack of good modules, clip-art &
of course the intro which Relish were
supposed to make - but a hdcrash
spoiled that. :(
But don't expect anymore delays, the
»CL1:next issue» will still be released at
»CL1:The Party 7.»
»CL0:Another matter: For a moment we
actually thought we were the only
chart left on the scene, but some of
the people behind »CL1:Rage» have promised 
us competition, and the great
Showtime definitely seems to be »CL1:BACK»
with a vengeance, so perhaps that is
not the way it is going to be after
all? 
Anyhow, read on, enjoy, believe that
this is and always will be the
»CL9:original & best Amiga Scene Chart.»

»CL5:         Cytron at the keys.

»CL4:I hate to admit it, but this was
actually our first 'real' delay. As
far as I remember, we promised to
release the »CL5:Official Eurochart#31»
around the 1st of October. The reason
why we waited a little bit, is that we
simply have so many good »CL5:'reasons for
delay'-excuses» to use, as we haven't
been delayed for three issues :-)
»CL9:'So let's hear them'», you all probably
say. OK, OK!:

»CL5:- Cytron's cat had kittens, and they
  had to be taken care of.
»- Curt Cool's girlfriend left him, and
  he went into a crisis.
»CL5:- Princess Diana got killed, and we
  all had to watch her funeral.
»- Bakerman lost his slimness-wig.
»CL5:- Cytron actually started attending
  classes at school (yeah, right).
»- The Summer and the sun sneaked in
  upon us, so we couldn't see our
  monitors (Of course we didn't
  actually go to the beach!)
»CL5:- Curt Cool went to a barbershop and
  was kept hostage as he refused to
  cut his microphone-hair.
»- A giant spider kept Cytron from
  working on his Amiga.
»CL5:- Quedax realized that he had a PC and
  immediately took a long journey to
  India.
»- Cytron lost all his sources and had
  to have a mourning period.
»CL5:- We were a bit lazy and didn't feel
  like making a chart.
»- Sprocket ate one Kinder Milchsnitte
  (ShitMitte) too much and was sent to
  hospital.
»CL5:- Curt Cool's parents sold his
  equipment leaving him with only a
  Squirrel-SCSI-cable (they thought it
  was a creditcard). (OK OK OK .. That
  one wasn't funny).
»- Dunlop found the meaning of life at
  the bottom of a beer and went
  looking for more truths (hasnt found
  any new ones till now, though).
»CL5:- We wanted more than 100 votes, but
  people were really lazy.
»- The Autumn struck us with storms and
  we got depressed.
»CL5:- Noone wanted to send us clip-art
  before we spanked them (except the
  really cool guys! Thanks!)
»- The time just suddenly hit us, and
  we started too late with the making
  of the chart.
»CL5:- Gizmoduck had his period.
»- We used too much of our time to
  figure out excuses for the delay.
»CL5:- etc etc etc.
»CL8:Anyway, sit back and enjoy our show!
