»CL4:  Creditor (or whatever): Curt Cool

»CL0:The people behind this very issue of
»CL1:THE OFFICIAL EUROCHART» are:

»CL1:Quedax», once again the master of the
bits and bytes contained in the code.
»CL1:Raven/Nuance», the busy man behind both
the design and the great title
picture.

»CL1:Cytron» for the hard work, editing all
the articles, collecting support,
and taking care of the gallery 
section.

»CL1:Curt Cool» for counting most of the
votes, supplying the necessary
information about people and
productions, and being the bad guy to
spam out all the e-mail votesheets and
receiving all the complaints. And of
course writing quite a few articles in
the bargain.

»CL1:Okeanos/Digital», »CL1:Curt Cool/Depth», and
»CL1:Marc/Haujobb» for the three modules.

»CL1:Bakerman» for editing the news.
