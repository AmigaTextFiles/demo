»CL5:*»CL4: History learns us that when the
delay between an issue of a diskmag
gets bigger, there are few issues left
before the main-editor quits his job.

»CL5:*»CL4: History learns us that a magazine of
which every issue requires a lot of
work, about 10 issues will be released

»CL5:(Fishwave & Magic in Seenpoint #6, in 
a truely objective article with the 
headline "DO WE WANT ROM?)


»CL3:*»CL2: History tells us that most mag
editors actually hates competition.

»CL3:*»CL2: History tells us that most mag
editors do their best to confirm the
death of other diskmags with little or
no solid information at all.

»CL3:(Curt Cool in TOE #31)

»CL0:Now we at the »CL1:Eurochart» are proud to
annouce that »CL1:SHOWTIME IS FINALLY DEAD».
Yes, you see, after the brilliant #6
»CL1:Kaos Master» wanted new code, but
unfortunately he wanted that code to
be a bit good, namely ham8 graphics &
design, 3 modules AND the gallery
section in one exe-file of about 800
kb. But as »CL1:Modem» is a really bad
coder, he wasn't able to code that,
and this made him really angry at Kaos
Master, and he told him to (this is
his exact words, you see, we have
wired their phones to spot their
weakness): »CL9:"fuck off or code it
yourself"». This sudden strike of
temper from the otherwise quiet Modem
made »CL1:Kaos Master» very, very depressed,
and even though some unsuspecting ex.
»CL1:Ram Jam» coders said that they would
gladly code a new »CL1:Showtime» for him,
not knowing the miracles he expected
them to perform (or perhaps they
wanted to cheer him up), he decided
to quit the diskmagscene, and let
Showtime die forever.

»CL8:          RAGE IS ALSO DEAD.

»CL4:Yes, it's true. As »CL5:Napoleon» was
hanging out at the local bar in
»CL5:Besancon», »CL5:France», he noticed that some
guys were looking at him in a kind of
strange way. He was getting rather
drunk at the time, and some of his
friends were already leaving
homewards, but he and a friend had
decided to stay for one final drink.
Suddenly one of the guys, who had been
looking at him for a while, perhaps
wondering what a small spectacled guy
like Napo was doing at a rough place
like that. So the guy asked him if
said "»CL5:YouDirtyMotherfuckingFatFaggot
SonOfABitch»" to him, and being quite
provocative, also when drunk, thus
living up to his famous namebrother,
he said "»CL5:Erm, What??»". The big guy
repeated his question, and »CL5:Napo»
courageously answered "»CL5:Hey, I think
I'm about to leave for home, you can
have my beer»". But no, it was too
late, he was already in the fight.
Luckily he had his friend with him,
and his friend just happens to have
the black belt in karate, so the big
guy was hurt very badly. Now, this was
not so bad in itself, but in the
morning, when the adventures of the
night began to dawn for Napo's
intoxicated brain, there was a heavy
knock on his door. And outside the
door, »CL5:two policemen» were standing,
going to arrest »CL5:Napo» for violence
against a functioning member of the
police. And as we all know, French
police have a lot of power, so
»CL5:Napoleon» is now in jail for more years
than he can count himself.
I guess, to rewrite an old saying,
»CL5:"One man going jail, another mans
gold"». Okay, perhaps this sounds
crappy, but it's still the truth.

»CL0:Now, this takes out the life of our
two main competitors, but I read
somewhere that »CL1:Generation» and
»CL1:Seenpoint» are actually dying too. So
what do we have left?? Some »CL9:strange»
mags like »CL1:Insomnia», »CL1:Pressure»,
»CL1:Deadlock», »CL1:No Sense», »CL1:The Jungle»? If
they're not dead that is.

»CL8:Latest right-after-deadline-news:»

»CL0:We at the »CL1:Eurochart» staff have just
seen an announcement from »CL1:Magic», which
was spread on the net and the boards
in a 120k textfile. The essence of
that textfile is that »CL1:Magic/Nah-Kolor»
is going to start a new diskmag called
»CL1:"Magic"», a name he is very proud to
have made up, since, as he puts it
himself, »CL1:it makes the reader think of 
him and all the wonderful things he
have done for the scene through all 
those years». The rest of the textfile 
is about »CL1:Magic» and what a »CL1:great guy» he 
is, how many »CL1:girls» he can take home to 
bed in one night, and what a good 
group »CL1:Nah-Kolor» is.

»CL4:We at the »CL5:Eurochart» staff expect the 
»CL5:"Magic"» to last for the usual amount 
of issues, and you can guess how many 
that is.
