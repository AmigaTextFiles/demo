»CL1:Regarding the "Charting like a faking"
article by Gdm/Lkr in Insomnia#1.

»CL0:As you write a lot of interesting
things about a part of that scene that
I deal with, I feel sort of obliged to
give you an answer. First of all, you
state that charts are far more static
today than they were two or three
years ago. I have to disagree with you
on that point. Looking back through
eg. the »CL1:Eurostatistique(®)» you find
that »CL1:Chaos/Saniity» was »CL1:no.1 coder» at
least »CL1:7 times in a row». »CL1:Facet» was
first or second at least »CL1:8 issues in a
row». »CL1:Jester» was among the three best
at least »CL1:7 issues in a row». »CL1:Desert
Dream» 1st or 2nd at least »CL1:8 issues in
a row» etc etc etc. 
The picture of today is the same. Over
60% of our votesheets has the
following entries in the overall
groups:
»CL4:1. TBL
2. Artwork»
In other words, the scene really IS a
bunch of brainwashed zombies, as you
more or less state in your article.
That's a pity, you might say, but I'm
sure that »CL1:TBL» are happy to see that
everybody is crazy about their
productions.
»CL0:To end this part of my answer, I'd
also like to add, »PIC:Shade3.iff»
that there are
nothing certain
just below the
top position.
Eg. the demo
chart in EC#30.
Pure new entries
from TG97 or
Icing.
»CL8:Where's the
 'staticness'?»

Well, your
article
continues with
some statements,
that chart-editors
 put in a lot of garbage-graphics and
                         misty modules
                          just to make
                       people download
                       the production.
                         Well, that is
                          perhaps your
                              opinion.
                          Personally I
                         must say that
                          we put in as
                               much as
                           possible to
                             give some
                       unknown sceners
                      a possibility to
                         be more known
                         (of course: a
                              »CL1:titlepic
                         by Lazur» was
unnecessary, but we could have told
»CL0:him to go to »CL9:hell». However, we chose
not to.) »CL1:"spray-painted wall"»? Give me
a break! What we're doing to attract
our readers in »CL1:the Official Eurochart»
is trying to be in touch with the
scene. Which charts are important,
which ones have lost their importance?
Introducing the »CL1:4k-intro-chart» from
»CL1:EC#29» turned out as a great succes. As
many voters vote in that category as
in »CL1:Slideshows»/»CL1:Musicdiscs»/»CL1:Diskmags».
Perhaps you find this static, I find
it very dynamic.

About the amount of chart-mags, that
you find too large... Well, I find it
healthy, and I'm quite certain that
there are major differences between
the charts in »CL1:The Official Eurochart»
(DK) and »CL1:Planet» (I), as »CL1:The Official
Eurochart» will naturally have more
Northen European voters and less
Southern European. The reason why is
of course mainly due to the fact, that
(as you write) people are a little bit
too friendly when voting. I believe
that only Danes vote for the plain
Danish group »CL1:Puzzle» as a top five
overall group. But this is not only
due to friendship voting. I mean, how
well-known is »CL1:Puzzle» in Southern
Europe, or in Germany for that matter?
The Danish scener has got almost all
»CL1:Puzzle» productions, but not too many
from southern Europe. That's the way
it works.
The other things, you write about
fake-voting is absolutely not a new
phenomenon, and you would know that,
if you've ever mail-swapped. I
remember lot of letters telling me to
write for diz'n'dat, if I wanted to
keep a cool contact. My personal
belief is that this tendency must have
gone as the mail-swapping-scene is
reduced to a minumum compared to the
good old days when an Amiga was a
plain 500 with 1/2 Meg FastRam
expansion.

»CL1:".., but the fact is, the place in
charts are pure bullshit."» »CL9:No way!» Of
course the lower part of the top 20 is
likely to be changed easily by a
couple of friendshipvotes, but this is
mainly due to the fact that the amount
of voters for a typical chart has
fallen down to a 100. Come on, you
guys! VOTE!!!

So, this concludes my answer to you,
Gdm. And as you write yourself: »CL8:"No
hard feelings"» :-). Cya 
(on IRC, I guess!)
