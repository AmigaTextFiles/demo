»CL4:           By Cytron/Depth

»CL0:Phew. These days have really been a
rush. I didn't sleep at all the other
night, and right now I only have 2 and
a half hours left to finish the chart
and release it before going on Autumn
Holidays. It's really a shame that we
haven't got any intro, but that's the
way it is. If any of you out there
want to make one, please contact us.
And to all you  graphicians out there:
Are you tires of making clip-art?
Anyway. I hope that you like the
overall result of this issue of »CL1:the
Official Eurochart».
The next Eurochart will be released at
The Party 7. We hope to see a lot of
all you sceners there. Please come by
and support us or chat with us. We
just loove company!

»BIG:»CL9:Deadline for Issue#32»»SML:

To make it easy for you, just deliver
all your stuff to us before the
»CL9:8th of December».
I know that we have never been quite
strict with our deadlines, but as I
remeber what is was like last
Christmas, I hope that you WILL keep
this deadline. I can tell you that I'm
going on Christmas holidays the 15th
of December, and any later letter to
me (e-mail as well) will not be
processed until issue#33.
To the ones of you going to The Party
7, we can of course squeeze a little
bit of your work in, if you give it to
us during the first day of the party.
Those we're the words. Now you all go
out there and have a nice Autumn. And
HEY... Let's be careful out there!
