»CL9:»SML:--------------------------------------

»CL1:Feel free to join the gossip-club,
just send some gossip from around the
scene, and it will be added here!

This one came from Paranoid/Depth.


»CL8:4 Play made enemies in the scene.

»CL0:»CL1:4 Play of Resistance» took over a BBS
from »CL1:HandyMan», which is banned from
most (all?) boards in Norway, and
everyone thought they were friends,
but you know scene rumours: they
»CL1:aren't» friends like you all think.
He actally said to me when we chatted
at my board that »CL1:HandyMan» has ruined
his reputation completely, he was
»CL9:furious».
Especially since he already had a bad
reputation for starting a group called
»CL1:"Instinct"» which already existed, and
started spreading need-member-adds at
some of the major boards in Norway.
This must have been one of the major
scene bummers this summer. he later
changed the group name to »CL1:Resistance».
Personally I think »CL1:4 Play/Resitance» is
a great guy, but ofcoz he should have
known about instinct... ;)

Well.. That's about the amount of
gossip for this issue. We hope to make
this section (and al the others)
bigger till next time!
