»CL4:    A short explanation by Cytron


»CL0:As you might have noticed, there is no
intro along with this issue of »CL1:the
Official Eurochart». This is due to
some problems with the group, »CL1:Relish»,
that was supposed to make it. They
offered us to make an intro a long
time ago, and as they're not very well
known, we gave them the opportunity.
Unfortunately they have not been able
to make it for the deadline, mainly
due to a »CL1:HDCrash» on the coder's
machine (As far as we have
understood). Therefore, you have to
settle with an introless charts.
Sorry guys.
