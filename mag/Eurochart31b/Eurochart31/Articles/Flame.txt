»BIG:»CL8:                     Interview with
     »CL9:      Flame/Pygmy Projects

»SML:»CL8: Will we ever again see the cool demos
 from Pygmy? Read on to find out...

»CL0: EC = Eurochart
»CL0: FL = Flame

»CL6:EC: Just to start out, tell us how you
    entered in the demoscene and how
    you got into »CL8:Pygmy Projects..

»CL4:FL: We (me & my bro) have been coding 
    computers since 1983 (Vic-20,
    yeaah! :). After we got amiga, I 
    got involved in scene and
    joined a group called»CL8: The Fantasy
    Force.»CL4: We made some musicdisks and
    intros and packs. The first demo 
    was called Voyage, which came 2nd
    in Byterapers gathering (summer
    1991). 1992 TFF broke and we join-
    ed »CL8:PALACE»CL4: and quite soon »CL8:TSL. TSL»CL4:
    was a poor experience, because 
    they wanted us to do all kind of 
    productions, we never intended to
    do, so we formed »CL8:(we=Me, Cenobit,
    Coconut & Silver Eagle)»CL9: Pygmy 
    Projects.

»CL6:EC: Which productions have you taken 
    part in, and how were they ranked?

»CL4:FL: I dont remember all. But if we 
    leave small intros,music disks,
    packintros etc out, then the list
    is:


      »CL9:TFF:»CL8: Voyage (1991, 2nd,
           Byterapers gathering)
      »CL9:TSL:»CL8: Maximum Velocity (1992, 1st
           some party in sweden,
           if anyone knows which party 
           it was, please mail me :)
    »CL9:Pygmy:»CL8: Extension (1993, 1st,
           Assembly)
    »CL9:Pygmy:»CL8: G-Force (1994, 1st, As-
           sembly,only thing by me is
           the music player)
    »CL9:Pygmy:»CL8: Logic (1995,2nd,Assembly)

»CL6:EC: Your demo for »CL8:Assembly'96 »CL6:didn't
    finish before the deadline...are
    you gonna release it this year?

»CL4:FL: We are hoping to get it released
    somewhere this year, but I'm pret-
    ty sure it will NOT be Assembly 
    »CL6:(Well, it's too late anyway! -RED).
    »CL4:Ofcourse we are not going to 
    release it "as it was", but change
    it and add »CL9:new routines »CL4:etc.

»CL6:EC: What are your plans for the rest
    of this year? Family, »CL8:the Scene
    »CL6:etc.
    And what about Pygmy's plans?

»CL4:FL: Studying and working probably.
    And trying to get the demo finish-
    ed for some party. This is the 
    primary goal of »CL8:Pygmy »CL4:for now. 

»CL6:EC: Who's actually a member of »CL8:Pygmy
    »CL6:nowadays? I heard a rumour that 
    »CL9:Jester »CL6:left »CL9:Sanity »CL6:to join »CL8:Pygmy»CL6:,
    but what really happened? Besides
    the tune for »CL8:"Extension"»CL6: he has 
    released nothing for Pygmy...

»CL4:FL: Members are:
    »CL8:Coconut,Flame,Phobic,Silver Eagle
    »CL4:+ our music fellas:
    »CL8:Cence and Papaija.

»CL6:EC: You have also got a PC, but do you
    use it for coding, and would you
    ever leave the »CL8:Amiga »CL6:for the »CL8:PC»CL6:, 
    like other big coders do?

»CL4:FL: »CL9:I hate many things in PC coding, 
    although I have coded something
    for it. I dont really like the 
    amount of CPU power in modern
    computers for democoding, so the
    PC scene does not seem like a very 
    attractive one...

»CL6:EC: What if the PPC cards ever arrive? 
    Will you start coding demos for it
    or will PPC kill the demoscene?

»CL4:FL: I think 030 50mhz is enough and
    just »CL9:perfect »CL4:for democoding, but
    as faster computers come, people
    want to get all out of their com-
    puter, so its inevitable that the
    scene will go to faster CPU's.
    I dont know if it will kill the 
    demoscene, but it will shape (al-
    ready has) the demoscene to some-
    thing different.

»CL6:EC: And finally, how old are you, and
    how's your future in the scene?

»CL4:FL: I'm 22 and my nearest scene plans
    are the new demo and after that I
    might have trouble
    finding the time for
    scene (finishing the          »PIC:Shade3.iff»
    studies).

»CL6:EC: Thank you for your
    time...


    »CL8:Soo...not all good
    coders prefer »CL9:speed
    »CL8:instead of »CL9:quality».
    Let's have some more
    of that!
