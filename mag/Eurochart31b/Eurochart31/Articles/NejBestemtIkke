»CL4:             by Curt Cool

»CL0:Yes, once again we decide change the
Official Eurochart categories.
»CL1:"But why?"» you may ask, »CL1:"I get all
confuzed when you do that all the
time"».
Well, the matter is that we »CLA:removed
the swapper chart» from this issue and
onwards, and that resulted in a heavy
»CL1:flame-mail-load» towards the editors'
mailboxes from angry swappers who
wanted us to eat shit, smash our faces
into a bloody mass, break our teeth
with baseball bats and so on. I think
you have got the picture now.
(We do!! -CTN)
»CL8:Anyhow», this has made us decide to
»CLA:reintroduce the swapper chart from #32
and onwards». No surprise for you after
reading the above (at least I value my
face & teeth quite a bit).
The chart which will be »CLA:removed» is the
»CLA:"Games" chart», since there aren't
really that many games released these
days, and it seems as if the true
sceners have completely stopped
playing games or just bought a
PlayStation or a PC (the GAMES
machine!) to play on. 

»CLA:So: CHANGE YOUR VOTESHEETS:

SUBSTITUTE THE GAMES CHART WITH
THE SWAPPER CHART.
»
And to the swappers: There is of
course a new votesheet in the
Eurochart archives...

Cytron breaks in for a chat

...Heh, well, as the second main-
editor, I'd like to add, that this
will probably not be the »CL4:final» change,
as Curt Cool suggests in the headline.
I personally like the idea of changing
categories sometimes, as the scene
never has and never will stand still.
That's one of the things, I like about
it! And besides, looking back at the
Eurochart from issue 1-32, a lot of
changes have really undergone the
chart. Think about the good old
'Trackload demo'-category. And note
that the 'Best Intro' wasn't intro-
duced before issue#24 (AFAIK). »CL9:Always
in motion!!» That's the way, I like a
chart!
