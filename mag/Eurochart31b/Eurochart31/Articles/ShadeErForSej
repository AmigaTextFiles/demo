                              by Alive/Digital

 »CL0:Well dear sceners, there's an old and well known saying here in the UK: »CL1:"Your
 past will meet you around the corner"». And it would appear from an article
 in issue 30 of »CL1:EuroChart» entitled »CL1:"A(nother) Reply to Shade"» that my distant
 dark deeds have well and truly caught up with me. It's a cross all us
 scene-celebrities have to bare I guess. Nothing we do goes unnoticed. »CL1:(I hope
 you're all taking that salt now)»

 Just like Bill Clinton - I've been caught with my pants down readers.
 Someone's seen me with my thumb in the pie and poking the neighbour's wife
 as they say. (metaphorically, of course) Yep, I'm afraid there's no escaping
 it, I have to confess: »CLA:I'M A GFX RIPPER!!! Alive IS A GFX RIPPER!»




















 »CL8:                           WEIGHT OF THE WORLD

 »There, what a relief! Sinister secrets like that aren't good for the soul you
 know. I've managed to keep it a secret for this long, but I'm sad to say that
 my dastardly deeds have been exposed by that notorious liar (sorry I forget
 his name) from that mediocre group called Anathema. What can I say. I'm so
 ashamed.

 I just hope the »CL1:Gfx-Twins/Scoopex (now known as Gfx-Twin)» can find enough
 compassion in their hearts to forgive me. I know it was a disgusting thing
 to do. To abuse their trust. I mean, how could I do it. All those long
 "friendship" letters, and what for? Just so I could get my filthy hands on
 their work and rip it, that's what for! »CL9:Haaaaahahahaaa!» »CL1:(oops)»


 »CL8:                      AN IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBILITY?»
 Ahem, errm. Yeah. Well it wasn't an easy task I can tell you. It was pretty
 damn difficult in fact. Well you see, the problem I had with ripping the
 »CL1:Gfx-Twins'» work was that they never seemed to send me any unreleased
 pictures.




















 I continually asked for »CL1:UNRELEASED» work, but they weren't having any of it.
 They'd just say things like: »CL1:"Watch-out for the next Scoopex intro m8!"»
 or »CL1:"wait for our slide"». Yep, that's right, these guys were only sending me
 gfx already seen by the entire scene! Essence logos, ROM, SeenPoint and
 None Sense title pictures. Well you can just imagine the problems this kind
 of attitude caused me. I mean, how on earth could they expect me to rip this
 stuff and get away with it. What a dilemma.

 Indeed, it took many hours of exhausting thought on my behalf. But just like
 the two rippers »CL1:RWO» and »CL1:Louie» - both recently exposed by another notorious
 liar: »CL1:Pha/Agony» - I managed to come up with a perfect solution. All I had to
 do was replace the »CL1:Gfx-Twins'» handle with my own, simple! No one would ever
 suspect. Just look how convincing it looked when I ripped a picture they
 done for C-Lous' None Sense mag:
























                     »PIC:ShadeRip»











































 See, the perfect crime. And if it wasn't for that interfering old goat
 from Anathema I would have gotten away with it too - »CL9:DAMN HIM!»

 »CL4:This article is dedicated to: »CL5:CurtCool», »CL5:Mop» and »CL5:Hollywood» for their wise
 anti-war words to me. I promise, these are my final words on the matter! :)
