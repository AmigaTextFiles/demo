»CL0:
I guess you've all seen it. »CL4:Repugnance
by Powerline». Personally, I have to
admit that »CL1:Powerline» and their coder,
»CL1:Chip» were new names to me until that
demo got released. As I guess that at
least some of you feel the same way, I
decided to invite Chip to a little
afternoonchat via »CL1:IRC». And here's what
I got out of him.

»CL1:<CTN> Cytron.
»CL0:<CHP> Chip/Powerline

»CL1:<CTN> Hi Chip. Could you tell all our
      dear readers a bit about
      yourself?
»CL0:<CHP> I'm a 18 year old guy, going in
      school.. I code as much as I can
      on my beloved Amiga..
»CL1:<CTN> How did you get involved in the
      scene?
»CL0:<CHP> Well.. It all started back in
      1987, when my brother got his
      first computer, the C64.. I
      spent much time on that one,
      coding a lot of basic.. In 1989
      he sold it to me and bought an
      Amiga.. I checked the new one
      out and mostly played alot of
      games..
»CL1:<CTN> Did you know anything about the
      scene back then?
»CL0:<CHP> I knew about the scene yes.. But
      just a little bit.. 
»CL1:<CTN> So, did the BASIC coding
      continue?
»CL0:<CHP> Well, my coding dropped for a
      few years.. Then my brother
      bought an A1200 and installed
      AMOSPro.. I started to code alot
      (again :).. And then I bought
      the computer from him when he
      bought a pc..
»CL1:<CTN> Did you do anything special in
      Amos?
»CL0:<CHP> Naah.. Just testing things and
      the limits of the language.. I
      only did one large program, and
      that one disappeared in a
      HD-crash..

»CL1:<CTN> So, what made you go further in?
      Did you see some nice demos
      then?
»CL0:<CHP> In september 1994 I interested
      myself in the BBS-life, and
      started to call different BBS..
      One was called Dn'A BBS.. On
      that one I met a guy who wanted
      a coder for some projects.. So I
      joined Dn'A at the time, and
      also met Raylight(He called
      himself Dr. Who back then) as he
      joined at the same time.. It was
      supposed to been me who did the
      coding and Raylight who did the
      graphics..
»CL1:<CTN> How did the projects turn out
      then?
»CL0:<CHP> Well.. Rather early we decided
      to skip AMOS and learn ourselves
      some Assembler.. We started to
      study sources and so in January
      1995..
»CL1:<CTN> Who taught you?
»CL0:<CHP> I did.. :) I'm selftaught.. :)
»CL1:<CTN> Autodidact! I like that. Tell me
      more!
»CL0:<CHP> Then a new coder joined, who had
      a few years in coding asm.. He
      was called Picnic.. He had made
      a game that he had proposed for
      Team 17, at the same time as
      Project X.. They looked almost
      the same.. So we decided we
      should make something with the
      stuff we had.. And we started to
      code on a demo for Icing '95,
      about a month before the party..
      On the party, we paniced when we
      realised that our 'main' coder
      didn't want to work on the demo
      anymore.. He just wanted to
      sleep.. 90 minutes before
      deadline and we didn't have
      anything to present.. :)
»CL1:<CTN> Damn. What a shame.
»CL0:<CHP> We sat down, studied his sources
      and started to make it look as
      good as possible.. 5 minutes
      after deadline we gave the
      result to the info-disk. So we
      designed a demo in 90 minutes
      actually.. :)
»CL1:<CTN> Nice! How many contributed?
»CL0:<CHP> Hmm.. 6 groups i think..
»CL1:<CTN> And which rank did you get with
      that?
»CL0:<CHP> We came on 2nd place, because it
      was a lot of 'you vote on me and
      I vote on you'-votes, so Giants
      won with some text and a
      picture.. And a ripped song..
»CL1:<CTN> Hehe.... (Whoever said that this
      tendency started with the PC)
»CL0:<CHP> I think we missed first place
      with one vote.. :)
      »PIC:Shade4.iff»
















»CL1:<CTN> What happened from then? You
      just got better and better?
»CL0:<CHP> We grew a bit because of the
      experience.. :) I started to
      check on how AGA worked and what
      you could mess with.. Picnic
      left us at the same time, so we
      had to stand on our own.. About
      a month before The Party 5, I
      had a fully functional
      AGA-fader.. But in AMOS.. So I
      sat down and started to recode
      it into assembler..  Raylight
      worked on the main code for the
      intro we released, and I think
      that I finished the AGA-fader on
      the party, a few hours before
      deadline. :) I also made some of
      the support-routines (blitting
      etc.) that we used in the intro..
»CL1:<CTN> Did you release anything there?
»CL0:<CHP> No.. Not on the party..
»CL1:<CTN> But later...
»CL0:<CHP> Half a year later, we had a
      shell for a music-disk ready,
      and started to design it.. It
      resulted in that the code didn't
      work, and I had to recode the
      entire shell, so that we could
      release something.. It was
      released in June 1996.. Raylight
      did the last-minute touch before
      the release..
»CL1:<CTN> Was it a success?
»CL0:<CHP> Well.. We don't actually know,
      to this date.. People liked it,
      but we didn't get any huge
      response.. Except for one who
      wanted to become a Pwl-Site in
      Germany.. I should say that we
      renamed ourselves to PowerLine a
      few months before Icing '95..
»CL1:<CTN> Ok.. I got a bit confused there!
»CL0:<CHP> :) I realised that..

»CL1:<CTN> And then.. TP6.. Were you there?
»CL0:<CHP> Yes, we were at TP6, and should
      have released a VERY good
      4kintro.. But we dropped it, as
      we realised that we couldn't
      make it to the first place.. We
      thought.. When we saw who won,
      we realised that we could have
      won the compo..
»CL1:<CTN> Too bad... (And the lesson is,
      dear coders?? :-) 
»CL0:<CHP> So we stopped a bit of the
      activity for 3 months or so..


»CL1:<CTN> But then.. the breakthrough demo
      (In my opinion!)
»CL0:<CHP> But then I started speaking to
      Creon/Paranormal, and about that
      he had a brother who wanted to
      join as a gfx-artist.. And he
      wanted a production to show his
      gfx in.. So one night, Wasp and
      I sat down and designed a small
      'intro' for a demo..
»CL1:<CTN> And he liked it?
»CL0:<CHP> We didn't send it to him first..
      My 3d-engine had at the time
      started to function, and I could
      use the 'wobbling' wall that I
      had coded 7 months back. So I
      wrapped together some small
      parts with the 3dengine and the
      wall behind. And sent it to him.
      He liked it :)
»CL1:<CTN> :-)
»CL0:<CHP> So we started to code and code..
      The effects developed quite
      fast, and every effect in the
      demo took me 10 minutes to
      install and get to function
      correctly.
»CL1:<CTN> 10 mins.. Wow. 
»CL0:<CHP> We decided that we should use as
      many effects as possible.
      Because we think that it's
      better do show something a small
      period of time than a long.
»CL1:<CTN> I agreee!
»CL0:<CHP> A few weeks before Icing '97 we
      started to redesign the demo
      from the beginning, and added at
      the same time some really good
      looking effects. The realtime
      lowpass-filter and the
      interpolated raycast effects.
»CL1:<CTN> Were you proud of the demo, or
      did you keep it a secret at the
      party?
»CL0:<CHP> We showed the demo for those who
      wanted to see. But as we sat
      behind the bigscreen, not many
      saw who sat there.

»CL1:<CTN> Repugnance got released... How
      was the response from the scene?
»CL0:<CHP> Well.. A good friend of mine
      said: 'I thought you were a
      rather bad coder(or something
      like that), but now I see'.. :)
»CL1:<CTN> Hehe. And how about the rest of
      the scene? 
»CL0:<CHP> We got a bit more respect after
      the demo was released.. People
      knew who we were..
»CL1:<CTN> Do you feel more elite now?  Did
      it change your attitude to the
      scene? Or is this elitecoolness
      long gone from the scene?
»CL0:<CHP> Naah.. The whole word 'Elite'
      sux. I hate it. I can't see why
      some people is more 'elite' than
      others.. 

»CL1:<CTN> OK. You said, that you developed
      a 3Dengine.
»CL0:<CHP> Yes.. At the time of the party,
      it sucked.. We displayed I think
      ONE object twice..
»CL1:<CTN> What do you think of 3Dengines?
      Are there too many of them these
      days, or?
»CL0:<CHP> There can never be too many
      engines, but if people don't DO
      anything with them, they are
      useless.. I don't like objects
      who just 'rotates'. That's why
      we didn't let the object in the
      demo be the 'main' effect.
      That's why we used it in
      conclusion with the
      lowpass-filter.
»CL1:<CTN> So you like 3Dengines, if
      there's some innovation
      associated with it!
»CL0:<CHP> Correct.. Something should
      happen IN it or WITH it. Not
      just be there.

»CL1:<CTN> Ok. What is your general opinion
      about the democompos of today?
      The prices, restrictions etc.
»CL0:<CHP> Well.. There are too few
      contributions. :) The prizes are
      ok. But the rules and
      restrictons sux.. 030/50 isn't
      the computer that demos should
      run on today. The PC side uses
      P166, so why shouldn't we.
      That's one of the reasons why I
      signed the TP7-letter..
»CL1:<CTN> Should a demo work on all
      configs? Even standard A1200?
»CL0:<CHP> We tried to make our demo work
      on a stock A1200, but we
      realised that we couldn't get is
      as good as with the 4MB of
      fastram. So i think that demos
      shouldn't demand more than 8MB
      and 020.

»CL1:<CTN> What do you think of the scene
      today compared to your early
      days?
»CL0:<CHP> Well.. Both scenes has their
      special 'touch'. The scene of
      yesterday was a bit more
      agressive i think. Today we can
      reach everyone and talk with the
      persons that we looked up to.
»CL1:<CTN> Which one do you like the best?
»CL0:<CHP> Well... That's a hard question.
      I think I like the current scene
      best, as I have spent most time
      in it. I can't make a good
      opinion about the old scene.

»CL1:<CTN> Hehe! Fair enough... We're
      getting near the end. What are
      your plans for the future .. IRL
      and on the scene?
»CL0:<CHP> Well.. IRL i'm continuing my
      studies and my Magic games with
      my friends :), and in the
      scene. Well. We are working on a
      new production for (hopefully)
      TP7.. We hope that it will be as
      good as Repugnance..
»CL1:<CTN> Great to hear. So you're not fed
      up with coding yet?
»CL0:<CHP> No way. We have just started. I
      won't abandon my Amiga. I simply
      love to code on it.. :)
»CL1:<CTN> Perfect (same with me!). And how
      about your life? What do you
      study?
»CL0:<CHP> Well.. I'm studying (I don't
      know EXACTLY what it's called)
      Electronics & Computers, my
      third year..
»CL1:<CTN> And when will you graduate?
»CL0:<CHP> Hopefully next year.. :)
»CL1:<CTN> And will you start working (and
      continue coding at the same
      time)
»CL0:<CHP> I will probably go on to
      highschool or something.. If my
      grades are good enough.. And
      I'll probably get 3-4.5 years in
      highschool too.. So I'm stuck in
      school.. :)
»CL1:<CTN> Well.. Have you got anything to
      add? If not, I'd like to thank
      you for your time.
»CL0:<CHP> Thanks yourself.. :) I don't
      think so.. 
»CL1:<CTN> Do you want to greet anyone?
»CL0:<CHP> All members in PowerLine
      ofcourse :)
