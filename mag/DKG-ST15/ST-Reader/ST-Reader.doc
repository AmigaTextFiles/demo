				PRESENTS:

	    SHOWTIME article/adverts reader 1.5a by Modem/Darkage

 			* (based on the previous source by Randy/Ram Jam)



What is & distribution notice:

ShowTime is a diskmagazine published by Darkage group, with the demo scene as
subject, and it has also the only CHART alive.
This utility is able to display showtime articles to test them, but you have
to edit articles manually with a text editor like cynus ed.
In the current version it is not possible to place any cliparts within
the articles, but this will be done by the coder himself, as it isnt that
hard to include afterwards.
Cliparts must have the max size of 320x180 in Hires and can use 15 colours.
Mark the place, where the cliparts should be included. In this case, consider
that the 15 text colours available will be the ones of clipart, and not the
default ones!!!!
The text print system is based on the original one by MASE/Ram Jam, but is
recoded and enhanced. The "official" suffix for ShowTime files is ".st".
STread is an utility coded especially for Darkage members that wants to adjust
the design of articles directly, freeing much time to poor Ram Jam coders that
receive only plain ascii texts to adjust.
But, since many article writers like to design their own articles directly,
I decided to release it also to not Darkagers, but the only use of this
utility must be the design of articles for SHOWTIME.
You can send articles, adverts, clip arts to:

Requirements:

This utility needs a 68020+ and AGA chipset, like ShowTime, and also the
reqtools.library in libs:


How to start:

Run this utility from cli/shell, and will appear the file requester to select
a showtime (.st) article. If the st format is wrong, the article will be not
load, and error message(s) will be written in the shell window: look at them!
If you quit, you can choose another file to load (or the same updated in
multitasking with an editor), or quit definitely selecting "Cancel" in the
requester.


Instructions:

Ok, now you have read about the Viewer, but how do I write articles or
adverts for Showtime ?
To edit a ShowTime article you must start from a normal ascii text, without
TABS (use spaces instead), and you can choose between two columns of text
or fullpage, I will explain later how to do that.
You can use all characters, including the special ALT+xx ones, like ²³¢¼½°©ð,
except for 16x16 and 24x24 fonts, that have only normal characters.
You can select the colour and the font type/size, but not load the cliparts,
that is easy for me to apply manually, just reserve the space and give me the
clipart (15 colours hires, max 320x180, when colour0 is "transparent").
Also adverts can be tested, the routine is the same, only consider that in
this part (DIARY) the background is blue and the color 02 will FLASH: to
simulate this, press the MAG<->DIARY swap button in the panel.
I added also the option to convert the article to ASCII only and save it.
Keys: Q to Quit, -> and <- to swap pages.

Well, the commands are:

{               -> To change font and color
}               -> To end text

-The } command don't need comments.
-The { command has a special syntax, which must be used to get a pleasant
 result.

 {Ncc  -> N=font number, cc=colour 00-07

Examples:

{100  Font number 1, color 00
{005  Font number 0, color 05

These fonts are available:

{000  Font num. 0.		8x8 normal
{100  Font num. 1.		8x8 Bold (bold)
{200  Font num. 2.		8x8 fine (fine)
{300  Font num. 3.		16x16 fine (an 8x16 spaced)
{400  Font num. 4.		16x16 full
{500  Font num. 5.		8x8 fine n.2
{600  Font num. 6.		24x24 normal style
{700  Font num. 7.		24x24 style "cowboy"
{800  Font num. 8.		24x24 style "modern"

Now you know how to use fonts and colours for your text, but
if you still need an example, here is one small text:

                                            <- This indicates 38 chars per
-------------------------------------       line, including the "return" !
{304How to paint with {303DPaint {304...

{000Ever tried to paint with {003DPaint {000?
Its so easy, just start the progam
and use a brush of your own....  }

--------------------------------------
The text will start with a 16x16 charset and a green colour, the
"DPAINT" is highlighted in yellow. Afterwards I changed to the
normal charset (8x8 with colour white) and write most of the text,
just highlighting the "DPaint" again (the questionmark is white
again!!!). The last thing is the closing waved bracket, which indicates
the end of the article.

Showtime offers you two modes for your articles/adverts, one or two
columns to be used. If you write articles with 38 chars or less per
line, you will get two columns, but remember that a RETURN on an
editor will also be a character and used in the display, so dont wonder,
if you will get a messy article, if you forget that!
Each column is 38x21, you might check the "design" in order to make the
article more readable and dont cut half of a schedule to another page.

The second mode works with 78 chars per line (full page), if you want this
mode in your articles, you must extend the last line of each page
(line 21) with more than 38 chars (if your line does not have that many
chars in there, use SPACEs to make it larger !!!!!!!). You have to repeat
this for every new page.... This sounds annoying, but gives us the
opportunity to mix both styles in one article (for example, you might
use a plain text with 38 chars per line and use a schedule with 78
lines then. Afterwards you continue with the 38 mode and write the rest
of the article.

Anyway, if you write an article for SHOWTIME, first write it with your
editor and check, if it does fit into the restrictions and re-edit it
(if it doesnt look good).
The last thing you should do is adding the colours, although that will
virtually scrap the design with the 38 or 78 lines it will work, as the
colour-changing chars wont affect the normal text design at all !!!!

-   -	-   -	-   -	-   -	-   -	-   -	-   -	-   -	-   -	-   -
Here is an example of 38/78 columns mode:


If you write max 38 columns  the  text
will  be draw  in 2 columns, like now!


Well,  but is also  possible to write  a max of  78 columns,  in full page: to
hevitate the 2 columns routine you have to exceed  the  38th column at the end
of the page, so ShowTime will understand that is not the  case to draw another
column:

This is the last line, so EXCEED the 38th column to hevitate the 2nd column!


Ok, is all for now!  But remember that
spaces placed over the 38th line in  a
2 column article  can  cause BUGS!! So
check every  time if  there are spaces
over the 38th column!!

IMPORTANT: There are no ckeckings about overwriting texts, especially for
16x16 and 24x24 fonts, so BE SURE YOU ARE NOT WRITING OVER THE SCREEN BOTTOM,
or probably Streader will cause a guru meditation.

NOTE: There is a bug that I was lazy to fix in time: if you read through the
      text until the last page, everything seems to be fine, but if you then
      switch back pages, sometime the colour of the first lines is
      different to its normal state. This is because the last colour from
      the previous read page is applied to the start of actual page...
      To fix it place a color command {xXX in the first line of every page.
      I think this is not a "bug", if you remember to redefine txt colour
      every start of page, when it is required.

History:

News from 1.0 to 1.1:   Now is possible to use all the 15 colours, instead
			of only 8. The range is 00 - 14.
			On the 8x8 fonts now all the ¹²³¢¼½¾·«»-å°©®þ¤µ¡ø
			characters are usable, so you can use ansi logos
			(especially adverts) with alt+xx characters.
			NOTE: you can't use { } § , because are commands.
			{ and } are for text, § is used for cliparts, don't
			insert any § in your texts!!!

News from 1.1 to 1.2:   Added a filerequester using reqtools.library.
			So is needed reqtools.library in libs: dir...

News from 1.2 to 1.3:   Now there is a font n.5, added a st format checker
			that display errors like "out of color", "out of
			font", "you forgot } at the end"... added the
			mag<->diary background palette swapping, added
			an st->ascii converter.

News from 1.3 to 1.4:   Removed the showtime logo and background scaled to 4
                        colors instead of 16, just to make the exe file
                        smaller and save space. You can use the 1.3 version
                        if you like the logo!

News from 1.4 to 1.5:   Fixed the background and set it again to 16 colours.
                        Removed those ugly grey lines between the panels.
                        Optimized the init routine. Now you can draw articles
                        big also up to 50 pages! (update made by Modem/Darkage)

News from 1.5 to 1.5a:  Fake multitasking added (asked by Ghandy), now you can
                        hear modules played with Hippoplayer while executing
                        the STreader. Reduced the right side of the magpanel.
