@Node Edito "Editorial"

Heads up !
 
Welcome to  the  second edition  of Point  &  Rock. It's the number 2
and we have already  some changes  in the form. From now, the concert
dates  table will  offer you a  menu of  the bands. You won't have to
browse all the  table to  read the info  about the band that interest
you !

We  are also  a team  now. Please  welcome Ace... He will  supply you
articles about concert report  and album  tests. We have thought that
we could  create a Oldies but Goodies section where you can find some
old albums that you must listen to.

In this edition, you will find 2 concert  reports about @{"Metallica" Link MetInfo} and
@{"Soundgarden" Link SoundInfo} ( Paris and Brussels ). We give you  also a special bonus
with  the  lyrics  of @{"Load" Link Load}, the  latest  album  of the well known
Metallica. And also the charts.

Can I take  the  occasion to  recall you to vote for these charts. We
really need your opinion because a chart composed by the votes of two
guys, it's quite low !

So don't hesitate to read the @{"contribution" Link Contribution} section.

That's it for today, we  wish you a nice reading through the pages of
Point & Rock 2.

@Node Metal_Bercy "Metallica at Bercy ( Paris ) : 16/09/1996"

Monday, the 16th of  september  1996. Today  is a very good day. I am
going  to Paris  to see one of  my favourite bands : Metallica. It is
their  second gig at Bercy... I went  there 'coz the  belgian gig was
sold-out some days after the beginning of the tickets' sale.

At 10.15 am, I went  to Liège with my friend to take the bus to go to
Paris but also to  buy some  tickets  for the concerts of @{"Soundgarden" Link SoundInfo}
and @{"Kiss" Link KissInfo} in Belgium ( don't miss the report in a next edition ).

The real  departure  took place at 12.00 am. My friend met someone he
has not  seen  since  2 years ( You  must  go to Paris to meet an old
friend... The world is closer ! ). After  some  stops, we finally are
in Paris. It's 06.15 pm. Everyone  was  wearing  a Metallica T-Shirt.
Are  they  in  town  tonight for  something ??? We are checked by the
security guards, our ticket is teared in  two and  we enter the Bercy
arena.

The scene was gigantic. Is was in the center of the arena and divided
into 2 parts, forming a huge 8. On my  right, the  battery was in the
center, in the middle was the technical crew and on my left, a second
stage with two metallic arms down. At each corner of the right stage,
there was an articulated arm with light at the end.

Just the time  to find a good  place, buy some merchandising ( french
prices  are very  high ! Almost  50 % higher  than  Belgium ), listen
to the new album of @{"Rage Against The Machine" Link RageInfo} in loop ( it was getting
boring at the end ! ), and the show was about to begin.
The  support  band  was @{"Corrosion of Conformity" Link CorrInfo}. Their gig started at
07.20 pm ( ended at 07.55 pm ). It was good, the  sound was sometimes
crap, but it was loud  enough to  please me. The public welcomed them
very well. I think they must be glad !

We  had  to  wait  until 08.45 pm to finally see the band. The lights
were  yet on and  Jason Newsted ( bass ) came  up running  around the
stage,  followed  by  James  Hetfield ( vocals  and   guitars ), Kirk
Hammett ( guitars ) was  already on stage. The last Metallica dude to
come was Lars Ulrich under thousands of bestial howls.
The  began  the  show with  a " So Fucking  What ? " with  lights yet
on !!! No time to rust ! They continued with " Creeping death " after
the lights  were  turned of. The lightshow is amazing  with the  four
articulated arms.
James asked  to  the  crowd : " You  want heavy ? We give you heavy "
before  playing  a " Sad  But  True " louder  than  ever, followed by
" Ain't My Bitch ", first  song  from the new album. The new material
works  very  well  live. Load  can  seem  quite  soft sometimes, it's
terrific on stage. Metallica is still Metallica, believe me.
It's time now for some Disco. The  Metalli-Disco  is playing a mix of
this 70's sound  under  the cries of the fans. Place for real music :
they fixed that mistake with an ultra-speeded " Whiplash ".
Tempo was slowing with " Bleeding me " and getting harder with " King
Nothing " where  the  other articulated  arms  on the left stage were
lifted. Lights  were  red and a huge smoke was spreaded. Some strobo-
scopic efects added more atmosphere.
The special effects continued with a classic song of the band " One "
and some explosions on stage. Very great !!!

James Hetfield told that  they were going to play a very new song due
to be released on the  next album. I couldn't  believe my hears. They
were about to  play the  already  famous " Devil Dance ". I must  say
that this song is really loud. Heavier than " Sad But True " in fact.

The band  took  a moment  to rust  while Jason  was playing some bass
soli. For a Maiden fan, it was a great time to hear " Hallowed Be Thy
Name " played on  the bass. Kirk  came up  and  played " My Friend Of
Misery " with Jason. They ended this short  break with " Sanitarium "
where Lars came on stage on his second drums on the left stage.

Second part of the  gig began  quietly  with " Nothing Else Matters "
and the first single of Load : " Until It Sleeps ".
Things get louder with " For Whom  The  Bell Tolls " and " Wherever I
May Roam ". After that, they did an excellent " Fade To Black ".

James  asked  to  the  crowd  who has " Kill 'em All " and " Ride The
Lightning ". It  was to  introduce a long medley of these two albums.
This medley was composed by : - Ride The Lightning
                              - No Remorse
                              - Hit The Light
                              - Seek And Destroy
                              - Fight Fire With Fire
During  this masterpiece, the public reaction was huge. Many slammers
and others gave a lot of work to the Order Service !

It was the end of the show, but they came back after the acclamations
of the public.  Just the time to change the instruments ( and to play
some  accords   of  Wrathchild ( Maiden ) ),  they  played " Shortest
Straw " ( it was a long time we heard this song live ), the very good
" Master Of Puppets " and finally " Enter Sandman ".

The  end  was  very  near. Metallica  managed to end their  show with
a lot of effects. I don't want to give you  those details because you
must  see  it  with  your  own  eyes. If you  know what happenend, it
wouldn't be  the same. I must say  that it is  wonderful and don't be
afraid, they're professional !

The  final part was  arrived and they played some reprises, very well
indeed. We have heard : - Last Caress ( Danzig )
                        - Breadfan
                        - Overkill ( Motörhead )

The show ended at 11:05 pm. So, the  conclusion  of this show is that
since 4  years ( the first time I  saw them ), Metallica  is always a
monster  on  stage. The  put  a lot of  energy, sweat, and passion in
everything they do. I really  encourage you  to see them if they come
near your town ( and I'm sure they will ).

++++++++++++++++++++++++

@Node Sound_Forest "Soundgarden at Forest ( Brussels ) : 10/10/1996"

I have  discovered Soundarden recently  and I must say that this band
has pleased me wiht their music. I think that the comparison with Led
Zeppelin is  not usurped. So I decided  to see them in concert with a
friend.

The support bands were Eleven  and Moby. The first was unknown for me
and the band was  a trio : 1 drummer, 1 guitarist, 1 keyboard/singer.
The singer was a women, her voice was nice. No bass guitar : the bass
was made  with the keyboard  while playing some melodies and singing,
damn !, it's hard...

Moby came after it. Ah Moby ! I had the occasion to see him this year
at  the  Torhout/Werchter festival. This  time, no  techno, only good
Rock. We have heard his famous  reprise of Paranoid ( Black Sabbath )
played in 1 minute. This show was great.

Third part of the event, Soundgarden came. It's the first time that I
assist  to a concert  being so  calm. I was  sitting and enjoying the
show. I must say that I'm not  so big  and I hate hurt my neck trying
to see something.
The show : well, it  was huge... Chris Cornell  is a very good singer
on albums, but on the  very first songs, his voice was bad. You might
have said he was sick. But after it, everything went OK until the end
of the show. 
They  have  alterned atmospheric  songs ( Boot Camp ) with  more hard
pieces ( Rusty Cage ).
At the middle of the show, the band except the singer left the stage.
Chris  staid with  his guitar  and began a solo version of Black Hole
Sun, adding another dimension at the song.

I am pleased  to have seen them. This  show was nice although we were
tired ( so  tired  that  my  friend fell  asleep  during  the slowest
songs !!! ).

@Node use "How to use it?"

Very  easy : you just have to point your mouse on each item you  want
to  read. The program will go to the part of the  mag  that interests
you. 
For the @{"vote form" Link Vote}, select print in the project menu and connect your
printer !!!

I have built  the mag while thinking that each time an information is
available  about a  band ( news, concert or anything else ), the name
would be highlighted. So each  time you  see a  button containing the
name of the band, a simple click will  give  you everything available
about it !

@Node Albums "Albums to listen"

@{b}My Dying Bride : Like Gods Of The Sun@{ub}

This  album is  THE album of  the month. I have  discovered "My Dying
Bride" last year with the show of  Iron Maiden. They were the support
band and I must say that I founded  this kind of music quite strange.
For those who don't  know it : imagine a mix  between a slow and dark
Heavy  Metal with  some classical  music ( violins ). This is special
the first time you hear it but it is magic.
So I saw their new album last week and  I decided to buy it. This new
CD is marvelous. The  atmospheres  are very dark  and deeply sad. The
violin adds  something gipsy. There  also is keyboards  finishing  to
create  this  atmosphere. The  guitars are  very  present  and heavy.
The  way  the  songs  are  created is also disappointing : you have a
certain tempo during 1 or 2 minutes  and after it, a break comes with
a louder  tempo before  speeding up. I like  because it  adds another
depth to the song.
I strongly encourage you to listen this album.

My quote : 9/10


@{b}Iron Maiden : Best Of The Beast@{ub}

Maiden  has  decided to  edit a best of. It coincides with their 20th
anniversary. As usual with Maiden, the  packaging is excellent and it
will be declined in 4 (!) different ways.
- A double Digipack CD with a 60 pages booklet
- A quadruple  LP with a 40  pages  booklet and containing the famous
  "Soundhouse Tapes"
- A double CD
- A simple CD
- And A Video Tape

I have bought  the limited double digipack  edition. The packaging is
nice and  the booklet  is really well-made. There  is a load of infos
about the band ( everything you need to know ).
The more  important  things are the music. All the classics of Maiden
are here : Iron Maiden, The  Trooper, The  Clairvoyant, Running Free,
The Number Of The Beast, and many  more. All the eras of the band are
depicted. You  will also  find the  very first  live  song with Blaze
Bailey. It is "Afraid To Shoot Strangers" and it is a good song. 

Beeing  personaly  a  great  fan of Iron Maiden, this album is a must
have for me. I collect everything I can  find on  them and I must buy
the 4 LP version very soon because of the simple fact that the Sound-
house Tapes are present on the discs !

Everyone who wants to know a little more about Maiden should buy this
album. It is a good representation of what the band is.

My quote : 8/10

You're right but now it's time to kiss your ass good-bye

Dragging me down

Down on your fun
Down and out where the hell you've been
Damn it all down
Damn it unbound
Damn it all down ta hell again

Open doors so I walk inside
Close my eyes find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes
Just to have them close again
Well on my way
On my way to where I graze
It swallows me
As it takes me in his home
I twist away
As I kill this world

Open doors so I walk inside
Close my eyes find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes
Just to have them close once again
Don't want control
As it takes me down and down again
Is that the moon
Or just a light that lights this deadend street ?
Is that you there
Or just another demon that I meet ?

The higher you walk
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body my temple
This temple it tells
"Step into the house that Jack built"

The higher you walk
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body my temple
This temple it tells
"Yes this is the house that Jack built"

Open doors as I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take this in
Let the show begin

The higher you walk
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body my temple
This temple it tells
"Yes this is the house that Jack built"

The higher you walk
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body my temple
This temple it tells
"Yes I am I am I am"

Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away

Where do I take this pain of mine
I run but it stays right by my side
So tear me open and pour me out
There's a thing inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like a curse, just like a stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays
So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you so hold me
Until it sleeps

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip
Don't want your greed
Don't want it
Now tear me open make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me, until it sleeps

It grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you
Until it sleeps (4x)

Don't want it want it want it want it want it no
So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

Now tear me open make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps (5x)

A light that warms no matter where they go
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flame
Do you feel your name ?
Did you hear your babies crying ?
Mama they try and break me
Still they try and break me

Excuse me while I tell them how to feel
These things we turn to me that still seem real
Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking starts the wheels of this play

Don't want your hate
But the fist I make
For you still no fear
No not on me
So please excuse me while I tell them how I feel

But now the dreams end
And now the dreams end
They everlast the night
So build a wall
Behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now ?

Please pry it open

And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
And when you see me stretched remind me of what left this outlaw torn

And if I close my mind in fear
