(c)February 1999.



"Lalalalalala!!!"»CL0:   Soda,  the  ex-big
boss  behind Retro, was singing a song
as  he  was  very  happy.  He had just
made  the decision to quit with Retro.
The  Scene  was  sad  but he loved it.
More sparetime and an improving social
life  for Soda!  As a result from that
Soda    became   the   idol   in   his
neighbourhood.  People loved him.  All
the  girls  wanted to date him and all
the guys wanted to hang out with Soda!
His  social  live  was going great and
his grades in school became better and
better.   Soda  couldn't be more happy
and he showed it.  Sane and Magic were
both sitting on a side of Soda.  Magic
sang along with his boss but Sane kept
his    mouth    shut.    Sane   looked
depressive.    Depressive?    No   ...
Angry would be a better definition.
Soda,  Sane  and  Magic  had  gathered
again  in  their  favourite bar.  This
time  not  to celebrate the release of
an issue of Retro but to celebrate the
fact  they had quit with Retro and had
gotten  improved  social lifes because
of  that.   Soda  had also invited the
other  members  of  the ex-Retro-staff
but those guys had other things to do.
They  had  even better social lifes as
Soda and did not want to hang out with
these three lamers.  Anyway, our happy
couple  (or  make  that  triple)  were
sitting  behind  their  private table.
Soda   liked  to  call  that  table  a
"private" table but in fact it wasn't.
It was a table were any other customer
could  sit  when  they  would like to.
The  fact  the  table  was placed very
near to the toilets, so an abominable,
sickening   stench  could  be  smelled
ninety  percent  of  the  time, caused
that  there  were never people sitting
in that spot.
















Soda   addressed  to  Sane  and  said:
»CL1:"Sing   along  you  bastard!"»CL0:  and  he
continued    »CL1:"Lalalalalalalalalala!!!"»CL0:
Sane  looked  the other way and took a
sip  of  his beer.  »CL1:"Lalalalalalalala!
Yes!    Yes!    SAAANEEE!!   join  us!
Lalalalalala!"»CL0: Magic shouted whilst he
and Soda clapped in their hands on the
rythm  of  some  Bryan  Adams-popsong.
Sane  poured the rest of his beer down
his  troath,  stood  up  and walked to
the bar. »CL1:"Can  I   have  three  beers,
please?"»CL0:  Sane  asked  the lady behind
the  bar.  »CL1:"Lalalalalalalalala!"»CL0: could
be  heard  in  the  background.   Sane
looked over his shoulder and shook his
head when he paid for the beers.



»CL1:"Great!"»CL0:  Soda  cried out in between a
few »CL1:"lalala"»CL0:'s when he gasped for air,
»CL1:"BEER!   That's what I needed!" "Yes!"»CL0:
Magic  said  »CL1:"Beer  is  what  we need.
Thanks  Sane!" "Fuck off lamers!"»CL0: Sane
said  back »CL1:"The beers are mine!" "Come
on  you lame son of bitch, you useless
excuse  for  an  ex-editor"»CL0: Soda cried
out  »CL1:"Give  me  and  Magic our beers!"
"Damn  you!   You ain't getting one of
these  beers"»CL0:  Sane  responded.   »CL1:"You
bought  three  beers,  Sane matey ..."»CL0:
Magic  whispered »CL1:"For whom did you buy
those beers if you didn't get them for
me and Soda?!" "For me, myself and I!"»CL0:
Sane  answered  whilst he laughed very
loudly as he saw Magic's dumb face.



»CL1:"One  ..."»CL0:  Sane  gobbled up the first
beer  »CL1:"Two  ..."»CL0:  the second glass was
empty  now  »CL1:"And ...  THREE!" "Why are
you   acting   so  lame,  Sane?"»CL0:  Soda
shouted.   »CL1:"First  you  refuse to sing
along  with  us which basically ruined
our  little  party."»CL0:  Soda's  head had
turned  red  and  one could see he was
about  to lose control.  »CL1:"Then you buy
three   beers   but   drink  them  all
yourself!   What  kind of a lame, sick
and   no-good-for-nothing  FRIEND  are
you?"»CL0:   Magic   interfered  and  said:
»CL1:"Yeah  man.   We  are  a team.  We are
friends.   We are supposed to have fun
because  we  made  a big decision.  We
quit   with  Retro  and  improved  our
social         lifes        majorly!!!
Lalalalalalalalalalalalala!"»CL0:      Soda
joined  Magic and they were crying out
together  »CL1:"Lalalalalalala!"  "Shut up!
SHUT   UP!"»CL0:  Sane  shouted  »CL1:"Shut  up,
fools!   I  am not your friend ...  in
fact:  ....  I ... I ...  I ... I HATE
YOU!"















"Lalalalalalalalalala  ...."»CL0:  When the
impact of Sane's words struck Soda and
Magic,  they  fell silent.  After five
minutes of silence Soda was the one to
break  it:  »CL1:"Why do you hate us, Sane?
I  thought  we  were  friends?!"»CL0:  Sane
said:   »CL1:"We  were  friends.  Even good
friends.  Even very good friends. Even
very,  very  go..."  "We get the point
Sane!"»CL0:   Soda  interupted  »CL1:"Continue!"»CL0:
Sane  went  on  »CL1:"  ...  until THAT (he
pointed  his  finger  at Magic) sucker
wrote the most idiotic, utterly lamish
article  ever written on Amiga and YOU
placed  it  in  Retro  4!" 
"Well, Sane"»CL0: Soda said »CL1:"I placed every
article  which  I  got  into my filthy
hands.    Whether  I agreed  with  the
contents or  whether I didn't. Whether
it was well  written  or not. I placed
every  single  article!"»CL0:  Soda went on
»CL1:"So I really don't have anything to do
with  this.   Now  do  I?  I'll get us
some  drinks.   I'll  get us something
stronger.   Now  you two talk about it
and ...  Behave while I am gone!"














"What  article are you talking about?"»CL0:
Magic   asked.   »CL1:"The  one  which  was
placed  in Retro issue 4.  The article
in  which you claim Scoopexians aren't
ethical, egghead!"»CL0: Sane said. »CL1:"OOOOOH!
That  one!   Well ..."»CL0: Magic said »CL1:"Too
bad!   I  really think, in fact I even
know,   Scoopexians   truely  are  not
ethical!"»CL0:   Magic  continued  »CL1:"Scoopex
isn't  ethical.   The group is too big
to  remain  ethical.   And because the
entire   group  is  not  ethical,  the
single   members   can't  be  ethical!
Scoopexians are NOT ethical!"

"THEY,   eh  WE,  ARE  ETHICAL!"»CL0:  Sane
shouted.  »CL1:"You are NOT!"»CL0: Magic said.



»CL1:"we ARE!"
"NOT!"
"ARE!"
"NOT!"
"ARE!"
"NOT!"

»CL0:---this went on for many more lines--






























After  a while Sane became so tired of
the  discussion  that  he  went bezirk
(Sane  always goes bezirk when he gets
too tired).  He unbuttoned his jacket,
reached  for  his  shoulderholster and
took  out  his  .44  Magnum.  »CL1:"BAAAM!"»CL0:
With  one  quick blow Magic's forehead
was blasted away.  Blood gushed out of
the  wound  and  was splattered across
the  area.  Magic was lethally wounded
and died within a few seconds.  Whilst
Sane  wiped  some  of  the  remains of
Magic's  brain  from  his right cheek,
Soda  came  back  with  three Wodka's.
Soda looked at Magic and then adressed
to  Sane.   Soda said ....»CL1:" ....  Now,
Sane  ...   That  was not very ethical
....  "

"BAAAM!"»CL4:
