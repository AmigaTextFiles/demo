»CL0:Herzlich willkommen to the 37th issue
of »CL1:The Official Eurochart». The Easter
partying season is over, the sun is
shining outside and our minds are
longing for the summer holidays before
which some nasty exams will
unfortunately have to be passed - at
least I think most of you feel the
same way.
Also, 1999 will bring some jubilees
for »CL1:The Official Eurochart», so prepare
for some surprises - or alternatively,
surprise us with some surprises...!
The »CL1:Symposium Mekka» and »CL1:The Gathering»
showed us that the scene is definitely
still alive and kicking - though the
Gathering has unfortunately now become
so much of a quake-lamer party that no
scenegroups seem to bother to release
anything there, whereas at the
»CL1:Mekka-Symposium», playing quake is
simply not allowed - so it should not
come as a surprise who had the best
releases. Because it is good to see
the comeback of »CL1:Skarla» with what looks
like the most impressive engine so
far, according to several of the
leading coders. It is good to see that
calculated samples and graphics in 40k
intros has now become the rule rather
than the exception. Good to see
that it is still possible to do new,
original effects on the Amiga. That
new impressive productions from new
impressive groups can still be found
(»CL1:Potion» on the »CL1:Astrosyn»). That »CL1:Haujobb»
is still alive to win demo 
competitions. And that certain old
diskmagazines and editors are still
alive (»CL1:Zerox» & »CL1:Jurassic Pack»). And
that sceners can drink beer without
spoiling everything for everybody (the
»CL1:Symposium-Mekka» =) (Cheers -CTN)
It is good to be on the Amiga scene -
because we layed the first stones in
what could become the art of the
future.
