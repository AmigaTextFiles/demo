»CL0:Time hardly flies when you have an
eager scener like Curt Cool as captain
of this 37th issue (at least) of the
EC. Magical Moments is back for the
second time in 1999, or should I say
3rd ? Maybe you have noticed that a
slightly changed 'MM' corner ended up
in Retro 4 while it was published
earlier in the Eurochart 36. The
reason for this was quite simple
really, Retro died back then. (Or so I
thought..)

»CL0:Soda was no where to be found, the 4th
issue should have been out for weeks
so I left the mag and allianced with
the EC. Then suddenly Soda came back
and released Retro 4. Afterwards we
tried to make a 5th issue but then
Darkus left for his own magazine (soon
to be released) Soda joined Scenetime
as Main-ed (read about this later on
in this corner) while Sane is still
trying to succeed with his Jedi
education :)



»CL0:So here I still am (writing one
article to the other since 1992..)
Well, long live the Official
Eurocharts!


»CL9:Magical Moments History
»CL7:--------------------------------------
"Every Generation has a legend; Every
saga has a beginning" This also counts
for my corner. Magical Moments (from
now on MM) originates from 1995. In
the middle of this year I made the
concept and was advertised in Trinity
issue 1 (which by the way was
main-edited by me and Sane :) However
this magazine project went up in
smoke. Thus I contacted a new main-ed
in the scene called Fishwave, who
gladly refused my corner and
Rokdazone's Marvellous Lunatics Ball
for issue 2, since he didn't want to
have such dominating parts by other
writers in his magazine (Hmm do I
remember this correctly Adrian?)
Luckily Buzz issue 7 (At The Party
1995) was willing to publish my first
MM corner.. Later on when I
coordinated nAh's new Musicdisk, I
decided to call it 'Moments' :)
Ironicly pointing out that (scene)
life has just a few moments which will
be very special.. At the end of 1998 I
decided to continue the MM corner, and
now the 3rd edition (of nine) is
finished. Hastalavista baby.. :)
