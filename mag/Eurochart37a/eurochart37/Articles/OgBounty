»CL0:In a small, dark room way up north in
the middle of a small town in Austria
a middle aged scener is crying softly;
Just a few hours ago he received the
29th issue of Generation from a friend
and he has eagerly read trough all the
pages for the one article he had been
dying to read for over two weeks now.
The power company still didn't regain
the power to all the houses in
Austria. Luckily he had a small
generator to power his Amiga and
monitor for about thirty minutes and
twenty-four seconds.

»CL9:Two Weeks Earlier...
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Life on our cozy planet was evolving
as usual, however the president of the
United States emerged a life TV
broadcasted press conference.. Not
that the world looks up to this
presidental behaviour these days, but
the press and certainly a certain
Saddam Hussein were really curious.

After the Presidental presentation the
world was in a shock! Twelve
Asteroid's are on collision with
Earth. And this just 2 days before the
world would celebrate the new year of
2000.. The bad thing was that there
were just 4 days left before the
impact! What's a new year's eve when
people don't know if the human race
will prevail only 2 days later?

Obviously Earth doesn't give up that
easy and thus a special mission was
organized to save all human life on
our planet.









»CL9:Mission: Desert Fox
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:America already assembled the space
shuttle for a quick lift off, together
with 20 nuclear missiles(tm) and 2
nuclear hyper bombs(tm) Of course a
special team was put together with
Curt Croft as leader of the bunch.
Eight of the twelve asteroids are not
bigger that the size of 30 soccer
fields, however three of the four
remaining have the size of our moon,
while the last one - the biggest of
the twelve - has the size of 9 billion
Ferraris behind each other.

The space shuttle takes off, with one
of it's most important missions to
date. Reaching the Asteroid field,
Curt Croft immediatly fires six of the
»CL0:eight smaller Asteroids out of space.
He is now flying towards the three
Asteroids of equal size, and fires a
nuclear hyper bomb(tm) disintegrating
the three in a nano-second..

The biggest of the asteroids is a bit
tricky. But Curt Croft - with in mind
only the survival of the human race
and his Amiga - flies into a tunnel
and reaches the inner circle of the
biggest asteroid. He first fires 3
nuclear missiles(tm) then he fires his
2nd nuclear hyper bomb(tm) and makes
his way out of the asteroid. BLOW! The
big asteroid collapses and Curt Croft
almost saved the day!



»CL9:Independence Day ?
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:The two remaining Asteroids are
already long gone, but Curt Croft sets
in a course to reach them before they
hit Earth.. Curt Croft tries to aim
his remaining nuclear missiles(tm). A
nervous feeling floats trough Curt
Croft's belly. "The Force Is With You"
the voice of Obi-Estrup Kenobi is to
be heard in Curt Croft's cockpit. Then
he fires .. WhooSh!

It's already in the evening when the
president of the United States made
public that except for the two
'smaller' asteroids all the others
were destroyed. The two remaining
asteroids will both have a deep impact
in Europe. Curt Croft failed to
»CL0:destroy the last two asteroids!
However his name is forever written
down in Earth's history books..

»CL9:Havoc & Chaos within Europe's boundries..
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:In a comfortable bunker a somewhat
older man with a mustache in a army
suit is talking to some of his people,
when a loud rumbling takes place.. A
very loud sound is mastering the
silent sky. The first asteroid hits
the ground. With the strength of 10
nuclear bombs(tm) it destroys
everything on its way. The people
around the table are raising their
hands and in their final seconds they
hail their master. Long live Saddam,
Long live Saddam, Long li...

The last asteroid had it's impact way
east of Austria. Destroying all
infratructure and communication means
in the whole country. The bottom half
of Austria is almost destroyed one
hundred percent.

»CL0:After the green light was given,
Uyanik of Trsi just reached his
homeland after a business trip selling
his Recordz in Australia, and brought
the 29th issue of Generation with him.
Luckily he lives in the north of
Austria like his friend, known to us
as 'the middle aged scener' ..

The middle aged scener who got the new
Generation issue from Uyanik just read
the results of The Party 1999. His
contact with the scene was 0,0% since
the impact of the second Asteroid two
weeks ago. "Please don't cry
Antibyte.." Uyanik says. "But.. but
our demo didn't win, Alien3 didn't
win!" Antibyte is whispering in a
state of paranoia while tears are
rumbling down on his face..
