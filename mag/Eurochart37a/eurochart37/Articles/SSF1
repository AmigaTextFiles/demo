»CL7:                         [ english version two ]

»CL0:    did  you  know that there is a demo scene in yugoslavia?  did you know
that  just  in  the  last two years, 6 demo parties were held in belgrade?
can  you  allow  yourself  to  miss  another  one?  maybe so, but THIS ONE
surelly no ;>>>

    scene  strike  4 [also known as ss4] is computer demo party which will
be  held  in  April,  3th  and  4th  1999 in cinema rex cultural center in
belgrade.  like our previous organised events, we tend to make even better
and more interesting scene party for both attendants and compo winners.





















»CL9:                             f e a t u r e s

»CL0:    beside 'tradional' competitions in computer demos, intros, animations,
graphics and music, ss4 prepares:
    »CL1:-»  concert with yugoslav scene and non-scene musicians.  this event is
being prepared with nexus organization from indjija, so you better prepare
yourself  for  some  serious mindshit.  it will also be visually supported
with realtime demo mix which will be done by corrosion posse.

    »CL1:-»  update  special  demo  showdown,  presenting  new  concept  of demo
showdowns.

    »CL1:-» local network with internet access.

    »CL1:-»  tradional  contents  like normal demo projection and networked game
consoles will be again available to everyone interested in abusing them ;>
quake  tournaments  and  similar  mass  gaming  crap  nonsense will NOT be
organized,  the gamers are definitelly not going to have nice time on ss4.
scene strike is DEMO PARTY which aims to gather and to support DEMO SCENE,
and plans to keep that hardline.




















»CL0:    there  will  be no computers available for public usage, so you better
pack  yourself on time, and bring your computer along with you in order to
be a real party member and not JAFO ;> we are receiving table reservations
in  the  ASAP  manner, because there is a limited amount of tables, so act
now, and reserve yours on time!

    local  network  and internet will be present and available, but always
keep  in  mind  that  their  primary use is for the party and its realtime
presence  on  the net.  problems caused by the local game seasons will not
be tolerated.

    entrance  fee  is 30 yugoslav dinars [3-4 DEM] and is valid during the
whole party time.  girls also pay - in the spirit of equal rights.



























»CL9:                        f o o d   &   d r i n k s

»CL0:    during  scene  strike  4 party, little bar will be open in cinema rex,
but  since  rex  is  located  in  the city, there won't be any problems in
getting  any other food or drink or anything in any time of day and night.
there  are  plenty  of  shops  and fast food restaurants working round the
clock.   drinks are not forbidden, but bottled drinks are not permitted to
bring in, because of various reasons...

    if  you  are by any chance organizing some group trip from the far [or
even  from  abroad]  please  drop  us  note  over email, so we could maybe
organize some help!

»CL9:                       --- competition details ---
        --- [for those always complaining about competitions] ---

»CL0:    since ss4 comes up with the new conception of competition schedule, in
order  to  free  up  sunday  afternoon's overload, there will be 3 [three]
deadlines.   graphics  categories  will  be  shown twice during the party.
more  info on these deadlines and competition time table could be found in
schedule   part   of   this  invitation.   almost  all  time  between  the
competitions  will  be  filled  up  with fast and suprise competitions, so
there is almost no chance to get bored during whole party time.  ;>>

    amiga  and  pc  categories  will not be mixed in any way.  if there is
only   one   entry   for  the  specific  demo  or  intro  competition,  it
automatically wins the competition and gets the prize [if planned for that
competition].   music  categories  are  expelled from this rule, all music
competes  together  in the appropriate category [4channel or multichannel]
nevertheless it is made on amiga or pc.























»CL0:    music  categories,  in  which  normally  we get too many entries, will
probably  be  preselected, most likely leaving 10 modules in each category
to  compete.   that situation will provide better listening to competiting
tunes  and a chance to actually listen multichannel music without becoming
dead  bored.   the  jury will be spontaneusly selected at the party place,
and  it  will  most  likely  consist  of musicians from all present active
groups.

    4channel  competition is protracker only, which means that all modules
must  be  playable from classic protracker 2.3.  module can be made on pc,
but  must  be playable by pt2.3 on amiga.  this competition will be played
from  amiga,  using  hippoplayer.   amiga  &  pc  entries  are mixed, this
category is multiplatform.

    multichannel  pc  entry  can  be  made  in fasttracker[_ii] (xm, mod),
impulsetracker (it), or screamtracker (s3m) format.  pc multichannels will
be played from modplug [or some better player, if available].























»CL0:    multichannel  amiga  entry  can  be  made  in  soundstudio  [mmd3]  or
digibooster  [dbm]  format.   amiga  multichannels  will  be  played  from
hippoplayer.    amiga   &   pc   entries   are  mixed,  this  category  is
multiplatform.

    graphics  competition  entries  will  be  displayed  from  appropriate
machines,  depending on their resolution and depth, but author can ask for
specific  machine  to  be  used  to  show  his  work.  same goes for ascii
competition, ansi is not allowed!

    we suggest you bring your wild entry on vhs tape.  alternativelly, you
may  use  some  od  the  compo machines as animation player in some of the
common  formats  on amiga or pc.  if your production utilises some special
software  or  hardware or whatever you use, you must bring it with you but
you must inform us before party starts [before april 3th!].
