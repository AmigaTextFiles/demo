»CL0:After we produced the fourth issue of
Retro and started on the fifth one
Soda agreed on Modem of Darkage his
offer to become the new main-editor of
Scenetime. Infact scenetime and Retro
merged, keeping the Retro name. (Using
Modem's magazine codework ?) While
Darkus left the editor staff, Soda
accepted Modem's offer, I left Retro.
Meanwhile just three weeks ago prior
Soda e-mailed us he had some real
life-problems. Read on..
»CL9:The Death Of Soda's Social Life ?
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:All what may, or may not, have caused
the death of my social life here in
Moss :D (Soda's hometown ed.) Of
course, the result of this tragic
incident will directly affect my
scene-career, because if it turns out
to have put a final ending to my
social life, I will have a lot more
time for the scene, that's for sure!
:)

Well, anyway, I guess I should stop
jibbering, and tell you all what has
happened. On friday there was a small
gathering at one of my mates' house...
Just me, my mate and 15 other guys and
gals were gathered to drink a lot of
booze, to fight, to make friends and
to make love. :) Now, I don't know who
of you I might have told this to, but
at the time being, I'm going steady
with a girl called Camilla. Now,
Camilla, she is one hot babe. :) She
is the best looking gal in Moss, and
I'm more than happy to be her "special
someone", and of course, she was
present at the above-mentioned
party... :) We arrived together, and
people were happy to meet us, smiling
I introduced Camilla as she didn't
know everybody, and we soon had a
seat, starting to chat with
everybody... Now, I begun the evening
quite slow, at first drinking no more
than 4 beers, but soon things
progressed, and when I suddenly
realized that I was out of stuff to
drink, I had drunk no less than 14
beers and half a bottle of wine... In
short, I was shit drunk.

Now, at this point, my memory goes
black. I don't remember one single
thing of what later happened, until I
the next day woke up in my own bed. In
other words, I went from the party to
waking up the bext day without
recalling anything... Everything I
will now tell you, has been told to me
by mates...

Things were going great at the party,
and I chat with a lot of people.
However, as I became more and more
drunk, I started falling out of the
discussions, and I was left alone to
sit quietly... Apparently, I didn't
like this very much, because I must
have wanted some attention. A normal
person might have tried to gather
himself, but no, that wasn't an option
for me... What I did, holding my right
arm around Camilla, was PEE my jeans!

Ha ha, yes, I actually peed my pants,
and suddenly someone screamed out -
accompanied by buckets of laughter
"Erling (Soda's real name ed.) has
peed his jeans!!!" Of course, this
caused uproar, and people started
shoving me, teasing me like there was
no tomorrow. From what I hear, Camilla
also had a good laugh, but I *really*
don't think she thought of it being
too funny. :)

Well, today it's Monday, and this
happened on Sunday. I tried calling
Camilla yesterday, but she wasn't
home, so instead I just told her
mother to tell her I was sorry,
without mentioning what for exactly.
;) If Camilla chooses to overlook this
incident, and continue our good
relationship, things will be all fine
and dandy, but if she doesn't, I'll
spend the coming week in front of my
screen, and if that happens, I can
guaratee you that I'll write more than
5 articles ;D

He he, okay, I know I'm a lamer, and
since word about this incident now
also has reached the UK and the
Netherlands, (as if entire Moss wasn't
enough!) I think I'll call it a day :)

Anyway, I'm off :) Oh, and if you ever
have experienced anything similar to
this, which might milden my shame,
please tell me about it! :D Right now!
:)

»CL0:So now the whole Scenish Community
knows about Soda's misfortune, though
we sincerly hope Darkage won't be lead
to do anything against Soda because of
this.. ;-)

»CL1:A note to Soda:
- Hey, sorry man, but it was just too
darn tempting to make this article! :)
