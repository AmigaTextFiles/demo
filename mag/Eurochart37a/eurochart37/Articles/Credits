»CL0:The code was as usual made by 
»CL1:Quedax».

Most of the support & votes was
collected and counted by »CL1:Curt Cool»,
who also found time to write an
article or two, while spending most of
his time rehearsing and acting in the
students revue in Odense. Oh, and he
also did the news and adverts
sections.

Everything was assembled and put
together by »CL1:Cytron», who also edited
the Gallery section and coded the
final version of our superb votetool,
during a while of heavy drinking and
studying.

We had the luck of being helped by our
dear co-editor »CL1:Magic/Nah-Kolor» who has
been a busy little beaver writing a
whole new »CL1:Magical Moments» section,
just for you.

As other contributing editors, we this
time have »CL1:Sane/Scoopex», »CL1:Leunam/
Network», »CL1:hund./Depth», »CL1:Allanon/Depth» &
»CL1:Ghandy/Darkage&Faith&Gods».

The design & title picture was 
lovingly crafted by Czech gfxmaster,
»CL1:Artie/Embassy» - a design where you 
are actually able to read the charts
- something we are not exactly 
accustomed to!
»CL0:The last-minute improvised clip-arts
were drawn by »CL1:Sprocket/Depth», »CL1:Seven
Eleven/Ascend» and »CL1:Curt Cool/Depth» -
support us a bit more with clip-arts
next time please!

As »CL1:Virgills» module did not fit in
size, we needed some more music for
this issue as well. So why not ask
»CL1:Marc/Haujobb» at the »CL1:Symposium» - so we
did, and whoopsie, we had the first
module, entitled "»CL1:The Wind Chimes»".
But one module wasn't quite enough we
thought, so »CL1:Curt Cool» went composing
the night before the »CL1:Symposium», and
finished "»CL1:Easter Eggz»" there after
being hit by an egg in the face
himself. »CL1:Cytron» was also competing in
music competition at the »CL1:Symposium»,
and he made a special eurochart mix of
his module, entitled "»CL1:Slobby»". And as
an extra bonus, a 4th module, namely
"»CL1:Relax, Max»" by »CL1:Curt Cool» was included
- so now at least the editors are
happy since they have now forced their
musical excrements onto people's
sensitive ears.

Other thanks must go to »CL1:Thorr/Whelpz»,
»CL1:MadBart/Appendix» & »CL1:Carp/Apathy» for
various support. And also to all who
gives us plenty of moral support - you
know where you are and who we would be
if we were without it. Cheers!
