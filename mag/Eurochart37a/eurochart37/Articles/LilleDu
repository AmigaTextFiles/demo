»CL0:Some of you might remember scene times
without the mighty internet, irc or
e-mail. Some of you might remember the
good old days where so called 'Message
Boxes' were a real highlight in the
excistence of the scene. When you got
a floppy disk in a small white
envelope from an old swapping pal of
yours. When slowly a big smile on your
face occured, when you discovered that
some sceners actually wrote a message
to you in such an occasion. But these
days over-exposure of communication
threatens the scene. The 'online' VIS
being interviewed few times a year,
more quarrels due to more
communication. Where once were
messageboxes nothing remained. They
either morphed to full diskmags (only
Generation survived until now) or
totally disappeared forever. When
there is no need to make it, the
product is a goner.. 
Like my good old pal Dreamer did with
his modules, I will dedicate this
article to a scener: Tomcat of Mirage.
The inventer of the 'What If..'
article series in the good old Chit
Chat message box from Dutch origin.
(Anybody remember the nice ECS title
pics in Chit Chat of woman by Danny ?
:) Word Up Tomcat!
