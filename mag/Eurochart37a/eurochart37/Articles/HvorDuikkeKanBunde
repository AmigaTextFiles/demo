»CL0:It was a long time ago since I read
the last issue of Generation,
main-edited by my old scene colleque
Rokdazone. Reason for me to e-mail him
and to ask what's going on, if
something was going on that is ;)
Well, Rokdazone started a small
business on the internet but a new
issue of Generation WILL come he
commented, though he quickly refered
to the next question :)

»CL9:Tiefsee, Music & Internet

»CL3:RokDaZone:
»CL2:"Tiefsee is a combined music
distribution and internet company.
Internet is selfexplanatory I guess:
Webdesign, -marketing and stuff.
Music distribution means that we take
MP3 from Electronica artists all
around the globe and put excerpts of
1.5 to 2.5 mins on our page for a free
download for everybody. In the same
second, record companies and radio
stations who have shown interest in
this site get informed about the new
stuff and they promised to send out
their talent scouts to find new
projects to sign for their label. We
then get a "contact-provision" from
the label and everybody is happy."

»CL4:"But what about the Amiga Scene, still
following the latest developements?"

»CL3:RokDaZone:
»CL2:"Haven't seen anything in ages, the
floppy of my Amiga is broken and so I
can't see anything for now. Have to
wait for CD-Roms.."

»CL0:And here we have it. I think RokDaZone
maybe found a 'hole in the market'
using the internet to scout for new
musical talent.. Take a look at the
Tiefsee homepage at
http://www.tiefsee.de
or if you are interested to do some
business with RokDaZone, e-mail him at
brau@tiefsee.de

»CL1:Note to Henning: I won't charge you
for this free commercial (:
