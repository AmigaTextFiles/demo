»CL1:[Prologue by Curt Cool/Depth]

»CL0:hund./Depth is a PC owner who, like
most competent PC users, is pretty
dissatisfied with the state of
Microsofts products. There is a form
on Microsofts homepage under a section
called 'Defending our right to
innovate. We here at the Eurochart are
sure that all of you will in some way
benefit from reading what he wrote -
or at least have a good laugh.

»CL0:I have just read the "message from
Bill". His speech on "defending our
right to innovate". Several times it
is mentioned that MS is defending
itself against the gonvernment and
envious competitors rather than
consumers, and that the consumers
aren't complaining.

I cannot believe you would even say
this in public.

Less than one percent of the people I
have talked to in my lifetime about
windows and microsoft products in
general have been satisfied. And the
rest haven't excactly been wishing for
more features. They have been genuine
dislikers of microsofts business
strategies and the instability of MS
software.

The only thing that all these people
have in common is that they know
computers.
They use computers, both in private
and at work.
The few people I have talked to, who
had a neutral opinion or a good one
about windows were completely
uninterested in computers.
How come you can say that the
consumers aren't the ones you are
defending yourself against, when
everyone is cheering the U.S.
government on. Everyone is happy and
excited every time it looks like
microsoft is about to take a big fall.
Haven't you seen the articles ? The
scores of MS jokes ?

It is obvious to a lot of people that
when you address the public it is with
the vaguest of defences. Trying to
make your unethical business tactics
sound like they are a constitutional
right. It is sad.

"Defending our right to innovate"
should be replaced by "we'll start
bugtesting our software from now on" -
then the speech might win sympathy.
