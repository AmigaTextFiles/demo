»CL0:Multimedia.
»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL2:Melting Pot. Once there was a French
group with that name, not a very
famous one. But perhaps they hit the
nail on the head with that name,
because with computers, art has taken
a quantum leap towards what is
commonly known as "multimedia" - a
word much abused for advertizing
computers for the reason that it
sounds very smart and advanced, and
besides it is very few ordinary users
who seem to know the actual meaning of
the word.

»CL0:Development.
»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL2:Multimedia productions is a
combination of several medias, or, to
some, several kinds of art, depending
on how you define art - this could
actually be any kind of art, and not
necessarily art created using
computers. In demos, we usually see
picture art and hear music - it has
been discussed whether coding is an
art, and as I see it, it is
combination of some kind of game,
aimed at making the most advanced
routines on the smallest machine, and
making the prettiest routines, of
which the lattered can be considered
art. But multimedia does not stop
»CL2:here; imagine demos incorporating live
acts, literature, and imagine that
instead of some scruffy looking
sceners (as in most wild demos) you
have top class actors, and imagine
that instead of pathetic poetry, you
have original work by a good author,
and everyone has been working
together, perhaps under a director who
from the beginning had an idea which
direction the demo should take. This
would truely be art.








»CL0:Where are we now?
»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL2:In present we are still at the pygmy
stadium regarding demo making. Simply
because the art form we define as a
demo has not been developed nearly as
far as it can get. Yes, people are
making wild demos, and Hollywood use
computers for generating movies
creating illusions beyond ones wildest
dreams. But this kind of art usually
involves thousands of people, and can
also be described as mass
entertainment, whereas the demo can be
created by very few people in the
comfort of their own home. Just like
an author can write a book, a painter
can paint a painting and a composer
can compose a piece of music. Or one
person can even do all three. This
»CL2:makes a difference which can make
demos the independent art form of the
next millenium.

















»CL0:The scenario.
»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL2:In the future computers will develop
drastically. Practically everything
will involve using computers, and
computers will very much become a part
of everyday life for many people all
over the globe. Everybody grow used to
computers, and many will start using
them for creative purposes, since the
graphics resolution, processor speed
etc. etc. will have increased so much
that it will be impossible to see if
something is created on a home
computer or by hand. The screens will
be more easy on the eye, and it will
become more common to read literature
on screen. The demo making will no
longer be centered around the coder,
it will be centered around creating
the best and most suitable designs for
the best words with the most suitable
music. Notice I mention words as the
most important media. With words, I
mean text or talking. Words has a
power that design and music does not
have, namely the power to be
immediately understood by the reader.

»CL0:Conclusion.
»CL1:--------------------------------------
»CL2:Art forms will merge and even some of
our good ideas will be remembered in
the demos. 
We made it begin, we made it happen
and we will not be forgotten. The
scene is the melting pot for future
art, available via networks in the
comfort of your own home. We created
history.
