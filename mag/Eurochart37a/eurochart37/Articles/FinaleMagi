»CL0:In times where Fishwave granted me the
'Spandimerda' award in his Seenpoint
issue 9 and in times where one coder
(read: Mavey of Potion) released at
the Astronyn'99 party a demo,64k
intro, ECS demo (!) and a 4k intro and
won all competition's except the 4k
one (he became 2nd) I am ending this
new Magical Moments corner..


Since the last issue of the Eurochart
I promised Curt Cool another edition.
Time travelled by in hyperspeed and I
am already 2 weeks late with this
corner; But I think I am still on time
to dcc it to Curt's (dragon's) lair in
Denmark.. It's already Spring 1999 !
yeay :)












»CL9:The Moral Of The Scene
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:In EC issue 35 (Two issues ago :) I
dedicated some lines to Antibyte of
Scoopex in a column. Of course people
misinterpitated what I ment with those
writings and thus I was forced to
write a rectification on that stuff..
Infact Antibyte is one of the best
coders on the scene, however he has
never coded a demo the last few years
only his truely excellent intro's,
that's why there is still an aspect
missing for him to demand the number
one throne.. In my eyes Antibyte is
really a master of putting much stuff
in only 40k :) Hope to see a demo
mostly coded by him soon..


»CL0:Talking about Scoopex, things are
going great for this group. New
acquisitions on the Amiga Scene Market
(ASM) ensured the continuation of this
group for the comming year at least.
Rumours say that they also have a PC
version of Alien 2, which could ensure
there breakthrough on the PC platform
also.. Scoopex looks like the followup
to The Black Lotus in there active
days, 1999 will tell if Scoopex can
make their ambitions a reality.. Good
Luck..







»CL9:Dan^Lemon Back To His Roots..
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Four nights prior of writing this
column, I met my old aquantence Dan of
Lemon at #amigascne. Yes the infinite
Core Design coder who released his
massive NINJA game just last
christmas.. The same person who Facet
and me brought to the airport in our
small bus after The Party 1993. (And
he still has that long hair :-)









»CL0:The thing is, and The Official
Eurochart reported it first, Dan is
back in the scene to make a new Amiga
demo. "It will be a a1200/020 demo,
but you dont need to have a powerfull
cpu to make a BEAUTIFUL demo" Dan
comments. And looking at what Nerve
Axis did with Relic, Dan is totally
right indeed..

»CL1:(I wonder if Magic suffers from
amnesia? :-) -ed.)








»CL9:Devotion Magazine Among The Living..
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:English scener Darkus founded his own
group Nautika and his own magazine
Devotion. Of course I joined his new
magazine also :) Jester of Sanity will
compose a module for the first issue,
graphics by Markus of Dual Crew &
Shining. And Alvin of Generation fame
joined the staff also.. Watch out
dudes!









»CL9:Epiloque
»CL7:--------------------------------------
»CL0:The Final until the next one.. How
many Eurochart issues will be released
before Depth hands there legacy to a
new group? How many more
corners/columns can I write before
Curt isn't a student anymore.. It's
just for 1999 to find out. Rest me to
say that Nerve Axis will win The Party
1999, as they will not compete at
Assembly this year but they will wait
until The Party.. (Source: MeSoN of
Nerve Axis)
Buzka and Good Night!
