Greetings folks.

Well, who can say that Nukleus and Void don't listen to their
customers? Here's a newly released and changed Versus issue three
for all those who thought the original issue three was hard to read
with it's background.

And while I have your attention, remember that Void will soon release
issue four of Saxonia, one of the few mags left on the Amigascene. If
you plan to contribute, you better do so now, as I won't say a word
when the release is due, I will simply put together what I have and
release it. There's no point in nagging, I shouldn't have to.

Also, if you are a graphician and looking for a group to join, consider
contacting Void at rumrunner@sensewave.com, rumrunner@rumrunner.mine.nu
or by other means. We are looking for graphicians, so there's a good
chance you can join.

Rumrunner of Void - 26.th of february 2006.
