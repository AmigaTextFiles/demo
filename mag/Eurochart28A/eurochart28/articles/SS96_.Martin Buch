»CL0:  Hmm, I read with some surprise a
slagg-off of this party in »CL9:Generation
22»CL0: (though »CL9:RokDaZone»CL0:, the author of
this article, writes »CL1:'This is no
slagg-off'»CL0:, it doesn't change the fact
that it is!). I attended the party and
found it to be good. Many groups, more
demo-releases than »CL9:Assembly»CL0: and
generally good organizing. There were
(ofcourse) some problems during the
party, but the organizers did their
best to get things back on the right
track. You can't blame the organizers
that a drunk Norvegian destroyed the
big screen or that 1 of their amigas
died just before the demo-compo
started. But to get back to
»CL9:RokDaZone»CL0:'s article:
  He quotes some »CL9:Artwork»CL0:-members
saying that it was »CL1:'same as last
years' 'gamers all over'»CL0:. If it was so
shitty last year why did they come
back? He states that a party is lame
because people play games on their
computers, but for me parties is not
about comparing c2p-routines (as
Artwork seemed to think) or coding all
day long. It's a chance to meet the
guys from your group that you don't
see that often and have fun! Play
games, talk, produce demos etc. I
don't see why »CL9:RokDaZone»CL0: hates games so
much! Without them, you would be
sitting with a typewriter! Without
gamers there wouldn't be any big
parties!

  He also writes shit about the
introcompetition and suggest that
»CL9:Artwork»CL0: should have won with their
intro »CL9:'Phi'»CL0:, merely because of a
better c2p-routine??? That is the most
lame thing I ever heard! A c2p doesn't
make an intro in itself. The reason
for for »CL9:Rebels»CL0: to take the 1st place
was in my opinion that »CL9:Artwork»CL0: is
copying routines like hell to have a
new production for parties for the
sole purpose of making money. If you
think this is grasped out of thin air,
take a look at your own text: 
»CL1:  '[Rebels intro]...was enough to beat
Azure's routines, which were much the
same than some from The Gate'
»CL0:  The routines were all seen before,
only thing changed was the texture.
Azure also released an intro called
»CL9:'Fresh'»CL0: a week before (at »CL9:The Summer
Party»CL0:) for the group »CL9:Bizarre Arts»CL0:. The
intro »CL9:'Phi'»CL0: looks almost like an exact
copy of »CL9:'Fresh'»CL0:. Only thing new is the
music and the routines are shown in a
different order. Nothing else. Same
routines, same color, same intro. New
music and minimal changes doesn't make
a new intro.
  Also the great 4kb-intro from TP5
»CL9:'Dawn'»CL0: was released »CL6:AGAIN» at another
party as a 40kb intro.
  Many of the party-attenders I talked
to thought that there was too much
copying and too little work in the
intro. That was, in my opinion the
reason for the second place, despite
of the fast routines.

  At the end of this I want to say
that I have much regard for »CL9:Azure»CL0:'s
abilities as a coder and »CL9:Artwork»CL0: as a
group and this text is in no way meant
to be a personal attack on anybody,
but you can only show the same stuff
so many times before people get bored.
  As for the »CL9:South Sealand Party»CL0:: It
could have been better, it could have
been worse. But overall, I liked the
party.
  PS. I was quite amused by another
article »CL9:RokDaZOne»CL0: wrote in »CL9:Generation
#22»CL0: called: 'Skarla, the ecology
heroes'. In that one he states that
they didn't deserve to win »CL9:Saturne'96
»CL0:because some routines had been
released in an older demo from them.
So I can only say: »CL9:'Phi'»CL0: got the place
it deserved, you got all the arguments
for it in that article about »CL9:Skarla»CL0:.
