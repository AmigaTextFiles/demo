»CL0:                 Hi!
...And welcome to the first »CL9:Eurochart»
in a very long time. I'd like to
introduce myself. I'm »CL9:Cytron/Depth» - I
am the new maineditor of.............. 

      »BIG:»CL2:the Official Eurochart!!»SML:»CL0:

A lot of things have happened with the
Scene as well as with this chart.
»CL6:First of all», this chart is now an
official »CL9:Depth»-production. We plan to
make steady releases of the issues
every third month - perhaps more
often. 
»CL6:Secondly», the code has been optimized,
and ought to be 100% system- and
multitaskingfriendly by now (»CL8:It really
works!! -ed»). Our coder- »CL9:Quedax»
»CL4:[CheeringFans.8svx]» - has been
working hard to obtain this, and he
still is. This means that you are
welcome to support us with new ideas
for the code. Any idea is read! 

  Since this Internet thing keeps on
growing, we have of course decided to
have a homepage. You're welcome to pay
it a visit. Unlike some other mags,
we've decided to keep track of all the
sceners without modem. We are even
trying to make this chart fully A1200
nofast compatible. This is the ONLY
way the good ol' amiga scene will
survive and move on without skipping
all the sceners without modem. In
other terms, we're trying to make this
chart an allround production, thereby
keeping every little lamer (!)
informed about the latest (we hope!).

I'd love to bother you with a long
story about myself and my background
and so on, but I'm sure, that you all
wnat to glance at the design, the
Gallery, the articles, and of course:
the charts!! So, I'll leave you here.
If you want more of this, just read
the co-editorial, by »CL9:Curt Cool!».
Depth sincerely hope that you will
like this chart and that you will
support us in the future with lots of
votes, cliparts, fanletters etc. See
you!
