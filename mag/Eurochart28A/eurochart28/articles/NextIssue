»CL0:  The next issue of »CL1:The Official
Eurochart» will be out around in the
late days of »CL4:March» (»CL8:Yes, 1997, haw
haw, I heard you!! -ed»).
  There will be a change in the
votesheet, as it is quite clear to me
that the category »CL6:"Best Scene-Country"»
is a bit silly (I didn't know that
»CL1:Malawi» and »CL1:Andorra» were such 
famous scenecountries...).
  A »CL2:4k-intro chart» is therefore intro-
duced instead. Personally, I'm quite
fascinated when se the coders with all
their efforts and ideas that are com-
bined into a geniusly designed piece
of code, that is able to do so much at
so few lines! To encourage more coders
to try this, we therefore introduce
this new chart-section!
»CL9:We would like all you swappers and
votesheet spreaders out there to
CHANGE this in the votesheets you have
got, because votes on best scene
country won't do neither you or us any
good anymore.»
  If we don't hear anything else from
our dear readers (»CL8:yes, you! -ed»), the
other charts remain unchanged. I must
say, that I find the swapper chart a
little stupid, but this has probably
got something to do with some late
night votecounting with almost NO
names being represented twice. WHAT a
mess! Hopefully, with more votes,
everything will look different!
  Next time, we'll also offer you some


more response to letters and questions
of any kind. We hope that we can get
some kind of dialogue going with our
readers to offer them what they like.
We'll also try to slag people that
don't get the point of our simple and
well-esplained votesheet a bit more of
than this issue. I was a big fan of
»CL9:Estrup»'s (»CL8:The previous maineditor -ed»)
nice and a bit cruel way to tell
people when they had done something
wrong!! I'll walk in his footsteps,
trust me!
 And as we've told you somewhere else,
there will be a clip-art-competition
for »CL5:issue#29».




            »CL9:»BIG:Deadlines!!
»SML:»CL6:--------------------------------------»
»CL0:Deadlines are actually made to be
kept! Even though the Official
Eurochart has broken this rule a lot
of times, we have some dealines that
you have to keep in order to get your
votes/clipart etc. in »CL5:issue#29».
Here we go! :
