»CL1:Erm... You're »CL3:ugly!
»CL1:Even if you're a big famous VIS,
self-chosen scene celeb, and even if
you're a small PC game lamer, who is
sitting at a so-called "friend"'s
place not knowing whatever the fuck it
is you are reading. 

Being famous does NOT make you any
prettier, but being pretty certaianly
enhances your chances of becoming
famous.

By the way:..........................

You are also
»BIG:                                »CL3:FAT!»

»CL1:Maybe you were unaware of those facts,
but now you know. Maybe we are telling
lies about you, but it might also be
nothing but the entire truth about
life, the scene and everything you are
reading.

In fact, this is the only place where
you can find the true truth about the
scene, compared to the untrue truth,
which can be found on the internet,
and in certain diskmags, which we will
most certainly mention later on in
this section.

You can read about the »CL7:Lazur»CL1: situation
(the text was timewarped to us from an
unknown point in the future).
You can read about the blind sceners
who uses a special screen to be on the
scene.
You can read how it is, when a fat
scener goes on a diet (and you
definitely need it, you fat bastard!) 

And lots more!

You can read about all the subjects
that most mags try to avoid, and slag
off other diskmags for telling you
about...

This will, purely be the sickest, most
black-humoured section of scene
diskmag ever, and I, »CL7:Curt Cool»CL1:, will
be you wonderful host on todays small
screen text show. 

Give me an applause!

What are you doing with those rotten
eggs??? STOP THAT! That is
disgusting...

         So is this section!
