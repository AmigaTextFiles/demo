Well, if it isn't those nice credits:
First of all, »CL9:Cytron» has been studying
a hell of a lot to become an engineer,
but apart from that, he has also
been editing all the nice articles
in this wonderful »CL1:#28» of
»CL1:the official Eurochart.»
He also counted the votes manually
because the votetool isn't finisheed
yet (»CL8:it made me swear and sweat! -ed»).
To put it in another way, he did all
the hard work... (»CL8:You bet, I did! -ed»)


»CL9:Curt Cool» has been a busy beaver 
writing all those weird articles about
the scene, collecting votes, and
trying to organize some more articles,
writing the information about the 
sceners on the chart as well.

»CL9:Quedax» has been working really hard
on the code, which is now completely
system friendly, without nice search
function but with all kinds of other
things, which you can see, if you 
check out the »CL5:Help page».

»CL9:Pixie/Polka Brothers» has been busy 
painting the nice design and graphics
for us (thanks!) on his trusty A1200.

»CL9:Trip/Depth» has been busy on his AMIGA
and  Roland JD-800 writing a sonical
masterpiece entitled »CL1:Horizon Break».

And »CL9:Azazel/TBL» is the other longhaired
music dude in this issue, making
another sonical masterpiece. So »CL6:thanks»
to him from us in »CL9:Depth!»

And last, but not least (except in
modulesize ;), the last module was
composed by »CL9:Deelite/more groups,
than we care to mention here ;)».

»CL9:Bakerman» has been slaving on the
news-section which hopefully updates
you with the latest and greatest news
from our scene. (»CL8:I'll have to give him
the specs for the articles... MAN,
what a mess -ed»)

»CL9:Sanctum» and »CL9:Folcka» of »CL9:Depth» have
been busy drawing nice clip-arts for
the »CL5:Euronews»-section in their DPaints.

And »CL9:hund.» & »CL9:Sanctum» of »CL9:Depth» are the ones to
borrow scanners from various places to
scan the nice pictures in the gallery
section. (»CL8:Some of them, at least -ed»)

We also have to say thanks to
»CL9:Impact DK» for making the nice intro
(»CL2:THANKS!»).

And thanks to our »CL5:guest writers» for
this issue, namely »CL9:Melomaniac/
Independent» and »CL9:Tricktrax/Puzzle».

Thanks to »CL9:Gryzor» for letting us 
borrow some pictures of some dudes
for the chart+section.

And of course thanks to all (»CL8:all? -ed»)
the voters who made this chart
possible!
