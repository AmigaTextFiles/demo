  People have been asking me two
questions a lot lately:
-  »CL3:Will the Eurochart be released?»
and, when I had answered »CL5:"YES"» to the
first question:
-  »CL3:WHEN will it be released??»
And indeed the first release of the
»CL1:Eurochart» under the »CL9:Depth» label, the
one you are reading now was intended
for »CL7:September» or »CL7:October» release. 
Why not? Are we all just a bunch of
inactive assholes in »CL9:Depth?»
Probably, but I still think we have
been working very hard on this issue,
but then why?
It might seem easy to you to start up
an old legendary diskmag again, but

»CL2:                »BIG:NO!»

We first intended to use the old code
from issue #25 and upwards by
»CL9:Estrup/ex. Static Bytes» who was the
one nice guy who let us take over the
»CL1:Eurochart». But he had a »CL3:HD-Crash», and
so some bits of the code was lost, and
we were unable to put in those bits
again, as the code was sorely lacking
in comments.
So we had to start all over again with
»CL9:Quedax» recoding the whole lot on basis
of »CL9:Pixie/Polka B.»'s design and the old
»CL1:Eurochart», and of course those things
take time, and the code is still
lacking some functions (eg.
search-routine) which the old one
featured. But the new code is still
more system friendly... :)
And of course those functions will be
implemented in »CL5:issue #29».
Then we needed new articles, new
»CL5:votes», new »CL5:votetool», new »CL5:clip-art», new
»CL5:music» and new »CL5:Eurostats», info about
the people on the »CL5:charts» and new
photos for the »CL5:gallery». (»CL8:Excuses,
excuses... Who needs them? We HAVE
been a bit lazy, I'm afraid!! -ed»)
And all in a month or two, which is
simply impossible, as most »CL9:Depth»
members actually have a life... (wow!)
(»CL8:Liar!!! -ed»)
Anyway, this was just an explanation
which hopefully saves us answering the
same two questions over and over again
in the future, and also an advice to
budding mag-editors:
»CL4:It is not as easy as it seems!»
»PIC:Clip3.Sanctum»
