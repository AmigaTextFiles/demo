  What we really need to make »CL1:the 
Official Eurochart» even better is some
photos (preferaably scanned) of all
the famous sceners for the
»CL5:Euro-Statistique». As you may have read
elsewhere in this issue, »CL9:Estrup/STB»
(The former maineditor), unfortunately
had a major HD-Crash that messed up
most of the »CL1:Eurochart», including these
pictures. It has been impossible for
us to get hold of pictures until now.
So please send us pictures, if you
have any.
