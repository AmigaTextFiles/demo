»CL1:  Once upon a time, in a rather large
kingdom called »CL4:Poland», there was a
king named »CL7:Lazur».
  He was very good at using an ancient
device called a computer for drawing,
for he was king of the computer
graphicians, and so everyone pretended
to like him because of his status of
king, which sounded like a very
powerful title.

  But what this young and talented man
did never suspect was, that some evil
powers had cast their minds on him,
because they were jealous of his
talent when it came to drawing
graphics.
Therefore they had made an evil scheme
to rid the world of him, as they put
it.

  One of them was no taller than a
large building, and just as fat,
another one was even taller and
thinner than the air itself.
  But their leader was a movie star in
a town called »CL7:Hollywood», who had lost
his mind, and therefore he had become
afraid of the colour pink, which the
young talented graphician had often
used in his pictures.
  And when his two companions in crime
heard of his fright, they decided that
he was the very man to make the very
plan, which would remove the young
king from his throne in his parents    »PIC:Clip4.Sanctum»
house, in front of his computer, which
was where he was constantly seated to
take care of his duties as king of the
graphicians, only to make room for
those two evil friends to share the
throne.
»CL0:  But oh, what was this evil scheme
all about», the reader may ask, and
that is just the question that we will
soon be answering, if you, to use an
old word, keep your ears tuned in on
this channel.
  The now ex. Hollywood star had been
doing some hard research, which, after
a long time, made him very afraid,
because the obvious amount of pink
colour in the young kings pictures,
and so he decided to put the plan into
action:



















 The plan was to »CL4:kidnap» the young king
and tell everyone he was dead, so that
they could sell his pictures to places
far away from the really big all green
and blue house where the Hollywood
star would be able to live happily for
the rest of his days, if they managed
to pull the scheme off.
  The reason for telling people about
the young kings death was of course,
or so the evil minds thought, that you
get lots more dough for pictures by
artists who are dead.

  The plan was now coming into action,
and after a long trip along the
winding and dusty road, filled with
dangers, bars, vodka and sexy girls,
the fat crook tried to get the young
king out of the house.

  What he did was this:
In those ancient times, the computer
artists used a small device called a
mouse for drawing, the mouse was
connected to the computer along with a
screen to make it possible to actually
draw on the screen.
On this little device, the evil crook
put a long piece of wire, so that he
could lead this mouse through the
house, and the plan was that young
Lazur should be lead with it, and come
outside the house, where he would wait
with a large fishing net to capture
young Lazur.

  He was giggling maniacally, standing
outside Lazurs house, which was by the
way made of pancakes, candy and other
unhealthy food, only waiting to see if
his plan could become a success.

  Unfortunatety for him, he suddenly
noticed the fact that the house made
of the sweetest candy he had ever
tasted in his life, and although he
had some trouble with actually getting
close enough to the house to grasp the
goodies, because his arms was so short
compared to his enormous belly.

»CL3:"AAHAHAHSshshhshshsssssssssss-
growlllllllllllllllmsasskkskk-
ksjjjsshhhhhs"», he said as he started
his gigantic meal, but suddenly his
happiness was stopped by the sound of
an old witch who was complaining very
loudly:
 »CL4: "You fat young bastard, you have
eaten my oven, and now I see you are
also moving onto my washing machine!
You young people today have NO manners
AT ALL."»
»CL3:  "Who are you?"» he answered, his
mouth still filled with drool and
rests of what seemed to be the
backside of a washing machine made out
of candy.

»CL4:  "I am Lazurs grandmother, and I am
the one who ate a tiny bit of his left
leg to make him very good at drawing
on screen"».
»CL3:  "Oh!"» the fat crook said. »CL3:"I see"». 
»CL3:"Can't you just eat a tiny bit of my
left leg to make me the king of the
graphicians as well"», he said, having
forgotten all about the scheme of the
Hollywood movie star and his friend.

»CL4:  "Nah!"», she answered. »CL4:"It's not
clean, you fat bastard, and besides
you own me about 28 gold doughnuts for
the repairment of this house. So I
definitely won't"».

»CL3:  "But where IS the king of the
graphicians?"», he asked.
»CL4:  "Oh, somewhere about I suppose"», she
answered innocently.
»CL3:  "I heard she should be here"», he
said.
»CL4:  "Oh well, I suppose he is here
somewhere"», she said.
  And suddenly a person rapidly ran
away from the remains of the oven, and
into another small wooden house, which
they suddenly noticed about 5 meters
from where they stood.
»CL4:  "Oh, goddamnit, now he escaped
again"», the witch said. »CL4:"I really
wanted to cook him, and now you have
spoiled it, you fat bastard... And I
can't eat you, because that will
increase my cholesterol percent
dramatically"».
»CL3:  "Oh..."», the fat crook said,
somewhat startled... »CL3:"Are you really
his grandmother??"»
»CL4:  "No. Just a passing witch with a
house made of candy"», she said.
»CL3:  "Okay"», he answered, and slowly
curled himself into a ball and rolled
away over Poland, his mission failed,
because that he was too fat to get
through the door of Lazurs house.

  When the Hollywood star heard of his
failure, he became very angry, and
sent for the second crook, who was
tall and thin.

  Off he strolled, with long steps,
for his legs was about half as long as
his whole length, and that was almost
long enough to walk over small
buildings.

  He quickly reached a bridge, under
which a large monster was living, and
it asked him:
»CL5:  "Who are you???"»
He answered: »CL3:"3 goats"».
»CL5:  "Okay. I know you goats, and I had a
lot of trouble last time I tried to
eat you, so just pass... You're
probably lying, but I have lost my
contact lenses, and so I can't see
you"».
»CL3:  "Okay"», the thin tall crook
answered, and went over the bridge,
but was then run over by a low flying
airplane, which caused him some
serious pain in his left eye, so he
had to go to the local hospital to get
fixed up.

  This set him back several days in
his travel, but anyhow, he managed to
get to the still unsuspecting young
kings parents house, and he since he
had actually liked the plans that his
fat friend had made, he put a long arm
through Lazurs window, when Lazur was
sleeping on his throne, and put a
small wire on his mouse-device, and as
he had expected, Lazur thought that
the mouse had suddenly got a life of
its own.
»CL7:  "Ow"», he said »CL7:"By golly, it seems my
mouse have just got a life of its own,
doesn't it"», and out the door he ran,
and the tall crook cast a big fishing
net over him, and put him in an
underground cave, where he could draw
his pictures without anyone ever
seeing him or them.
  The Hollywood star was now put in a
mental hospital, where he lived
unhappily for the rest of his days,
but before that he just managed to
tell everyone that Lazur was dead and
sell the pictures for an enormous sum,
which his ex-wife claimed immediately.
The two crooks took over Lazurs status
as kings of the graphicians, had lots
of children and lived happily ever
after, or rather, until the fat bloke
exploded and took the thin one with
him in his death.
  Lazur kept on drawing in his
underground cave, and maybe he still
is.
  The witch had a new nice little
house made of candy, with all the home
electronics, also  made out of candy
she had always dreamed about,  and
actually ate a little girl name red
ridinghood, as well as a girl with
golden hair and 3 bears which just
happened to stroll along. Then she
lived happily ever after, and after a
while, she even became the lone
dictator of the whole universe.
