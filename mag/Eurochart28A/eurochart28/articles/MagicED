»CL1:Sometime in July 1996, I was asked to
join EC as obScenities editor.
But I turned that offer down, because
there was a Danish papermag whose
name translated into "Screwing Animals
All Day Long" which wanted me as
editor there.
A lot of hard work followed, writing,
organizing, lay-outing etc. etc.
But suddenly the publisher died, and
thus there was no papermag for me to
edit anymore!

The obvious decision followed: 

         »CL9:KILLING MYSELF!»
But then I remembered that »CL3:obScenities/
EC» had offered me a nice, albeit not
very well paid job, and so:
The obvious decision followed:

        »CL3:IT'S OBSCENITIES!»

As I have been around this AMIGA scene
for an amount of time as, I sincerely
believe that I have analyzed, decoded
and disanalyzed the concept behind the
scene to the max. (and reached the
entirely wrong conclusions -ed.).
I have been writing for 6 years now
(with no breaks), and I have been in
the scene for almost 4. Time goes by,
things change (get more expensive,
that is), but I still like myself a
great deal more than most other people
like me.
In my writing years I have been the
editor of "Skulderbladet" (the
shoulder blade, magazine) for about a
week in 1991, and I have also
contributed a great deal to "Den Lige
Linie" (The Straight Line) which is
the school magazine at my old school.
I also wrote some articles for some
diskmagazines, one was called
AppelZinet, but it was never released.
I also wrote some other mag articles,
but that is unimportant.
Well, aren't you just the luckiest of
guys to know all those exhilerating
facts about my past?
You hope that my stay at obScenities
will be a short-lasting one (it won't,
I have a gun pointed at the publishers
head), but at least I can please you
with the fact that it might be my last
job. 
No more magic magazines, no more this,
no more that, no more true stories
about me, nor my sex life.
Sorry to all the guys I promised not
to write anything at all, sometimes
the urge just overwhelms me.
»CL0:Life goes on, and fucking is great.»
Now fuck off. Until the next issue
anyway!
This special issue (to me) is
dedicated to all my non-scene friends
(who??? -ed.), because I know for a
fact that they will never read it!

(now compare this with Magics
editorial in Showtime #4... :)
