»CL1:
   Welcome to "»CL0:The Official EuroChart
Developer Docs»". This text is written
by me the coder,for thoose people who
wants to know whats  behind the Euro-
Chart surface. The things thats going
to be  covered in  this doc  are such
stuff as clipart sizes & nr of colors
in the different parts of the EC. The
used text formatting codes etc...
»CL7:
The source code of the EuroChart goes
around  »CL6:6100» lines of  assembler code
(replayer not included).
»CL7:None of  the old  original  EuroChart
code have been used...
Please note that »CL6:no assigns» are needed




to run »CL6:The EuroChart»  from your hard-
drive...
»CL1:
Its »CL0:99,99% system  friendly» (the only
thing who hits the  hardware directly
is the module  replayer routine). The
music routines  will  try to allocate
the audio  channels each  time one of
the included  modules starts  to play
(if allocation fails it will keep its
silence.) & dealloc  them as soon the
module pauses/stops.
»CL7:
Its screen is dragable & will even be
shown in  doublePal  if possible  (No
need to use screen promotors here»CL6::-)»).
»CL1:All the clipart  is loaded as standard
iff-ilbm files. That also goes for the
gallery section...
»CL7:
By the way... Windows »CL6:vs» Workbench
coding I can only say one thing »CL6:Windows
suxx» (I've tried  it for a while on my
PC). Its  one big mess,  everything in
it fills atleast  5-10 times more than
on the Amiga. The BMP gfx format suxx.
Each pxl  allmost always  gets a long-
word ($00RRGGBB), it  can also contain
a color table  like an iff  ilbm file,
but thats hardly  never used. Its all-
most ok (except  the empty  byte) as a
true color  format. But totally »CL6:stupid»
if you're only using 256 or 16 colors,
of course they're proud of it.

»CL1:All windows pop to front as soon they'
re touched (try to  use a doc text to-
gether with  the application).  If you
dont like their  »CL0:infamous» "Start" bot-
tom, bad  luck, its almost  impossible
to use  the drawer  windows as  on the
Amiga because they dont  got their own
screen & you will have to minimize all
the program windows  to ever see them.
They all share the same screen,proper-
ly another »CL0:genius  idea» by »CL0:Bill Gates».
& for all  you graphicians  out there,
just  try to  use a  standard  palette
requester (Oh yes, they did managed to
make it that »CL0:bad»).
»CL7:
I can only  say one  more thing,  just
try to program Windows  programs & you
will discover  why it atleast  takes a
»CL6:100MHz» pentium. & try to program Amiga
system friendly code to see why it on-
ly needs  a »CL6:14MHz» 68020  to run better
»CL6::-)»...
»CL0:
NB: »CL1:Have you ever seen an Amiga emula-
tor on  the PC (I  have, on  my 150MHz 
Pentium) It goes like a 1-3 MHz Amiga,
even the mousepointer  »CL0:flickers» across
the screen (what else on a lame PC)...
Well, back to the subject...
»CL7:
First  some  important about  all  the
clipart  sizes, the width  should all-
ways be on »CL6:16 pixels boundaries»(eg:16,
32,64,112...160...256 etc). The reason
to this is because the system blitting
routines I use,demand the data at »CL6:word»
sizes.  Like the  picture in  the next
column.



       »PIC:Develop01»






»CL1:
In the  »CL0:best» situation  it looks  like
below.  (Word  aligned  anyway,  black
right side thanks to some drawing pro-
grams save methods).
         »PIC:Develop02»





»CL7:
In the »CL6:worst» times it all crashes in a
»CL7:guru... (Not word aligned).

»CL1:But  now  lets look at  the  different
parts of the »CL0:EuroChart».















»CL8:       The EuroChart Section»CL7:
The pictures  shouldn't extend  128*50
pixels  in up  to 7  bitplanes  (1-128
colors). Said in an  another way, they
should be small...
»CL1:
Like this »CL0:fabulous» picture below...

       »PIC:Develop00»


»CL7:
                         € This is a
                           »CL6:fabulous»
                           picture!

              ‚
       Its »CL6:128*50» pixels


»CL8:         The EuroNews Section»CL7:
The largest clipart size is »CL6:640*189» in
up to 7 bitplanes  (1-128 colors). But
of course  they shouldn't  be at  this
size (They should be 639*188 »CL6::-)»).
»CL4:
            Developer Info»CL1:
The topbar size is            640*27*6
The bottom area               640*93*6
Background pattern sizes      64*189*5
»CL7:
Gadgets in the  bottom area can be any
size. (System routines rulez!!!).
»CL4:
About columns»CL1:
The column  width is  suggested  to (&
should be)38 chars for the small font,
the big  font about  25 chars.  Theres
room for 20  lines of  text. This goes
for both fonts...
»CL4:About only 1 column»CL7:
Currently  if you  only want  1 column
you need  to write  the (max 80 chars)
column as the 1. column & then let the
2. column consist of blank chars (Just
hit the <»CL6:return»> key 20 times).

By the way, all codes  must start with
a '»CL0:…»' character.











»CL8:         The EuroGallery Section»CL1:
The pictures largest sizes are »CL0:640*134»
pixels in 1-7 planes (1-128 colors).
»CL4:
            Developer Info»CL7:
The topbar size is            640*27*6
The bottom area               640*93*6
»CL1:
Gadgets in the bottom area can be any
size. (Long live  system routines»CL0::-)»).

»CL7:The Text area in bottom area should be
able to contain »CL6:3» lines of text(around
386*38 pixels).
