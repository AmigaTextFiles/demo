»CL6:--------------------------------------»
  As I see it, very few sceners are
interested in advertising (and paying
for it) in productions like these. As
you can see, I've only included two
adds, and one of them is for our own
board. Therefore, it will no longer
cost anything to advertise in »CL1:the
Official Eurochart». BUT, I strongly
encourage you to edit your adverts
before sending them to me. I'll waste
them immidiately, if they bug up in
the chartsection. So, read the doc
about articleformats, and I'll include
your ad. (»CL8:Of course, if it turns out,
that there's big interest for the
advertising idea annyway, It'll cost!)»

»CL4:             Subscribing:»
»CL6:--------------------------------------»
 If anybody wants to subscripe for »CL1:the
Official Eurochart», they should
contact me (see »CL3:adresses»). I'd like to
see if there's interest for such
things even today. If there is, I'll
arrange some kind of payment method.
Prices will be fair, meaning I will
try to make my profit as small as
possible. So, please contact me, if
you want to have the newest issue of
»CL1:the Official Eurochart» as the first
ones. (»CL8:Perhaps I should send it by
snailmail to the subscripers, so that
they will get it before it is released
at the Inet.. hehe!»)

»CL4:            Competitions:»
»CL6:--------------------------------------»
  As far as I know, »CL9:Curt Cool» is
currently making a »CL2:clipart compo». You
will be able to read more about that
one somewhere else in this section.
»CL1:The Official Eurochart» will of course
maintain »CL4:the good old tradition»
with competitions every issue, also
»CL6:with prizes for winners» etc. By now, I
can already tell you, that there will
be a REAL hard »CL2:Scenequiz» in one of
the next issues. 20 hard questions
invovling »CL9:the Scene from 1988-1996»,
made by »CL9:Allan0n/Depth». Stay tuned!
Allright, that's about it! »CL9:SUPPORT US»,
and we'll steadily support you with a
great chart!
