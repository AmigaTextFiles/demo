                   »CL6:--------------------------------------»

»CL0:Since we have received very little
clip-art for this issue, we have
decided to initiate a clip-art
competition for next issue, »CL5:#29».
The format of the clip-art should be
up to 128 colours (that's 7 bitplanes
to you, m8), the biggest size is
640*189 in hi-res, but of course they
should be lots smaller than this. (have
a look at the clip-art in this issue
for help... ;)
Both numbers in the resolution should
be »CL2:dividable by 16.» (will save us some
work... :)






You should send your clip-art for the
competition to me (»CL9:Curt Cool». »CL8:Check
out his adress(es) in Adresses!! -ed»)

When we receive your clip-art, a
grand jury consisting of various
»CL9:Depth»- members will select the
best entries, and the artists behind
these will receive a great big huge
prize which will not be revealed here.
(there IS a prize, have no worries ;-)
