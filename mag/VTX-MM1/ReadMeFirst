MOON MONKEY DISKMAG - Issue #1 27/05/99
-------------------------------------------

Well here it is guys! The first issue of the new Diskmag from Vortex -
called "Moon Monkey"!


Couple of notes:
----------------

You MUST double click on the InstallFont icon first - this will copy PlayPac
Font to your FONTS: dir.

If you find any bugs (and there are many, I'm sure) - then email me the info
about them. Also if the mag works on your setup email me with your details -
Mine is A1200 030/50 16Meg RAM - So it works fine on that. I'd especially
be interested to know if it works on Graphics Cards.

Any constructive criticism would also be appriciated!

MOST IMPORTANTLY - Send me your articles <djjs@st-andrews.ac.uk> Subject:
Article - Ask anyone who might be interested to contribute! Articles can be
about anything! In raw ASCII atm only please!
