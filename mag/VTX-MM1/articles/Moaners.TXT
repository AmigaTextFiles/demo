MOANERS





By Case/Vortex



   One of the things in this life which really annoys me is moaners.
What I mean by that is those people who seem to enjoy spending their time
complaining about things. You know the sort - people who write in to
television stations saying such and such a programme had too much swearing
or nudity.

  I have two words to say to that type of person - TURN OVER. It fails me
completely why if a moaner is not enjoying a film for example, they don't
just change channel. Instead they watch the programme in it's entirety just
to give them more to complain about.

   I suppose Mary Whitehouse is the kind of person I'm talking about.
Incidentally does anyone remember "The Mary Whitehouse Experience" comedy
series which was on BBC2 about 6 years ago. Great stuff.

   Anyway my problem with these people is the danger that they can sometimes
have an influence, especially when they group together (which they
invariably do - probably to have a moaning convention or something). I think
swearing in a lot of programmes makes them more realistic. If a real person
were in situations films place them in, I'm sure the odd expletive would pop
out. As for nudity... well I don't mind a bit of it :)

   I'm sure this is one of the causes of the state of children's TV these
days. Where has all the violence gone? Where have great shows like
"Transformers", "The A-Team", etc gone? Children's TV seems to consist of
all politically correct shows trying to educate kids and weave moral issues
into every episode. Lets face it - after a day at school the last thing the
poor kid wants is more education.

   My conclusion about moaners is that they do so because in their sad
little lives there is nothing else for them to do. They think that it gives
them some sort of importance.
