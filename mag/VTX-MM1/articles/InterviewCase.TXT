Case: Well hello there Case, me old mucker, how's it going?

!code=069000
Case: Okay apart from all the shitty Uni work I'm doing atm- God will I
      ever be done with bloody maths?!

!code=120000
Case: Yes well, anyway - can you tell us a bit about your role in Vortex?

!code=069000
Case: Certainly, old chap. Well it all started about 2 years ago, I had
      only been in the Amiga scene for a few months (but I'd had an Amiga
      (My trusty A1200) for years). I was in a very small scene group
      called "The Invaders". I read issues of "The Word" from NFA and
      Carnage, and got in contact with various traders.

      One of these lucky fellows was the mighty Brainlord of Carnage. We
      got on well and traded loads of stuff by disk. One night while on
      the phone, we had the idea of staring up our own group, both of us
      wanting a change from our current groups. Brainlord changed his nick
      to Stelf and had the idea of the name "Vortex".

Case: I see... So it was just you and the wee lad in those days?

!code=069000
Case: That's right, miladdio, but soon after we started recruiting members,
      Stelf set up a Vortex web page - things were going well.

!code=120000
Case: Then what happened?

!code=069000
Case: Well it just continued like that, really. We have now had 5 releases,
      With many more on the way. The future looks very rosy for Vortex.

!code=120000
Case: Thank-You and Goodnight.

!code=069000
Case: Nps. Don't forget that half bottle of Vodka on the way out.

!code=120000
Case: Er.. thanks... bye.
