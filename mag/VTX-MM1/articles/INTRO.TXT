INTRODUCTION




MAY 1999

Hello and Welcome, one and all to the first issue of this great big hose
beast which is "Moon Monkey".

Issue one is really a test issue - There will be a lot of changes by the
time issue two comes out. Any improvements you can think of should be
emailed to one of the vortex members.

From the outset, I'd like to say that this is your magazine - what I mean
is that without the readers, Moon Monkey is pointless! So any articles you
can send in, on ANY subject (no matter how bizarre ;)  are appriciated.

Your article will be almost guarenteed to be included - it would have to be
pretty damn offensive not to!

Email your articles to djjs@st-andrews.ac.uk with the subject "Article".
(That way they wont get lost amongst the masses of junk mail I get Cheers!)

Well being the first issue, it is a bit dry on articles and subjects. I
hope to increase the number of articles every issue. If this issue has a
slightly 'unfinished' feel to it :) then that is because it is being
released in a bit of a rush before I leave my Amiga for 3 months. Ah well.

So if you have any new subjects, or if there are replies to articles then
send em in for the next issue which will be released sometime in September.

And if you think you can write better articles then why don't you?
