An engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. St. Peter checks his
folder and says, "Ah, you're an engineer -- you're in the wrong place."
St. Peter sends the engineer to the gates of hell instead and Satan lets
him in.

Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort
in hell and starts designing and building improvements. After a while,
they've got air conditioning, flush toilets and escalators, and the
engineer is a pretty popular guy.

One day God calls Satan on the telephone and says with a sneer, "So,
how's it going down there in hell?" Satan replies, "Hey, things are
going great. We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators,
and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next."
God replies, "What??? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake -- he
should never have gotten down there; send him up here."
Satan says, "No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm
keeping him."
God says, "Send him back up here or I'll sue."
Satan laughs uproariously and answers, "Yeah, right. And just where are
YOU going to get a lawyer?"

St. Peter meets Mother Theresa at the Gates Of Heaven and says, "You
were a good woman. I'm giving you a nice halo."  Mother Theresa is
walking around Heaven when she sees Princess Di, and the Princess has a
much bigger halo. Mother Theresa goes back to St. Peter and says, "St.
Peter, I spent most of my adult life helping the poor and the sickly.
Princess Di did no where near the amount of charitable work I did.  Why
does she have a bigger halo?" St. Peter says, "That's not a halo.
That's a steering wheel."

A blonde walks up to a Coke machine in a Las Vegas casino, puts in a
few coins, and out pops a Coke.  She puts some more coins into the machine,
and another can of coke pops out.  She keeps putting in coins, and cans
of coke keep coming out.  A guy walks up behind her and says, "Can I
please use the machine?" The blonde says, "F--- off! Can't you see I'm
winning?"

 Five surgeons were taking a coffee break and were discussing their work.

      The first said, "I think accountants are the easiest to operate on.
      You open them up and everything inside is numbered."

      The second said, "I think librarians are the easiest to operate on.
      You open them up and everything inside is in alphabetical order."

      The third said, "I like to operate on electricians.  You open them
      up and everything inside is color-coded."

      The fourth surgeon said, "I like to operate on lawyers.  They're
      heartless, spineless, and gutless.  Plus their heads and butts are
      interchangeable."

      The fifth surgeon said, "I like engineers ... they UNDERSTAND when
      you have a few parts left over at the end."

Two engineering students meet on campus one day. The first engineer
calls out to the other, "Hey -- Nice bike! Where did you get it?"
"Well," replies the other, "I was walking to class the other day
when this pretty, young co-ed rides up on this bike. She jumps off,
takes off all of her clothes, and says 'You can have ANYTHING you
want!!'"
"Good choice," says the first, "her clothes wouldn't have fitted you
anyway."

Q&A: THE PENTIUM FDIV BUG

Q: How many Pentium designers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
A: 1.99904274017, but that's close enough for non-technical people.

Q: What do you get when you cross a Pentium PC with a research grant?
A: A mad scientist.

Q: What's another name for the "Intel Inside" sticker they put on Pentiums?
A: Warning label.

Q: What do you call a series of FDIV instructions on a Pentium?
A: Successive approximations.

Q: Complete the following word analogy: Add is to Subtract as Multiply is to:

1.Divide
2.ROUND
3.RANDOM
4.On a Pentium, all of the above

A: Number 4.

Q: What algorithm did Intel use in the Pentium's floating point divider?
A: "Life is like a box of chocolates." (Source: F. Gump of Intel)

Q: Why didn't Intel call the Pentium the 586?
A: Because they added 486 and 100 on the first Pentium and got 585.999983605.
