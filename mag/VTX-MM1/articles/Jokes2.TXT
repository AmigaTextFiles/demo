in the first place.

Sand:PC Drug of Choice
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Anonymous Press) In Washington today, members of the House Anti-Intelligence
Committee proposed legislation outlawing the manufacture and sale of Sand.

Sand, known to experts as Random Access Memory or Megs is the first such "PC
Drug" that has come under attack from the legislature.

Studies presented showed clearly that Sand has a narcotic effect on the PC,
expanding its conciousness and allowing it to perform at a much higher
capacity for a limited time. Over time, however, more and more Sand is needed
if the PC is to maintain its ability to compete in the marketplace.

Skeptics argue that Sand is necessary as a treatment for a very common group
of PC degenerative conditions which are known in the singular as an OS
(pronounced oh ess). The worst and most widespread of these ailments,
Windows, infects nearly 80% of all working computers in the US. Banning Sand
from the marketplace, they claim, would unnecessarily endanger the lives of
these millions of PC's and other systems.

"We cannot neglect the fact that RAM is a necessary resource without which
our PC's cannot continue to function" says independant consultant Penny
Simms. "The removal of RAM would bring our entire information age culture to
a grinding halt."

"Sand, AKA RAM, is one of the greatest dangers facing our nation" responds
Rep. Richard Head. "Instead of draining our national pocketbook addressing
the symptoms, we should address the causes of these disabling conditions.
With education and research we can seek to arrest, prevent, and control the
spread of OS's and eventually find a cure." He went on to say that he
envisions a future where no computer would suffer the burden of an OS. He
also announced that he plans to introduce legislation extending suffrage and
benefits to the "unheard legions of silicon assistants".

California has announced its intention to draft its own legislation to
gaurantee the medicinal uses of RAM to its resident and alien computers, thus
coming under fire from the federal government.
