Napalm





When Dune2 was released on the Amiga and PC it had amazing success. It took
elements from turn based war games and introduced them to the exploding,
shoot-everything-in-sight world of arcade games, providing a near perfect
mix of strategy and arcade action.

After that, the PC saw hundreds of Real-Time-Strategy games as they were now
called. Especially "Command and Conquer" and it's sequels - coming from the
very same Westwood studios who produced Dune2.

Where was the Amiga conversion? Westwood deemed it unviable and we had to
listen to the rants of PC owners about how good these games were.

Well now we have "Napalm" - produced by Clickboom. It is an original RTS
game for the Amiga. How would it match up to similar PC titles.

The idea of the game, just in case you didn't know is to defeat the
opposition by (usually) destroying their base. You mine for Oil to make
money to buy more weapons, soldiers etc. The game is split into missions,
each having it's own challenge.

Well on loading up the presentation is impressive - The graphics are
excellent, the sound is good. This is just the intro screens.

When you get into the meat of playing the game, It provides a good
challenge. The first few levels introduce you to some of the tactics of
how to play the missions, and seem quite easy.

As you get further into the game, the missions become (much) more difficult.
This is where you just have to try and try again until you blow up that
base.

The weapons you have and are up against become more impressive and more
varied.

In fact it compares very well and in many respects is actually BETTER than
Command and Conquer.

Well done Clickboom!
