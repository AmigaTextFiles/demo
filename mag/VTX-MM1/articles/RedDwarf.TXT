RED DWARF VIII




By Case


On Thursday 18th February, the latest series of Red Dwarf hit UK screens.
If like me you're a big fan of the exploits of Lister, Rimmer, Kryten &
co then you would be hoping that this series got back to some of the old
Red Dwarf qualities. RD VII was a dissapointment to many - they complained
that Kochanski (sic?) wrecked the chemistry between the team.

While I think that RD VII was very entertaining, I have to agree that it was
nothing compared to many of the other series.

So as I write, I have just seen the first episode. I have to say that I was
pleasantly surprised! Long dialogue between Lister and Rimmer reminded me of
the good old days of RD. The story was good, as were the special effects.
