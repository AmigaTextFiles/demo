No Way Dude




"No Way Dude..." #1

by 4-0

A collection of weird stories (probably 
bull) from the internet.

1)
A young lad with a blind date arranged for 
later in the evening decided to chance his 
luck and stopped by a pharmacy that 
afternoon to pick up some condoms. As usual 
in these circumstances, the lad was pretty 
nervous, and so to cover his fear he joked 
to the pharmacist about how he planned to 
"get lucky" that night. The pharmacist 
grinned and wished him luck.
That night, the teenager strolled up to his 
date's house and rang the doorbell. The 
girl's father answered the door and the 
lad's face suddenly expressed shock. "So, 
still feeling lucky?" asked the pharmacist, 
standing in the door looking angry.


2)
During the course of a biology lecture 
concerning the human reproductive system, 
the teacher mentioned that one of the major 
components of human ejaculate is fructose, 
a complex sugar. A puzzled look crossed the 
face of one of the female students and she 
quickly raised her hand and blurted out 
"Why does it taste salty then?" The class 
immediately burst into laughter and after a 
brief pause the girl realised the 
implication of her question, turned bright 
red and bolted out of the classroom.


3)
At an Iraqi wedding reception, a group of 
Sunni Muslims showed off their love for 
Saddam Hussein by stabbing themselves with 
long skewers and sticking swords into their 
abdomens. One man even shot himself in the 
stomach with a gun, watched by Saddam's 
sons Odai and Qusai.


4)
After prisoner Eddy Tansil escaped from an 
Indonesian prison, his guard admitted that 
Tansil had given him $400 but denied it was 
a bribe. On trial, he claimed that Tansil 
had rewarded him for being good at his 
jail-keeping job. "I only took the money as 
a tip," he said.
