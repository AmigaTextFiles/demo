Diskmags - Do we still need them?





By Case/Vortex



One of the the things I thought about when coding Moon Monkey was the
question "Do we really need Diskmags any more?".

Going back a few years, there were loads of diskmags about. They were a
great way for the Amiga users who were modemless(like me!) to get in touch
with the rest of the scene and find out what was going on in the land of
Miggy.

But with more and more people having access to the internet, newsgroups, and
email, It sometimes seems that the humble diskmag is of little use.

Well Moon Monkey is a project Vortex are doing out of our own spare time so
it's up to choose what things we want to try.

One of the reasons I coded the diskmag is to see if I actually could do it.
People reading these mags probably do not realise the complexity of such
a project. There are so many parts that all must work together.

I like diskmags because you don't have to be online to read them, and they
are much more flexible than html pages (although this is changing). They
don't depend on servers or connection speed.

I think there is still a place for diskmags, even in the online community.
