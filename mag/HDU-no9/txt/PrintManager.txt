===============================================
Short:    Printmanager for AmigaOS3 (39.5)
Author:   Stephan Rupprecht
Requires: AmigaOS3 or better
===============================================

PrintManager v39 is a so called printer-spooler, it intercepts all 
printer. device calls to the parallel-/serial.device and saves the 
printer specific raw data to a file. This way, programs sending data 
to the printer don't have to wait for the slow printer to continue. 
PrintManager also gives you some control over the data send to the 
printer. You can even print files directly from inside PrintManager 
using the datatypes-system. 

FEATURES
* caches only printer.device calls
* can cache all calls to parallel-/serial.device
* allows to exclude certain tasks from spooling
* nice gui which works with proportional fonts 
* files can be printed from inside Printmanager (uses datatypes.lib)
* works with datatypes.library v45 (v45 recommend, not required!)
* own FAST parallel.device (registered version only)
* localized
* after reset/crash unfinished printings are recovered
* delayed printing
* print count function
 
REQUIREMENTS
any Amiga (compatible) computer with at least AmigaOS3.0 and     
( of course )  a printer.
 
NOTE
Although this program is based on Printmanager 2.0 by Nicola 
Salmoria,  no part of the Printmanager v39 code has been taken 
from Nicolas version (it is a complete new program)!
