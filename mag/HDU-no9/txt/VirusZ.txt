Short:    VirusZ II v1.43, By G.Hoermann
Author:   Georg Hoermann
Version:  1.43 (28.02 1998)
===============================================

First thing  to mention is that VirusZ can be used  as background
program that checks memory and inserted  disks  for viruses. For
this  topic  as  for every other  specific  or  global  function, VirusZ 
offers a quite  huge amount of  user-definable settings to configure 
it as you like best.

Then you have the possibility to start different check mechanisms
for files, sectors,  vectors  and bootblocks. This  is what  you 
usually  do whenever you  received new software from friends, 
PD-disks or from a BBS.

Finally,  parts  of  VirusZ can be controlled via  ARexx and thus 
enables the user  to  interact  with  it  from programs like e.g. 
DirectoryOpus.
