==================================
Genetic Species Information Pack
==================================
The game is now virtually complete, however, it has been delayed 
a little and will probably now not reach us until late April. 
Something that has not been talked about much is the level editor 
that will be released for the game.  This won't actually be released 
at the same time as the game but shortly after.

Dottet through this article you will also find some new screenshots 
of the game, I m sure you'll agree that these look utterly brilliant. 
Anyway, enough of the chat - read the information pack below and 
if you require any further information check out the developers 
webpage which is linked at the bottom of the article.

Development on Geneitic Species is in full steam and around the 
clock, even though we have experienced some delays in it`s 
release date we are confident that this awesome 3 year project 
will be ready towards the end of April 98 with a full promotional 
release at the World of Amiga (London) in May 98. Pre-orders are 
recommended and further details can be found at the Vulcan 
website www.vulcan.co.uk with on-line ordering facilities and our 
world wide stockists list.

To fuel the excitiement and build up of this title we have released 
the following extensive information pack to clarify exactly what 
Genetic Species Offers. Enjoy!

FOREWORD
Genetic Species offers furiously invigorating and thrilling 3D action 
with texture mapping speeds never before seen on any Amiga 
entertainment title! With Atmosphere, Gameplay, Addictiveness 
and Presentation as its highest priorities you will experience the 
ultimate escapism in a violent and puzzling 3D world coupled with 
the most awesome environmental effects and imagery which are 
all proudly displayed in 256 colours at an incredible (1x1) Pixel 
Resolution using the most sophisticated Texture Mapping Engine 
to date.

In its simplest form Genetic Species requires an AGA Amiga with 
an 020 CPU, a minimum of 2mb Chip and 8Mb Fast Memory, a 
Hard Drive and a 2 x Speed CDRom Drive. With more Fast 
Memory and a Faster CPU you will soon discover that Genetic 
Species excels in visual presentation and by choosing the 
appropriate window size, you will be spoiled by blindingly fast 
action. Pushing the quality further, if you have a CyberGfx or 
Picasso96 Graphics Card then you will soon realise what the 
Amiga was made for! Graphics card users require only 0.5Mb of 
Chip Memory and a minimum of 8mb Fast Memory.
The first thing you will see is an awesome 200Mb 3D rendered 
intro animation that sets the scene and atmosphere for the 
experience that follows, in order to get the best out of the intro 
animation a 4 x Speed CDRom is recommended. Once into the 
game you are bombarded with a Visual & Audio splendour that is 
matched only by the speed, response time and gameplay. Genetic 
Species has been written in 100% assembly and for the last 3 
years has seen many talented individuals eat, sweat and sleep 
nothing else to bring you the ultimate 3D experience, so venture 
forth over the many Huge Levels and frightening locations, all of 
which Demand a High Element of Genetic Warfare and Logic Plot 
Based Puzzle Solving.

Not only will you have a horrific weapon array (for mass murder) 
at your disposal but you will also be equipped with the latest 
`In-Built Portable Probe Device` were you will be able to `Psyche` 
Travel through your Environment and even engage in `Body 
Transfers` to Assume the Identity of other Entities. For navigation 
purposes your Portable On- Screen `Alpha Map Display` with Size 
and Luminance Controls comes in very handy. The Many 
Enemies encountered are superbly rendered and all have their 
own unique `high level` artificial intelligence routines, each 
animated in true to life multiple positions and each as deadly as 
the next. And finally, Genetic Species is brought to life with a 
massive selection of High Quality Digital Sounds & Effects with 
Stereo Surround and an incredible 30 Minutes of High Quality (in 
game) CD music.

ENEMIES & CHARACTERS
* Security Soldier
An ordinary corporation security soldier wearing a light ergo suit 
which is capable of resisting a few direct hits. Security soldiers 
prowl the corridors of the base, gunning down intruders with their 
.44 pistols and they never stop to ask questions first. Their 
implants are of a low grade and they are vulnerable to probe 
attacks.

 * Security Officer
High rank Security Officers are tougher, quicker and meaner than 
ordinary soldiers. They wear upgraded ergo suits and carry the 
.44 automatic gun. Their implants are simplistic to preserve 
human intelligence and initiative. Important rooms are often only 
accessible to Security Officers.

 * Cyber Scout
The echelon of the automated defence forces. Hovering a few feet 
above the ground they are a deadly foe in deserted corridors due 
to their speed. The little human flesh and brain that remains is 
hidden within a steel case. Their implants are protected by extra 
circuitry, making it difficult to take them over without killing them.

 * Face Hugger
This genetically engineered creature has no official name. We 
believe it is a new prototype war-unit escaped from some 
laboratory, and apparently capable of breeding without artificial 
support. Being the perfect base invader it is extremely fast and its 
spitting of acid creates a very dangerous entity. They have no 
implants but their genetic control mechanisms are very vulnerable 
to entity take-overs.

 * Engineer
Otherwise know as the `Dirt Rats`, The Engineers keep the bases 
running, they wear no armour and their implants are primitive, but 
simply spotting an intruder is enough to bring them to a blood 
frenzy. If you get too close, he will try to chop you to pieces with 
his fire axe, show him mercy and kill him. Engineers are also 
needed to access some systems.

 * Commander
The commanding officer of the base is the toughest and most 
dangerous human you will come across. He throws lethal 
grenades at intruders. Some restricted areas are only accessible 
by the commander or someone carrying a commander access 
card.

 * Zombie
Zombies are the victims of evil Genetic experiments. Dragging 
their rotting limbs along, they are slow but also hard to kill. 
Silenced guns are not very powerful but zombies will happily keep 
shooting at you forever. Their implants have difficulty controlling 
the damaged brains and taking them over is often the easiest way 
to give them eternal peace.

 * Gel Man
Little know information on this abdominal creature but the Gel Man 
is another genetic creation designed for environments with 
extreme pressures.

 * Mantis
Little is know about these creatures. They seem to boast some 
kind of Psi-weapon.

 * Mechanoid
Strong defensive units carrying lethal flechette guns. 90% of their 
bodies have been mechanised and armoured to take a 
phenomenal amount of damage. Their implants are strong, and a 
PPD attack without stunning will leave them severely damaged. 
Notice that they are limited to warfare and cannot handle delicate 
objects such as keycards or small weapons.

 * Scientist
The science personnel of the laboratories. They wear no armour 
and carry weak weapons. Their implants are not designed to 
repulse a probe attack so they can easily be taken over. Some 
areas are only accessible to scientists.

 * StormTrooper
Aggressive commando troopers, specially trained to locate and kill 
intruders. The standard weapon is the laser rifle which they will 
happily use to snipe on you. Their armour is light to allow 
maximum mobility and their implants are medium grade.

 * Chameleon Soldier
The skin of the chameleon man has been altered to camouflage 
the body.This works best when he is standing still, only when 
shooting and getting hit will the camouflage field disrupt to show 
the puny human inside. The high speed assault rifle carried by 
chameleon soldiers is too dangerous to ignore, so don't. The 
implants will yield to persistent attacks.

 * Wolfhead
This biped killing machine is one of the most dangerous units 
around.Mounted on the left arm is a rocket launcher. You guessed 
it, Rocket launchers are bad for your health. Some units come with 
a Vulcan minigun instead. The controlling implants of this unit will 
only disable if stunned.

 * Space Pilot
When not piloting space ships, the pilots are in an understandably 
bad mood. The Space Pilot carries a grenade launcher which fires 
stun grenades capable of putting even the biggest brute to sleep. 
The clumsy space suit puts some restraint on his mobility, but 
protects against vacuum and probe attacks.

 * Battle Cyborg
Battle Cyborgs are enhanced, heavily armoured humans capable 
of high speed. They carry flame throwers for toasting enemies. 
Due to the exposed upper body, the implants are weak compared 
to the durability of the body.

ODDITIES
* Real-time Screen Saver Which Can Also Create Player 
Animations Direct To Disk

Max Rally Preview
===============================================

I brought you exclusive news on this game quite a while ago, well, 
now I have aquired a preview of the game.  Time for a more in 
depth look at the game....

The preview I have seen only contains a few tracks, however, 
there is enough there to give the impression that the full game will 
turn out to be quite a corker. For those of you out there that 
haven't heard about this game, it is a top-down racer, similar to 
the likes of Supercars and All Terrain Racing.  Going against the 
trend of recent Amiga releases the game only requires a 'modest' 
Amiga to run, it only requires 2Mb of memory and comes on disk 
instead of CD-ROM.

The game offers four different race types. Championship, 
Multi-player battle, multi-player race and Time trails.The action in 
very fast, almost too fast. You race around the tracks and an 
amazing speed and it is very easy to loose control of the car and 
go flying into a wall.  If you do this, your car is slowed down to 
alost a complete halt and more often or not your opponent goes 
speeding off into the distance.  This is one part of the game that I 
initally found annoying, the computer cars were too fast and I was 
often left langusishing miles behind in last place.  However, once 
you have got around the controls and have had a bit of practice 
they become a challange more then an annoyance.  Even so, the 
inclusion of different difficulty levels would be nice.

As I mentioned before, the game features four different game 
modes. Of these the one that really interests me in the time trail 
mode.  In this you can race on any of the tracks with a aim of 
beating the previous best time. In the full version these times will 
be saved to a file so you have a list of your bast times. Something 
that would be nice to go along with this is a Hall of Fame in which 
racers can combine other racers times with there own (Like the 
excellent XTR allows), this will add more incentive to improve your 
times.  If all goes to plan, I will be starting a Hall of Fame for Max 
Rally on these pages, more news on this soon.

One down point of the game is that it disables the OS and so 
doesn't allow multi-tasking.  This is not a massive problem but it 
would be nice if it did. Anyway, I'm quite looking forward to this 
game, it should be released very soon. You can find more 
information about that game at the Fortress Software Website :

  NEWS FLASH
==============================================
PPC Trauma Zero
Some of you may remember a game called Trauma Zero that I 
featured a while ago. Well I have recently heard news that a PPC 
version of the game will be written. Actual features of this are yet to 
be confirmed, however, I have heard that is will contain raytraced 
full screen 256 colour (Maybe HAM8) graphics and real time 
animated background.  More info on this when I get it...
***************
Ultra Violent Worlds
You may remember this as a game that was going to be released 
by Vulcan quite a while ago, well, it is still to see the light of day.  
The game will now be released on a multi-format CD-ROM 
containing AGA Amiga, Windows 95, Lunix and MSDOS versions.  
The programmers are still looking for a buyer for this package, any 
interested publishers out there?
***************
And last but by no means least...
SWOS tournament at the WOA. Well, this ain't so much a piece of 
news, more of a thing to see if anyone is interested.  As there is 
more then likely to be a Quake tournament at the WOA I though the 
same for the old classic SWOS could be done.  Now I haven't 
contacted the orginisers about this yet, I'm just checking to see if 
there is any interest in the idea, if so I'll take the proposal to the 
appropirate parties.  
***************
Wasted Dreams Development Re-started.
Earlier in the year Vulcan released a statement to the Amiga 
community regarding their position in the market. One thing that 
was mentioned in this statement was that the development of 
Wasted Dreams had been put on hold while the market was 
reaccessed. Well, I can now tell you that the developers have 
decided to continue with the game, this is excellent news as this 
was a game that was eagerly awaited by many Amiga owners. For 
those few people out there that do not know what Wasted Dreams 
is. Well in Vulcans words it is 'Mystery and suspence from a 
gigantic alien adventure in a violent reality'.  Basically it is an 
action/adventure type game, however, it is quite different to 
anything that has been seen on the Amiga before. The game is 
viewed from an isometric viewpoint, similar to that of Diable on the 
PC.  Over ten areas each containing many screens of action have 
to be fought through. The game offers a neat 2-player option where 
they can either co-operate or fight with eachother.
Currently the development team, Digital FX, are just busy 
roto-scoping the last few charactors for the game. They are also in 
the process of recording over 350Mb of digital actor speech to be 
implemented into the game. Currently Vulcan are hoping for a May 
'98 release.

Worms Updates Out Soon.
Below is a post that was recently made to the 
comp.sys.amiga.games newsgroup on Usenet.  It would seem that 
Andy Davidson is (at last :p) going to finish of the updates to the 
worms series of games, read below for full details. Now things are a 
bit less hectic here at Team17 a bit ( only a bit though ). I'll have 
some time to hopefully finish off the patches for Amiga 
Worms/WormsDC this week and next week. There are 3 of them : 
One for the Amiga Worms (ECS), which doesn't default to joypad 
on machines with cd drives, is more stable, has a few other 
changes which I can't remember, and removes the protection.  This 
was the last version of Worms before it went AGA - I found the old 
files and got it running again, after my Amiga being set up for 
WormsDC for the last few years.  It will also be packed with an 
040/060 friendly packer. A WormsDC upgrade for all Amigas - 
Option Set loading fixed, all other small obscure bugs fixed (like 
dynamite replays occasionally going wrong), keyboard can be used 
to enter names when using joypad, both mouse+joypad work at the 
same time on title screen, improved rope, fixed positioning/sizing of 
sleep window, rescan option to check for new levels installed while 
the game is sleeping, cursor keys scroll around in Graffiti Mode, 
cursor keys on numpad scroll around in game, normal landscapes 
can be edited in Graffiti Mode after they are generated (like 
Worms2), compatibility with MCP and runtime unpackers, TAB on 
landscape generator cycles through landscape types, multiple 
sample-sets for different teams ...  and other things that I've 
forgotten. After this upgrade all future updates will be for 
hdrive/fastram only as the game is just getting too tight to run in 
2meg and off floppies. The hdrive/fastram update will add the 
cdrom support. This is the reason for not having this done by now - 
I haven't had much time to devote to WormsDC at all, and adding 
these features makes it too big for standard machines.  I wanted to 
get a universal update done first.

5 types of WormSelect and Manual Worm Placing (from Total 
Wormage) may make it into both updates, along with some other 
stuff that isn't even in Worms2 yet. All updates will be freely 
available and posted to Aminet as soon as they are finished - like I 
said, hopefully in the next 2 weeks, but things are still pretty mad at 
the moment with Worms2, the Worms2 expansion pack and the 
top-secret non-Worms game ...

Thanks again for the support and comments from people who take 
a more realistic view of the Amiga's situation - rather than just 
endless criticism, slagging etc.  To see people on here slagging off 
a game (BlitzBombers) which was being given away free - and is 
far better than any of the post-Dynablaster alternatives (as it puts in 
more of the features of the later Bomberman games) - is just 
another example of how frustrating some Amiga owners make it for 
developers. Criticism is good, when it's constructive ...
