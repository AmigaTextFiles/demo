===============================================
Short:    Start games which need all ram from WB
Author:   Andreas.Falkenhahn@mail.regio.net
===============================================

You all know the problem: Many games/demos can`t be started 
from workbench, because all of the chip memory is needed. This 
problem is fixed by dA cOOL bOOTER. Example: 
Capital Punishment.

Additionally dA cOOL bOOTER is a c00l degrader for ECS 
games/demos. Here an example: You`re able to run the old Lucas-
film games (Monkey, Indy) from workbench. This is a minor up-
date. What sounds so hard is as easy as possible...

Here are the 2 simple steps:
- start dA cOOL bOOTER
- select an executable or script

FINISHED! NOW ENJOY!

Features:
- reqtools.library (© by Niço François) support
- MWB like icons
- degrade option for ECS games/demos
- AmigaGuide documentation
