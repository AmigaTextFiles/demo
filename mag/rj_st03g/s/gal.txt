From this issue we will add a gallery. This time we inserted 22 photos.
Our goal is to publish almost one photo of all sceners present in the
various charts. Example: Dr.Skull, Juliet & Case, Azure, Danny/TBL, Lazur,
Ra, Facet, Mop, Astro, Fishwave, Gangsta/SCX, Splatterhead, Xtd, Jester,
Crusader/Giants & ED, Dave/Freezers...
A note: this disk contain also the intro of the mag, made at last minute
by modem & lanch/x-zone... it has some bugs/gfx errors since no time.
I am sorry, but a guy named Aceman/BSD, promised us to code the intro, but
after 2 (TWO) months, one day before the deadline, said: "I can't finish
the intro, no time". So modem/X-Zone made that fast intro, really thanx.
Remember this name: Aceman... in case he will ask to join your group...
