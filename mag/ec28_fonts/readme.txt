There  seems  to have been a number of problems to get the various supplied
fonts  to  work  with  EuroCharts #28.  Depth have picked up two font sets,
namely  the  SCALA  and  P0T  NOODLE  families,  and  just  renamed them to
EuroChartBig  and  EuroChartSmall.   Problem  is,  when these two fonts are
accessed by the system, the EuroChartSmall.font and EuroChartBig.font still
contain binary descriptions that refer to SCALA and P0T NOODLE!

This  archive contains a fixed set of the two main font sets; Just copy all
the content to your FONTS:  drawer and you're in business...

Merry Christmas.
