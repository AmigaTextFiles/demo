On waves of love I fly to your soul,
using my heart as a surfboard,
unbreakable, unstopable.

No wave too high to cross,
no ocean to rough to stop me,
On this ocean of clouds,
I am the master.

the king of the world,
the captain of this ship,
drowning in a sea of love,

on my way to you,
nothing can harm me,
your love is calling loud,

My feelings showing the way.
