================================================

Patch for mathieeesingbas.library Mul/Div FPU handling.
Patch for the OS copyright. 

Patch for WritePixelLine8() trashing the source.
Froze 43.4.
Fixed V39 ScreenQuiet patch.
Froze 43.5.
Added BOOL CheckIO() patch to help WB and others
Froze 43.6.

Make a copy of your old SetPatch before testing the V43 
SetPatch. The V43 SetPatch should work well with any OS >= 
V37. Please send in a short report if it WORKS WELL, too!

The CheckSetPatch.c code fragment may help some software 
developers to internally turn off workarounds for OS bugs 
conditionally. *NOTE* : prior to the December 1997 release of 
this archive, the CheckSetPatch.c function had a bug in the 
version check.
