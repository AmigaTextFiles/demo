About PoolMem:
	
If you run a lot of programs without resetting the system, you'll 
usually find that the main memory of the computer is getting 
"messed up", split in lots of tiny memory "snippets" that are more or 
less useless due to their tinyness. It may happen that you can't 
start an application even though enough memory is available - 
because this memory is too fragmentated to be of any use.

That's the point where PoolMem tries to help you : It manages the 
main memory in a way such that it can't get fragmentated too 
easely. It replaces also the function of AllocP, which is therefore 
obsolete.

Installation and Usage:

Copy the PoolMem program in this archive to the C: directory of 
your system partition. Add the following line to your startup - 
sequence:

PoolMem >NIL:

You might also want to install "PatchRAM" which is included in this 
archive, too. It modifies the system RAM disk in a way that avoids 
memory fragmentation, too. Another bonus is that the RAM disk 
will show its true size from now on, i.e. it won't be no longer 100% 
full. To remove PoolMem later on, open a shell window and enter

PoolMem remove
