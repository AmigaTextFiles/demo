Amiga Forever

The Amiga Emulator CD-ROM
Cloanto acquired from the group of owners of Amiga technology
Gateway 2000, Inc.,  Amiga International, Inc. and Amiga, Inc.) a 
license covering all Amiga operating systems from version 1.0 to 
version 3.0, to be published by Cloanto in a package named 
"Amiga Forever". (A few minor files will be missing or changed as 
agreed in this license, without affecting the emulation's Amiga 
compatibility. China and certain neighboring regions are excluded 
by the license.)

The license also covers Amiga ROMs, Amiga patents, the use of 
the "Amiga"trademark in "Amiga Forever" and "Amiga Explorer", 
the official "Powered by Amiga" logo, and other intellectual 
property and every permission required to legally publish a fully 
working Amiga emulator.

Amiga Forever includes "Amiga Explorer", a new Amiga-to-PC 
networking software developed by Cloanto. The Amiga Explorer 
user interface is an object-oriented extension to the Windows 
Desktop, where the Amiga appears as a networked computer. 
The Amiga and the PC can be connected via a serial (null 
modem) or parallel (Windows/LapLink/InterLink/Norton standard) 
cable. A future upgrade, expected to be available later this year 
(at no cost to Amiga Forever users on the Cloanto web site), will 
extend the networking capabilities to support TCP/IP.

Amiga Forever also includes a variety of famous old Amiga 
games, demos and other material of historical interest (with an 
exclusive, never before released, interview with the late Jay 
Miner, "Father of the Amiga"), plus Personal Paint and other 
up-to-date productivity software by Cloanto and other companies.

The Amiga operating systems, ROMs, and Amiga emulation 
software are preinstalled on Amiga Forever for easy use and 
installation. The user just needs to insert the CD-ROM in a PC, 
and with one mouse click a fully working Amiga will appear on the 
screen. The Amiga emulation software includes for the first time 
drivers for Picasso 96 screen modes (up to 256 colors, as well as 
16/24-bit true color modes, using an emulated graphics board), 
plus some features required for the ShapeShifterMacintosh II 
emulator to run in the Amiga emulation (sharing the emulation of 
the 68K CPU, which is not emulated twice).

The initial release of Amiga Forever is scheduled to include a 
CD-ROM with software for the Amiga and the other platforms, 
plus a floppy disk with a copy of the Amiga-side networking 
software (for Amiga systems with no CD-ROM drive). The exact 
platforms which will be supported by the emulation software, in 
addition to Windows NT, Windows 9x, DOS, Power Macintosh 
and Linux, will be defined and announced shortly. The official 
Amiga Forever web address :

http://www.cloanto.com/amiga/forever

will allow users to obtain information and support, and to easily 
upgrade their software directly from the Internet. Available since 
end of February '98 for only DM 119,-
Update v1.0 -> v2.0 only DM   50,-

Alive Mediasoft Split.

Below is a press release I recently received from Andrew Reed, a 
former director of Alive Mediasoft. It would seem that he has 
decided to go his own way a open up a new company called 
Crystal Software.  Alive Mediasoft will still continue trading, but only 
as a mail order company.

As for the games that Alive were die to publish, these will now be 
published by the news company, Crystal software.

Alive Mediasoft Ltd Press Release.
All of you know that Alive Mediasoft Ltd has obtained great respect 
in the Amiga market in the Eight months of trading. Not only from 
the  Amiga user of which Alive have as customers, but also from 
the other companies within the Amiga scene.

Within these eight months Alive has grown at an astonishing rate. 
Our customer database is in its thousands, and the amount of 
potential game developers approaching Alive mediasoft Ltd with an 
aspiration of seeing their hard work becoming a comercial game 
has increased.

Due to this success Alive Mediasoft Ltd have been placed at a 
junction in the road of its evolution. This juction puts a question 
before the four directors of Alive Mediasoft. This question was; 
Does Alive Mediasoft Ltd expand and concentrate on acheiving to 
be the best mail order company in the Amiga community or does it 
expand and become purely a publishing house ?

The answer;
This question was given serious thought by all concerned for a 
great deal of time, and the following is our answer. It was decided 
that the Amiga market does not have the kind of Mail order 
company that Alive has become, with its freindly service & staff that 
really know about the Amiga and the games that they sell. Alive 
was the first to offer a Classic Game search facility, others soon 
followed suit. Infact the Amiga market doesn't have a dedicated 
mail order company since the sad loss of Premier Mail order.

I therefore decided that I would break away from Alive Mediasoft 
Ltd to concentrate purely on publishing.

Oh No what about the Games Publishing?
Due to the decision explained above, the publishing part of Alive 
Mediasoft Ltd, myself and team, will be leaving Alive Mediasoft Ltd 
to become a dedicated publishing house under a different name.

CRYSTAL SOFTWARE

This new company will be a seperate entity from Alive Mediasoft 
Ltd. What about the forthcoming Games? All the future releases 
from Alive Mediasoft Ltd, will now be published and released by my 
new company.This includes Gilbert Goodmate, Tank Goblins, 
Arcangel, plus two new titles in early development. It also includes, 
soon to be anounced, PC licenced conversions.

Other information
I would like to make clear that this split from Alive Mediasoft Ltd is 
to allow both parties involved to become the best in what they want 
to acheive, and is no way contrary to any rumours that may be 
generated after this split is made public. I would like to think that 
you will continue to give me the level of support you have given me 
when I was part of Alive Mediasoft Ltd. As I will continue to aspire 
to bring new and great titles to the Amiga platform of computers.  
Obviously the change over is not an easy thing, and therefore some 
time will be needed to get things up and running.This time will be to 
relocate to new premises, administration work,  and to change the 
e-mail addresses and Web site. Therefore CRYSTAL SOFTWARE 
will be operating fully from 3rd March 1998.

Amiga Doom Update.

It's been quite a while since I brought you any news on the state of 
the Doom ports. Well, since this last time a lot has happened.

There are now 7 different ports in active development, of which 
two are for PPC machines.  All of these are moving along very well 
and are not only giving all of the features of the orginal doom game 
to Amiga owners but also adding new features which haven't been 
seen before. Out of the seven ports that are available now the 
most popular is ADoom. This along with Doomattack has the 
fastest 68k engine, it also contains the unqiue features of being 
also to play the game on a higher screenmode.  While all the other 
ports AND the original Lunix source only allow play in a 320x200, 
ADoom allows you to play the game in resolutions upto 
1600x1280, this looks absoloutly brilliant but is slow even on an 
060.

Most of the ports are now at such a stage of optimisation that they 
are easily playable, full screen on a basic 030/50Mhz.  Some of 
the higher ADoom resolutions are also playable on this spec 
machine allthough at least a 040 is recommended. Since Doom is 
alomst virtually made up from something called a WAD file, there 
have been many commercial and PD WADS created.  All of the 
Doom ports allow you to use these.  The Doom2, Final Doom and 
Ultimate Doom WADS are all reported to work, as are many of the 
free WADS that are available on the Internet.  This virtually gives 
you a number of different games in one.

Genetic Species Update & New Screenshots.

I'm sure all of you have heard about Genetic Species, if not, why 
not? It is one of the best looking games coming our way at the 
moment. Sadly, it has suffered some delays recently, however, this 
is only so the authors can make it as good as possible.

The most recent that most of you will have seen of this game is the 
version 3 demo that was distributed on the Amiga Format CD and 
has also been on Vulcans other CD releases. This, however, is 
quite old now and there have been a massive amount of additions 
since this was released.

The game now features around 12 different weapons including a 
plasma rifle, a flame thrower, an axe, a rocket launcher and the 
interestingly named drill weapon to name just a few. you can be 
assured, there will be no lack of tools to kill the enemy with.

While on the subject of enemy characters, there is now a total of 
around different enemys featured in the game. These range from 
the plain old corpes to the weird looking huggers. The graphics 
engine has had a lot of work done on it, especially for specific 
processors. The game is running fast on just a resonable Amiga 
configuration now, and if you have a high powered Amiga you are 
in for an excellent experience. The graphics engine boasts such 
things as texture reflection/refraction, distance shading, shot 
lightsourcing and much more.

Another aspect that has been improved on is the enemy AI. This 
has received a lot of work to make it as realistic as possible.  
Things such as Retreat, Hide, Roam and group fighting have been 
added to make the enemy as hard as possible to beat, you won't 
find stupid enemys that just stand there waiting for you to kill them 
in this game. Other things that has been implemented includes 
speech samples, introduction of the probe takeover system, 
support for 3 button mice ( There is joystick and keyboard support 
too ) and much more. Currently the game is looking like being 
released sometime on March although this is yet to be confirmed.

The Genetic Species version 3 demo has finally been released on 
Aminet.  It was formally only available from the Amiga Format CD 
christmas edition or on Vulcans CD game releases.  Although the 
demo has only just been released, it is already quite old, for more 
information look at the update I done on the game last week. At the 
moment the game is looking like being released in early March.

Scrap Metal
You may not have heard much about this game, it is a Command & 
Conquer games in development by Desktop Corruption (The same 
people behinf Dafel: Bloodline). Anyway, I was due to be bringing 
you news on it a while ago, however, there were problems with the 
coder of the game.  This has now been sorted so look out for news 
regarding the game soon.

Great Nations
You may remember this from a feature I done on it a while ago.  
For those that do not know, it is a Civilization clone, with a major 
difference, it can be played online.  Anyway, there has been a new 
demo of it released recently and it is looking very good.  

Max Rally
I have just received a playable demo of this game, first impressions 
are quite good, I will let you know what I think after I have had 
more time to look at it. 

MegaBlast
This is a game that has already been released by APC&TCP and 
will soon be released by Islona in the Uk.  It is a Bomberman type 
game, as for if it reaches the heights that Blitzbombers has - we'll 
have to wait and see.

Thats it for now....
