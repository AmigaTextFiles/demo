AIFF is an acronym for "Audio Interchange File Format". This file 
format was devised by Apple Computer, Inc. and a number of third 
party developers. It is mostly used on Apple Computers, such as 
the notorious Apple II, Apple IIGS and the Apple Macintosh. With 
the introduction of System 7 the Sound Manager was enhanced to 
support direct playback of "AIFF" and "AIFC" format files, thus 
making this file format an integral part of the Macintosh operating 
system. Most digital sound recording software on the Apple 
Macintosh supports "AIFF" as the native sound file format. Rather 
recently, "AIFF" was adopted for use with Kodak Portfolio CDs 
since the corresponding development software is largely 
Macintosh-based.

"AIFF" and its `sister format' "AIFC" are in many ways similar to 
the "8SVX" IFF format which is commonly used on the Amiga. 
Both are stored in IFF format, can contain sampled sound data 
and offer means to store musical instrument data. Unlike "8SVX" it 
provides additional services, such as MIDI support, data markers 
and audio recording information. Sampled sound data is stored 
interleaved for multiple channels, making it easy to replay stereo 
sound. Samples do not need to be eight bits wide, such as 
required by the "8SVX" format. In fact, they can be anything from 
1-32 bits wide.

While both "AIFF" and "AIFC" share the IFF file structure and thus 
are designed as interchangeable file formats to be used on many 
computer platforms Apple Computer, Inc. added data 
compression support to "AIFC". As always, all the standard data 
compression methods are based upon proprietary algorithms to 
which Apple Computer, Inc. probably holds patents and is 
unwilling to share. In essence, this restricts the portability of 
compressed "AIFC" files which violates the essential idea behind 
the IFF concept. To do it right, a new chunk would have had to be 
added to the original "AIFF" format description. 

Installation
The "AIFF" datatype distribution should consist of the following 
files: aiff.datatype, AIFF, AIFF.info, AIFF.guide, AIFF.guide.info, 
Source code (in the "source" drawer). 

Copy the file "aiff.datatype" into the "SYS:Classes/DataTypes" 
drawer. The "AIFF" and "AIFF.info" files should be placed in the 
"DEVS:DataTypes" drawer. In order to use the datatype you will 
need to reboot the machine.
