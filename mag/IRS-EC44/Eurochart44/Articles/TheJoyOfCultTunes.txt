»CL1:Yes, I discovered some heart  breaking
stuff the other day. I found  out that
the  passion  and  devotion to modules
had a deeper  meaning. »CL8:They are simply
put on earth to  make  people like you
and me happy or  even  help us through
tough times»CL1:.  You  just  need  a  good
collection of modules. That  is  truly
all you need. Then  you  can  find the
module that suits  the mood you are in
on the current day.









I am sure that some (not sceners)  are
aware of  this  already  and they have
used music for ages  to  enhance their
emotions. If you  are sad  and  listen
to a melancholic  module, you  can  be
sure that your emotion will  not  fade
away, but stay and in some  cases even
be  enhanced  and  the  same  goes for
happiness. »CL6:So  why  not  use  a great,
cheap tool like music  instead of  all
these  pills»CL1:.  (Or  what  do  you say,
Darkhawk?)
So  after  ten  years  with  the Amiga
platform  and   after   thousands   of
modules, why now? I  do  not  know.  I
guess  that  »CL7:I  never  really  thought
about it  until  now.»CL1:  Maybe  I  never
really  cared  about   it,  because  I
always had four-channel  music  around
me. So I never learned to  respect the
power of music. However, »CL8:I can  assure
you  that a HD  crash make such things
really clear»CL1:! It is just  like a drug,
if  you  do  not  have  it.  Then  you
really want it.

Sure, I  tried  to  listen to  some of
these modern CDs. And remember, we are
talking   about  real CDs,  not  MP3's
(»CL6:030 Rules»CL1:). However, I could not feel
the beat in those songs. They  were to
fancy  for  me,  I  guess.   To   many
channels, Too much everything. What do
you do? You  go get  some  really  old
techno CDs  and   see   if   there  is
anything  on them! And  I  got  lucky!

Then it hit me! Okay, it hit one of my
friends :) and »CL8:he asked me if I really
liked  that  kind   of  noisy   music!
I answered: "Yes of course, it is  the
best." He  said: "But it  sounds  like
old C64 music, noisy and loud"»CL1:. It was
then I  realized  that  I  am  a  very
special person who has  something that
not many people have on this planet! I
have taste, and in my opinion  a  good
one, even  though  I  know  that  many
people   say    that   I   am   crazy.

Sure  this  might  be  true, because I
have said and done some really  stupid
and crazy things in my past.  But  the
fact is  that  I  have a collection of
music that makes  me feel  better  and
that is the most important thing after
all.  SID, ATX, MOD, DBM,  MP3, XT  or
whatever the format.

But, this article is for sceners and I
think that most sceners has some  kind
of module collection, some bigger than
others. »CL8:Try to take  a  closer look on
those modules you choose to  play next
time and try  to  compare  them to the
mood you are in at the time»CL1:. I am sure
that you  will  find  some  points  of
resemblance.

Ending words. Do not forget to use the
power  of  four-channel music  in your
everyday life.
