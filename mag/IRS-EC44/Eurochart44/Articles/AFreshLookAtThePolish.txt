»CL1:Being a swapper, I would like to say a
few words about  the  situation of the
Polish  swappers.  »CL6:Poland  »CL1:has  always
been called »CL6:"The land of the swappers"»CL1:
and this  is the truth.  Our  swappers
are   fast,   friendly,    and    know
everything  there  is  to  know  about
swapping.  However, this only  applies
when they  are  in fact swappers! What
am I talking about? Let us have a look
at   the     Eurocharts     list    of
"Best swappers".








We will see number five,  Azzaro  from
Mawi & Flopi. People, I  would like to
tell the whole world  and every scener
and swapper  that  he  is not swapping
anymore!!!  He   is   a graphician  or
something.  He  replied  to  my letter
that  he  is  so  busy  while   making
graphics, that  he  does not have much
time to answer a letter! He might be a
graphician,  editor,  compiler, but he
is not a  swapper. Now, let  us have a
look at  the lower positions; McR from
Mawi is  also  not a swapper. He makes
Zosia pack and  nothing else. He  does
not  collect  new contacts!  The  same
goes  for  Juen.  »CL6:They  are trying  to
minimize   their   swapping   and   do
something  more  interesting  instead»CL1:,
like  painting,  coding,  or likewise.
Hakon is very busy, he has a lot to do
like   compiling   Frozen,  organizing
Whelpz  and  the website. When I wrote
Hakon, he sent me an email saying that
he would answer in the nearest future.
That  was  in  February, 9 months ago!
So, what  is  the conclusion? Hakon is
not  a  swapper. I  do  not know about
Lothar, but  I  have  heard,  that  he
likes drinking vodka more than writing
a letters, so...


In  Poland,  there  are only  5-6 good
swappers,  and  they  are  mostly  not
placed on the Eurochart! I do not know
who  votes  this  way.   If  you  like
Azzaro,  McR  or   any   other  Polish
"swapper" than  send  him some flowers
or something, but do not vote for him!
It  makes   the  Eurocharts   list  of
swappers highly untrue! My own list of
active  Polish  swappers  looks   like
this:

»CL7:        Kempy »CL1:of »CL7:DCS »CL1:& »CL7:Veezya

»CL1:One of the best swappers worldwide! If
you  want  to  talk  to someone with a
»CL6:high IQ, who  knows  everything  about
the Polish demo scene»CL1:, who has/is fun,
you should  write  Kempy! That  is not
only my opinion, I think.

 »CL7:      Makak »CL1:of »CL7:Reason »CL1:& »CL7:Moons

»CL1:The second-best Polish swapper, who is
very good, has  the same high IQ (that
is very important), »CL6:is  still  active,
still swapping, still kicking»CL1:!

»CL7:      Evan »CL1:of »CL7:Mawi»CL1:,»CL7: DCS »CL1:& »CL7:Bohema

»CL1:He is a very, very good, professional,
and »CL6:friendly swapper»CL1:. He  has lots  of
advice  to  give  you,  but  sometimes
makes delays :)

»CL7:         Jackobe »CL1:of »CL7:Oxygen64

»CL1:Fine  school   of   Polish    swapping
activity. He  has  lots of  ideas, and
many words to tell you...

»CL7:     Hazh »CL1:of »CL7:Dione»CL1:, »CL7:Deputy »CL1:& »CL7:Weeds

»CL1:Maybe his style is too chaotic, but he
is very friendly, fast, and one of the
best. »CL6:He is in the army now»CL1:, but after
this long break from swapping, he will
return like a  dragon! - Or something.
Unfortunately,  »CL6:he   does  not   speak
English»CL1: :(

That  is  all  my  positions. There is
only five, because  the  rest  of  the
Polish swappers are  the same. The 6th
place I would  give  to several Polish
swappers  who  are  still   good   and
active, »CL6:but  not to Azzaro, McR, Juen,
Hakon  or  any  other  lazy, inactive,
overworked  graphician  or coder»CL1:! That
is all I have to say.
