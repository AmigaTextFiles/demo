»CL1:So  sorry, so sorry..  Ahh  yes,  once
again (for the second time, actually),
we have this  article in  the EC.  The
purpose  of  it  is  to  apologize  to
various   people     for     all   the
inconsistencies    and     errors   we
blatantly  commit   in   each   issue,
»CL8:because we cannot  be bothered  to be
professional journalists, we cannot be
bothered to do research, and we cannot
be  bothered  to  be  too objective or
accurate.. »CL1:Ahemm, we  can, however, be
bothered   to    apologize    for  our







»CL1:mistakes,  and  we  can  even admit to
these mistakes publicly,  because this
will create one  more  article for the
mag.. Uhh.. I mean..  Let us just  see
what we have of apologies to  make for
the Eurochart #43.

»CL7:First  off,  in  my  rather   big   MS
Production review, there was at  least
one  error.   »CL1:In    the    review   of
Artifictional by Secretly, while I was
evilly comparing their  3D  engine  to
something not very flattering (eheeh),
I wrote: "What reminds me of Quest are
the 'jumping' textures in Scicco's  3D
engine (..)".. No no, how  could I say
something as  preposterously  wrong as
this? Giving  the wrong guy the blame?
Stingray  wrote  me  and corrected me,
because, in  fact,  he  was  the   one
coding  the  engine,  not poor Scicco.
So, my apologies guys!

»CL8:The biggest mistake we (or ok, I  will
admit it -  it was I alone)  made, was
the thing we wrote about 3  Amigos and
Exploder, in my  MS report. »CL1:Seems like
I have  listened  too much to rumours,
without verifying them, and I am sorry
for that. I wrote  that their demo was
likely ripped from  Exploders sources,
due to various facts, but I was wrong,
it   was    a    legitimate   Exploder
production, sorry. I also  wrote  that
Exploder had sold his Amiga, and ehrr,
this was  not  true either.  I  really
should not be  listening to rumours as
uncritically  as that. Sorry Exploder!
And thanks to the people pointing this
out to me.

»CL7:Then  there  were,  as   Azzaro   also
pointed out in regards to EC 42,  some
errors in the news and grouplisting of
people.  While  I  do  not think it is
that terrible  a mistake, if we do not
know right  away  that a  scener in  4
groups joins 3  new groups and quits 2
at the same time, »CL1: it's of  course not
something we aim to do, and we  try to
be as up to date as possible, although
it might slip.  So,  for  the  sake of
completeness..

»CL1:Makak  was  not  in Terror 13 when  we
wrote he was, Reed was in  Damage  and
TRSI,  Modem  was   in   Trinity,  not
Darkage  (although  he   has  rejoined
Darkage by now), and Kempy  left Moons
a long time ago.

»CLA:                Sorry!

»CL1:If you spot an error in the EC, please
do write us about it,  because,  well,
it is way easier for you  all to  spot
these errors, and quite easy for us to
correct, so we would  appreciate  your
help, and  we  won't  feel grumpy when
you tell us we made a mistake :)
