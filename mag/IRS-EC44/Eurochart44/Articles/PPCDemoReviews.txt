»CL1:Hello  everybody  and  welcome  to  an
article  about  something  that way to
few sceners have written about. (No, I
am  not talking about Magic/Nah-Kolor.
Since 1998,  when the  PPC-cards  from
Phace5/Dce      where      introduced,
productions  have  been   written  for
those nice, but expensive turbo cards.
Personally, I became a happy PPC owner
in May 98 when the first ones arrived.
From  time  to  time,   I  have   been
watching   the  productions  using  my
monster Amiga.  Still,  the quality of







the    productions   has    not   been
discussed. The main reason is obvious,
since  only  a  minority  of the Amiga
sceners own  such  cards and those who
do have  not  written  too  much about
them either.

I have  therefore  written  my opinion
about  all  the PPC releases that have
come  out  this past  year.  The  test
machine  were  my  own  603-200/060-50
with Bvision, running AOS 3.9 with the
newest versions of WarpOS, Warp3D, and
AHI. Some of the  reviewed productions
requires faster CPU, and were  perhaps
not shown as impressive as they should
have been.  Still, I  have  gotten the
right   impression    of    what   the
intentions  behind   the   productions
were, so it should not be any problem.
Here we go:

        »CL8: Flow/Kangaroo (64K)

»CL1:Code:   »CL7:Chip
»CL1:Gfx:    »CL7:Beast
»CL1:Msx:    »CL7:Teo


»CL1:It features a quite slow real-time ray
tracer and  it is obvious that this is
more a test release then a first class
masterpiece. »CL6:Still, it has  quite soft
music and  graphics  that  works  nice
together. »CL1:So let  us  hope a  real PPC
production from  them  will show up in
the future.

»CL8: Amsterdam Blessings PPC/Mawi (Demo)

»CL1:Code:  »CL7: Kierownik
»CL1:Gfx:    »CL7:Azarro, Fame, Ubik
»CL1:Msx:    »CL7:Tzx

»CL1:Other sceners have reviewed this  one,
so I will  concentrate  on  the  speed
improvement  from  the   68k  version.
There is  no  doubt that the 60x gives
the   demo  a  major   improvement  in
benchmarking.  »CL6:All  the heavy routines
are running  so  much  faster that the
expression  sometimes changes totally.»CL1:
I would not have been surprised if the
demo had  gotten  even  more points at
Mekka/Symposium  if  this  version had
been shown at the big screen.

»CL8:         Mocap/Floppy (Demo)

»CL1:Code:   »CL7:Zig
»CL1:3d:     »CL7:Def
»CL1:Msx:    »CL7:Revisq

»CL1:This one is not a PPC  demo but a  68k
demo  that requires a  3D-accelerator.
It  was  meant  to  be  a   PPC   demo
featuring  much   more   effects   and
3D-scenes. Due to a HD-crash  one week
before  Mekka/Symposium,   the  entire
source-code  of  the  demo  was  lost.
»CL6:Therefore, it  impresses me  what  Zig
managed to  rewrite  from  scratch  in
such a short time.»CL1: Overall, it ends up
with being a  quite  short demo with a
rotating  3D logo and some scenes with
a  female  and   an    alien   dancing
together.

»CL8:         Option/Potion (64K)

»CL1:Code:  »CL7: Mavey, Diamond
»CL1:Gfx:    »CL7:Rem, Rork
»CL1:Msx:    »CL7:Skip

»CL1:After releasing their first  PPC-intro
at  Satelite 2k,  my  expectations for
this one were very high. Partly, I got
my expectations satisfied. Running the
whole  64k  in  640x480   with   heavy
real-time  retraced  3D-scenes,  great
music, and  some other stuff, it was a
deserved  winner  in  the 64k compo at
MS2k1.  »CL6:Still, it  is  far   from  the
genius  design  extravaganza  in Gift.»CL1:
It  is  more  like  those  productions
without  any  kind of  "takeoff".  The
soundtrack builds  itself and tries to
break  lose  when the last scene shows
up, but  the  visuals  do  not seem to
respond  in  the right places. Anyway,
Potion demonstrates with "Option" that
they have produced the most impressive
PPC-64k  ever  done  so far, and  that
they  have  the potential to produce a
PPC-64k  that  could  beat  "Gift"  as
well.

»CL8:  Serial Interference/Encore (Demo)

»CL1:Code:  »CL7: MDW
»CL1:Gfx:    »CL7:Caro
»CL1:Msx:    »CL7:Substance

»CL1:The brothers in Encore,  MDW and  Caro
strikes us  with their second demo for
PPC. Many  good 3D-scenes  with  great
textures, and  a  nice  tune  make the
demo very  good.  However, because  it
does  not  have  any  typical  "killer
effects", or any  kind of artificially
expressions, »CL6:it ends  up  being a more
typical  demo  that  does  not  really
separate  itself  from  the masses.»CL1: It
remains technically  good, but  way to
anonymous for what it could have been.
Overall, a nice demo worth downloading
if you got the right hardware.
»CL8:    Plus/Encore & Nah Kolor (Demo)

»CL1:Code:   »CL7:MDW
»CL1:Gfx:    »CL7:Caro, Performer, Spark
»CL1:Msx:    »CL7:Zayka

»CL1:Encore continues their PPC  adventures
with "Plus", this time  with a helping
hand  from  Nah-Kolor.  What  I  first
noticed  about "Plus"  was  that  when
compared to "Serial  Interference", it
has  much  more  varied routines, nice
and fast ones as well. »CL6:The timing with
the nice soundtrack has been improved,
which   makes  "Plus"  a   much   more
attractive  production.»CL1:   Encore   has
simply  managed  to get rid of some of
their  "problems" from  their previous
demo. Rock on!

»CL8:       Power Up/Universe (Demo)

»CL1:Code:  »CL7: Crisot
»CL1:Gfx:    »CL7:Lord
»CL1:Msx:    »CL7:Rafo

»CL1:If  there  is something  that I notice
with this demo,  it  is  the speed. It
simply runs  so %^$$#$% FAST! Although
it does not feature the  most advanced
kind of effects, or the  most  massive
screen  resolution  compared   to  the
other  productions  in this review, it
equalizes it with the speed.  »CL6:Graphics
are  ok,  but  the  music  is  not.»CL1: It
sounds so commercial so my ears, and I
would  have  appreciated  a  much more
alternative  soundtrack.  Still,  this
demo  claims  to  be  a party version,
since  you  have to disable some stuff
in  the  CGX setup.  I  hope  a  fixed
version  will  appear.   (With  better
music :)

»CL8:    Cull Bazar/Mawi (Demo, fixed)

»CL1:Code:   »CL7:Kierownik, Kalms
»CL1:Gfx:    »CL7:Azarro, Ubik, Critikill
»CL1:Msx:    »CL7:Distance

»CL1:The Madwizards are the ones  who  want
to   impress    people    not     only
technically, but  also in the artistic
area.  This  makes   Mawi-demos   very
complex  and  demands  a  lot from the
viewer. »CL6:Cull Bazar reveals much of the
potential  these  guys  got.»CL1:   Perfect
colour  combinations, a well-performed
soundtrack,  and  heavy 3D-scenes make
this a beautiful  experience for those
who got  the right  hardware,  »CL6:because
this one  DEMANDS a 604!»CL1:  Although you
are able to turn off the MP3 tune, the
frame-rate    does    not     increase
dramatically.   Still,   the   massive
effects  can  be  defended as very CPU
hungry, and  a  603-200  is  not  that
awesome  when  it comes to the end. To
sum it up,  Cull  Bazar  is one of the
best  PPC  productions that  have been
released this year.

»CL8:     Cruel Karma Kids/Mawi (Demo)

»CL1:Code:  »CL7: Kierownik
»CL1:Gfx:    »CL7:Azarro, Ubik, Fame, Critikill
»CL1:Msx:    »CL7:Substance, Loke, Revisq

»CL1:Mawi  continue  their expressions with
this one. If Cull Bazar took my breath
away, »CL6:this one choked me! By including
three  excellent   MP3   tunes,   dark
coloured  textures, and deep  thoughts
from  Azzaro,  the  demo  attacks  you
without mercy.»CL1: Kierownik  serves you a
huge  number  of  monster effects that
even a PC-coder  must admit are of the
more  heavy  kind.  "Cruel Karma Kids"
goes  on for almost 10 minutes  before
reaching  the  end part,  and I cannot
see any reason why this  should not be
"The  PPC-demo  of  the Year". Any PPC
owner  with  graphic cards and respect
for himself  should  have this demo on
his hard-drive!!!!





»CL8:           212/Mawi (Demo)

»CL1:Code:   »CL7:Kiewronik
»CL1:Gfx:    »CL7:Azarro, Ubik, Prevent
»CL1:Music:  »CL7:Trevor Rabin

»CL1:The latest demo from Mawi is a "rushed
together  in a hurry,  to  win a local
party"  production.  When   the   last
routine  shows up it is also stated in
the   demo  that  it  is  a   preview.
Although  the  routines  are nice, »CL6:the
whole  thing seems  rather chaotic and
does not  work  so  very well with the
rather bad  movie-track.»CL1: As a release,
it is not exactly impressive.




»CL8:      Volta 10000/Mankind (64K)

»CL1:Code:  »CL7: Krabob
»CL1:Msx:    »CL7:Unison

»CL1:A  little,   fast   intro  released at
Spoletium  2001.  »CL6:It  features  a neat
chip tune,  weird textures,  and quite
simple 3D-objects in  a 3D-room.»CL1: It is
nothing special,  but  not bad either.

That was it. 2001  was  the  year with
the  best  PPC-demos  seen on Amiga so
far. I hope there will be more of them
in the future. Most of all I hope more
will  come from the "Western European"
scene, since  I know  there are coders
with PPC out there.
