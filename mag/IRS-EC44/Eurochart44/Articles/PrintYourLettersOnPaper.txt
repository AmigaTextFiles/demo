»CL1:Last week, I received a letter from  a
friend and I must  say that I was very
pleased to read his words (as always).
However,  it  was  far  more enjoyable
this time, because  »CL8:he told me that he
had printed out  the  letter  from me,
since he wanted to  take the  time for
it   and   he  started   to  read»CL1:.  No
computer,     no Amiga,      just him,
the letter,  a coke,  and  his  coach.

This  is  one  of   the  things  which
motivates me to continue swapping  and







write those  letters. I guess  that  I
should get a printer  again  and start
to do the same thing,  because it is a
new way to read the  letters from your
contacts.

»CL6:Way back, when I started  to swap,  it
was common to receive  paper  letters»CL1:,
and there was nothing special in that.
I wrote most of my letters  when I was
in school. It  was  time consuming, so
why not do it when you  were  probably
going to sleep anyway?
The  fact  is  that  listening  to the
radio and reading is  a very different
from to watching movies. You have your
own pictures in your head and you have
to use your imagination if you want to
see things in front of you.

»CL6:The  reason  why  I think that it is a
good  idea  to  print  your letters is
that IRC will not distract you or some
e-mail you need to answer»CL1:. It  is just
you and your letter.

Try to imagine what I  thought  when I
read the  words  from this contact! He
had  done  something  special  with my
letter, so that he could enjoy it even
more. Those  things can soften  an old
swappers heart! At least my heart.  :)

A question. How many  of you sometimes
look at old letters you have stored on
your hard drive or  how  many  of  you
sometimes load Yam to  check  some  of
the older  e-mails  from your friends,
just  to  see  what   they  have  been
writing  to  you  in the past? I guess
that not  many  of you can answer this
question with "I do".

»CL7:I have  collected all  the handwritten
letters  I  received  in   the   past.
Occasionally, I find  them and  browse
through them to remember old  friends»CL1:,
since  most  of  them  are  no  longer
active.

Thank God, fresh blood has been  added
now and  then, so  I  still  have  the
opportunity to send such letters these
days. »CL8:I can only  say  that it is  sad
that  people,  myself   included, have
become  too  lazy  to take the time to
write the letters by hand or at  least
print them out on paper»CL1:.

The  special  contact  we  are talking
about here is Gone. I guess  everybody
know  this  guy. He  is  definitely  a
person  you should contact if you want
to  have  a  reliable  person  around.

That  was  the  closing words for this
article. So, go print your next letter
and   see   if  I   am    not   right.
