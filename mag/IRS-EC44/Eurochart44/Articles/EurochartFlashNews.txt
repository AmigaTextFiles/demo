»CL7:Another issue of  Eurochart  has  been
released and another year  has passed.
Many  might  have  looked  back on the
year that is  no  more  and some might
even have looked  forward and seen the
bright  light?»CL1:   Some  will  face  the
reality and  some  will hide from that
reality. However, you cannot hide from
IRIS and  their  Eurochart, so why try
to, if  you  know  you cannot? »CL8:This is
the  second  attempt  at   making  the
famous  Eurochart  mailing  list»CL1: since
the last  one died along with  all the
articles that  had been written, spell
checked and  colorized in the crash of





my beloved  harddrive. Why lose  faith
and break  down because of that?  Been
there, done that a few times before! I
now know how you get the Lazarus virus
Yeah, yeah, just  laugh -  it  is  not
like you will  be punished for it when
we meet next time.

So, what is  this  all  about? »CL7:I  will
create a mailinglist  with  the people
responsible  for  spreading group news
and  advertisements.»CL1:  Note  that  this
mailing  list  will  only  be used for
Eurochart  matters,  not  personal  or
spreading  matters.   Not   even   the
spreading  of  Eurochart!  This   tool
should  only  be  available  for group
news and  advertisements.  I therefore
hope  that  those  responsible for the
above  mentioned  functions  will help
the Eurochart staff with this idea and
that  you  will send me a mail telling
me  that  you  and  your   group   are
interested.

»CL8:Remember nothing can  be  done without
you and  your help. The  previous list
contained 21 sceners, who supported us
with  group  news  and advertisements.»CL1:

The snailmail address is for any  kind
of  support  and  even normal chitchat
will be welcome.
