»CL1:Having read  "MS PRODUCTION REVIEW" in
EC43 by Darkhawk,  I  have  found some
statements that is currently not TRUE.
I'm  talking  about   the   review  of
»CL6:"The  Squirt" made  by  (as  it' s now
mistakenly considered) 3 Amigos group»CL1:.
First  of   all   I   must   say  that
"The Squirt" is not a 3 Amigos release
entirely. The greater part of the demo
was  made  by Exploder/Push Ent.  Most
importantly 3 Amigos have never stolen
anything from Exploder's works! Why am








I so sure?  Let  me explain everything
now...

I know Exploder personally  as I study
and (consequently) live  in  the  same
city  as  him. He  was  the  first who
showed  me "The Squirt"  parts  before
MekkaSymposium2001.  And  he  told  me
that    this    demo   would   be  his
contribution   to   MS2001,   made  in
cooperation with 3 Amigos. »CL7:So Exploder
has coded all the effects»CL1:. He  is also
the  author  of  the demo sound track.
3 Amigos  made  all  the  between-the-
demo-parts animations. »CL0:The only reason
that the  demo  was released under the
label  of 3 Amigos  was that the rules
of MS2001 require the  author to be at
the  party  personally»CL1:.  Most  of  you
probably  just  don't know  that it is
too god damned expensive to reach
Western  Europe from Russia. Moreover,
Exploder is  not Bill  Gates with his.
lousy  billions  at all! Therefore, he
asked   3    Amigos    to    be    his
representatives  at  the  upcoming MS.
Why the hell  would they  refuse to do
that?  Friendship  is  the  thing that
helps  everyone! So  they  agreed.  To
be  completely  sure  that  the  prize
money would reach the authors, in case
of getting  a  winning position at the
party, Exploder decided to participate
under the 3 Amigos label only. So what
has  become   of    all    this   now?

Yep,  Darkhawk  hits  the point saying
 that Exploder: " has himself used all
his   intro   effects,   changed   the
palettes a bit..." but he's NOT  right
to consider 3 Amigos  to  be  thieves!
They  were  just helping  Exploder  to
participate!

»CL6:Another  incorrect statement  was that
'Exploder has sold his  Amiga and quit
the scene...'»CL1:  From   where  did  such
information come? I  visited  Exploder
recently and  saw his  good-old  A1200
laying on the desk  right  in front of
his  12"  Microvitec  and   two   huge
stereos. The  only  difference is that
now he owns Blizzard 060/66mhz instead
of 030/50mhz. Having talked to him,  I
know that he is not going to leave the
scene  in  the  near  future. He  even
thinks  of  getting  SharkPPC when  it
will  be  possible. I  also  know that
nowadays he  is  engaged  in some  new
projects. So, the  scene  can wait for
something  fresh  from  the  Push Ent.
soon. What will  it  be? Heh, it is  a
secret,   but   only   for   a  while.

And to the last part.  »CL6:Speaking  about
the  quality  of "The  Squirt", I must
admit that Darkhawk is quite right»CL1:. It
is  a  shame  indeed  to  use your old
routines having  retouched them a bit,
though I think that it was  all caused
by the lack of  time before the party.

Believe  new  Push  releases  will  be
something     completely    different.
Frankly,  I  know that  for sure... ;)







         And please remember:
