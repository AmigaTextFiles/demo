»CL1:There  were  12  of us Finns  present,
Dead Meat, 216, Lobotomy, Deeq, Shape,
Kure,  Thg,  Melwyn,   Droid,  Tundra,
Titti, and I (Nosfe).

»CL8:Droid fell into the river.        »CLC:<--

»CL7:Laku smuggled beer to Estonia.    »CLB:<--

»CL1:This   Friday    morning,   21st    of
September, I  woke  up sometime around
9am. My  head  was aching. I had a gig
at "Gloria" last night and had enjoyed







some of the nice cider they offered to
the artists backstage. I decided  that
I was  feeling  too weak to visit work
before going to the ferry terminal, so
instead I just tried to get better and
finished packing for the trip.


I went by Metro to the central railway
station  of Helsinki,  exchanged  some
money at the "Forex" before walking to
the ferry  terminal, just  picking  up
some food on the way.
216 and  Dead  Meat were already there
when  I arrived. We were wondering how
many people were coming  and if we had
enough  ferry tickets. Thursday  night
Droid had told us that Tundra had some
tickets reserved, but that there would
not be one  for Dead Meat, whom had to
buy one himself.

Finally, after an hour or so, everyone
had arrived  and  was  ready  to go to
Phat#1. »CL7:Surprisingly, there was also a
girl,  Titti  from  Oulu, whom  nobody
knew before»CL1:. She had  found  out about
Phat#1 while lurking  on the  altparty
mailing list.

After a bit more  waiting everyone had
his or her tickets  and we went to the
ferry. We soon found some nice leather
couches inside (which  for some reason
were free?!), ssettled in, and started
boozing, naturally.

We also  bought  some  nice stuff from
the tax-free shop on board.

After a while, we  arrived  in  allinn
and  miraculously  we  managed  to get
through   customs   without  too  much
trouble.  (»CL6:Laku    was    taken   into
inspection because he  had way to much
beer, but for some reason they did not
give  him  a  fine, just  a  warning!»CL1:)

 Kure had arranged a taxi  for us,  so
when  Laku  finally  got  out from the
rectal  inspection, we  continued  our
journey to the bus station to buy more
tickets.
»CL8:Shockingly, we  could  not  buy return
tickets  for  everyone  and  therefore
Hannu was left without one.»CL1: Titti also
bought a return  ticket for Monday. At
last,  we  managed  to get on the bus,
just  some  ten   minutes   past   its
original departure,  no  thanks to the
amazingly  SLOW  girl  in  the  ticket
office.

We began  the next part of our journey
enjoying some Jägermeister, Stroh, and
Hirmu   magazines.  Invasion 97  party
report was quite nice stuff to read. I
want to see more Hirmu magazines being
published!

We arrived at the Latvian border where
a Russian-looking female  officer came
to  take  our  passports. "OPEN, OPEN"
she  yelled  to  the   stupid  Finnish
people who  did  not  know how to open
their passports the right way. The bus
driver  was  screaming   at   Hooligan
because he  had  left  his passport in
his bag.

We  got even drunk, and even closer to
Riga.

»CL7:At some point  Hooligan received a SMS
message from Raver telling that he had
been robbed, and  lost  all his money.»CL1:

Some of us got  a bit frightened about
this  incident  and  some  went so far
that they  hid  their  money  in their
socks,   rectal  holes  and wherever..

At  19.50pm  local  time,  we  finally
arrived  at  the  Riga   central   bus
station.   Raver    and   some   other
Lithuanian  guys  were  waiting for us
(can't remember their names.)

We tried to  find  a place to exchange
some  currency,  but  the   place  was
closed  and  instead  we took a bus to
the party place.

When we got off the bus, we  saw a gas
station, which offered some  very nice
items for sale. »CL8:Vodka,  beer, and porn
- what more does a  scener need?»CL1: Well,
some coals for the  barbeque, which we
also bought from the gas station.

However, after walking  another  2-300
meters we finally arrived at the party
place, which was  located on the fifth
floor of an industrial building.

»CL6:The place  was kind of cool. It  was a
couple  of  big   dirty   rooms  in  a
hardcore  condition,  just perfect.»CL1: In
one end of the  main party room, there
were some computers  on  a table and a
quite   large  sound   system.  (Well,
actually  these  arrived  a  bit after
us!)

Of course, we continued boozing.

There were not that many people there,
twelve  of  us  Finns and  then  a few
Latvians. It was okay  though and soon
we were becoming quite happily  drunk.

Eventually,  we  went  out to buy some
food (MEAT!)

We bought some ignition  fluid for the
coals at the  gas station  and went to
the riverbanks finding a nice platform
for us to  booze. So we put some coals
to the ground, some  ignition fluid on
top and voila, we had a fire!

»CL7:We  boozed  and  barbequed  our   meat
(we bought a shitload of meat from the
shop.)»CL1:

A few Latvians had joined us and Droid
and I talked to a spectrum graphician.
People were pissing  in the river  and
having a  good time.  »CL6:Suddenly,  Droid
wanted to piss on the wall, just  next
to the fire. Thg told him not to do it
and   instead "Mee   sinne   jordaniin
kusemaan" (go  into  the  river  for a
piss). Droid  did  as  he was told and
after 3 seconds, we heard this massive
splash when he found out there were no
stairs   he    could    climb    down.»CL1:
Fortunately we managed to get him  out
of  the river, but it  took  some time
for  him  just  to  get  back  to  the
surface and a couple of minutes for us
to lift him up, he's quite heavy.

He was soaking wet.

He took off his shoes and gave all his
money to 216  thinking  that  while he
was so  fucking  drunk  he  could  not
trust himself, and then Jarno was more
reliable concerning these things.

We boozed some more.

Raver also came to booze with us.

We cooked some meat and ate it.

Around 3-4am, most of the other  Finns
left the fire. We were now just Droid,
Raver, a  Latvian  guy, and  I  at the
fire. We boozed some more.

»CL6:When we went inside, we found that all
the  other  Finns   had   passed  out,
lamers»CL1:. A couple of Estonian guys  had
arrived and I tried to tell them about
altparty.  We  kept  on  boozing while
being  inside.  I  passed  out  around
06am,  I  think.  Droid  continued  to
booze for another couple of hours.

On the way  in  from the riverbank, we
went  to  the  gas  station and bought
another bottle of vodka.

"I want  some  vodka",  "Which kind?",
"What  do  you  have?", "One litre  or
half a litre?", "One litre", »CLC: "Do  you
want juice?", "No, I'm from Finland!".»CL1:

Other Finns woke up before  I  did and
they were  going out to eat. They were
noisy  and  woke  me  up, so I  joined
them.

»CL8:The    restaurant    was   quite    an
experience. There  was an  old Latvian
woman who  did  not even know one word
of English»CL1:, so they put  food  on some
plates and we had to point our fingers
to  what   we   wanted.   Mostly   she
delivered what we wanted.

Anyway, the food was cheap.

Some of the Finns then wanted to go to
the city, to exchange  some  money and
buy some food.

Those of us who did not go just stayed
inside continuing the boozing.

I  guess  it  was  a   beautiful   day
outside, but  we  could not care less!
We had vodka!! At  some  point,  Droid
came  up  with  the   idea   that  the
SUOMISKENE   should   make   a   demo.
»CL7:Therefore, we tried to get  the  Amiga
musicians to make some music, but they
failed, since they suck like all Amiga
users.»CL1:

We also started  to  code some shit on
PC and Droid did the gfx.

»CL6:216 finished  coding  the thing during
the night»CL1:. We were supposed to do  the
music live, but given the fact that we
all  passed out  this  never  actually
happened.

I hope that Raver or others showed our
demo there.
It took  about  6  hours for the other
Finns to  get back, at  least  most of
them.  Melwyn,  Dead  Meat,  and  some
others were the  first to show up, and
then came Lobotomy. Titti  was missing
for a few hours but finally managed to
get back.

They had bought a shitload of fish and
stuff so we went out to barbeque.

»CL8:Someone had stolen most of the meat we
bought on Friday  night (»CL7:or maybe some
of us just lost it  during the night»CL8:).»CL1:

I was feeling awful.

We continued the boozing.

We went outside and  started the fire.
It was still daytime  and  some  local
people were fishing on the riverbanks.  
They  looked  somewhat   amazed   when
suddenly   11  very  ugly,  drunk, bad
smelling Finnish people started a fire
on the ground.

The  boozing  continued  and  finally,
Titti came back.

We continued to booze.

It started raining, so we went inside.
We continued boozing.

»CL6:I met a very nice  Latvian girl with a
video  camera  making   some  kind  of
video.»CL1: I am  not  sure  if  the entire
video was about Phat#1  or if she just
needed  some  clips  from  the  place.
Anyway, I was talking to  her when two
Latvian  guys  came  over. One of them
had a big bottle of vodka. He  started
giving shots of vodka, which suited me
just fine.

We continued boozing.

»CL1:Raver managed to get a VCR for showing
my wild-demos, but they  did  not have
time  to  show  them  before  we left.
At least,  I  hope  they  showed  them
after our departure.
There  was  a  music  competition, 1st
song was good, 2nd  was  ok,  3rd  was
boring  and  during  the  4th  song  I
passed out.

»CL7:The demo Suomiskene made can be  found

here:»CLB: http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/
               pirtola/sgene/suomi.zip

»CL1:When I  woke  up, it was time to leave
and go to the bus.

Just as  we  got on the bus, I  puked.
Imagine  six  hours of  happy  journey
with the  smell  of puke in everyone's
noses!!!

We reached the ferry and  went back to
Finland.
Everyone is still alive.

                »CL5:Nosfe

»CL1:"Lobotomy was quite happy drinking  my
vodka-fanta at Phat#1. I  had  to tell
him to stop  several  times before  he
understood. He also bought a bottle of
chilli-vodka for himself!"

»CL8:Sounds like hardcore boozing. Did  you
see any computers there? ;-)

»CL5:                Raver

»CL1:Well,    there were   a  couple.   The
Estonians had some that we  used  them
to  make  the  Suomiskene-demo and  of
course, the local people had some. »CL7:The
coolest machines were a Spectrum in an
old PC-box  and Alice»CL1:, a small red box
with a keyboard  on it and  connectors
for   screen    and    something.  The
prettiest and sexiest computer I  have
ever seen.  It looked fucking cool. If
I remember correctly the  keyboard was
Russian style.

»CL5:                Nosfe

»CL1:I  guess  the  Finns  were the largest
single    nationality.    We    should
celebrate that, I guess.

»CL5:                Setok

»CL1:At least on Friday it was so.



»CL5:                Nosfe

»CL1:While swimming, I had  my  bus  ticket
hidden in the  sock and when giving it
to Jarno, I  only  got  one half of it
out and found  the  rest the following
day. »CL6:The  asshole,  motherfucker  of a
bus driver did not accept it and I had
to pay an extra 200 EEK to get back to
Tallinn»CL1:. I am  very  happy  about  the
fact that  Nosfe  puked  on  the  bus,
unfortunately not into the bus.

»CL5:                Droid

»CL1:When all  is said and done, Phat#1 was
a cool party, even though they did not
have a big screen  and  there were  so
few people.

The right spirit was there and that is
what counts.

»CL5:                Nosfe

»CL1:I hope  someone will add  a  link here
when  they  have  their  photos in the
net. Some of us brought cameras.

»CL8:Today I tried  to  count the number of
visitors and  ended up with 70 so »CL1:far.
This number may  be higher, but I will
investigate a  little  bit and publish
the full list along  with the results.

MEAT! We have now found it and most of
it smells a little bit bad ;)

»CL8:The old woman in the  restaurant said:
"»CLC:But these  Finnish  guys  are  really
strange ones»CL1:".

There were  2 c64s,  3 Amigas  (2 030,
1 060), 1 Alice  (French keyboard!), 3
Spectrums     (1 48K,    2 scorpions),
2 Ataris (1 65xe, 1 2600),  and  about
6 PC's if I recall correctly.

The party  went  on  for  3  days  and
nights  and  people  were  coming  and
going. Friday night and Saturday night
counted  approximately  30-40 visitors
at the same time.

Many of the  things  we  wanted  to do
failed, but  »CL7:it  looks  like  everyone
liked the party, so  our  main goal is
achieved»CL1:! We will start  preparing for
Phat#2 already in order for everything
to be ready in time... though for this
kind of party, a whole week would be a
better choice than  just 3 days - they
pass so quickly.
