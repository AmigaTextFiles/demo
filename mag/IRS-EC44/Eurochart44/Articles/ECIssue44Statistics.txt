»CL1:And, as an added bonus at the  end  of
this mag,  here are some statistics of
the number of  voters per  country, as
well as per group.

»CLA:Poland                              20
»CLB:Denmark                             15
»CLC:Germany                             15
»CL0:Finland                            »CL6: 11
»CL0:Norway                             »CL6: 11
»CL0:England                            »CL6:  7
»CL0:Sweden                             »CL6:  7








»CL0:Netherlands                        »CL6:  6
»CL0:Russia                             »CL6:  4
»CL0:Italy                              »CL6:  3
»CL0:Spain                              »CL6:  2
»CL0:USA                                »CL6:  2
»CL0:Australia                          »CL6:  1
»CL0:Czech. Rep.                        »CL6:  1
»CL0:France                             »CL6:  1
»CL0:Hungary                            »CL6:  1

»CL1:As we can see,  Scandinavia,  Germany,
and   Poland  are  the   main  scenish
countries, at  least according to  who
votes,   but     England     and   The
Netherlands   are   also    quite   ok
represented,  when  thinking about the
non-existing scenes they have in those
countries.  Also,   I   find    it  of
particular   interest   that   we  are
beginning to see a boost of votes from
Russia. Some issues ago, we had  none,
and now.. Is  this a tendency? One can
hope so, if Russia gets  a  blossoming
Amiga scene, it would  really be cool!

»CL8:And now, let us see  which  group  has
the  most  likeable sceners..  I  will
give  beers to  some  members  of  the
winning group on MS as an added bonus,»CL1:
and indeed, next  time, we  will  also
feature  a  prize  to  the  group  who
delivers the most  votes to us, so now
there is some  motivation for you, eh?
Anyway,  the   count  is  as  follows:

»CL1:Weee! I  can  give  myself  some  free
beers!  Congratulations IRIS!  No real
surprise  in the  first placement this
time,  as  I  do virtually everything,
ranging  from  gentle  reminders,   to
threatening  throwing  all  non-voting
members out of IRIS, so it seems  like
this  method  pays  off  in regards to
collecting votes. I  could  just  wish
other groups would deliver more votes,
the best runner  up's deliver 4 votes,
that is also  a little shabby,  seeing
as  the  memberlists  of  many  groups
number 10-15  members. We can also see
that nobody   from e.g.  Loonies  have
even bothered  to vote this time. I do
not  think  it  is  because  they  are
consciously  boycotting  us   at  all,
rather  they  are  just    too   plain
uncaring and  lazy to vote if I am not
giving them a really hard time on IRC.
Oh well, I think  this little piece of
statistic might  be interesting,  so I
will keep it as a recurring feature in
the future.  Maybe  it  will give some
groups a bad conscience, and point out
to other sceners, who  deserve respect
for supporting.
