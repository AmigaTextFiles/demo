»CL1:Time for the credits again, let us not
delay,  but  jump   right    onto  it:

The  code   is  the  traditional  one,
multitasking,  fast   and  functional,
and we have  Quedax of Depth to  thank
for it.

The two intro pictures we feature this
time,  were  done  by  SuperK/IRIS and
Paracels/Placebo. And yes,  they share
a common trend, as you have  seen. But
hey, besides all  the  critics  of the







use of these motives, they are nice to
look at, eh? And we always keep coming
back  to  them.   We   know   what  is
important in this world, mhh?

As for music, we  feature  two  tunes,
'Blunt' by  Dascon of IRIS and 'I Have
a Dream' by Skope/Up Rough.  Those two
share some  similarities too, at least
when you  look in  the  text they have
written, where they both  beg  for  EC
votes.. Heeheh,  is  that  not  sweet?

And  now  for  the   credit   for  the
slave-labour,  that is,  editing. Most
vote and support  begging was done  by
Darkhawk,   votes   were   counted  by
Adonis, Darkhawk, Dr. Doom and Ransom.
Spellchecking  was  done  by  our very
new, very  good spellchecker Hobb, let
us  give  her  a hand! The gallery was
put  together  by Darkhawk and Ransom.
Article colourizing and formatting was
done  by  Adonis,   and    the   final
EC-put-together was  done by Dr. Doom.
Information/picture    gathering   and
updating  was  done  by  Darkhawk  and
Ransom, and news  and adverts have, as
usual, been done by Adonis.

And now for the credits for the actual
articles.  We  have  a  lot  of  guest
writers  this  time,  that is  nice to
see, and we  hope you will be enjoying
their diverse articles.  Look  for the
'Alternative Editor Chart' article for
more in-depth  statistics about  this.
