                      Written by »CL5:Darkus »CL6:of »CL5:IRIS

                »CL5:DARKUS

»CL1:Welcome  to the EC`s private interview
room.  Would  you  like  to  introduce
yourself  to  our  readers? Real name,
age and so on.

                »CL4:OPTIMA

»CL1:Sure. My name is »CL7:Tommy Rasmussen»CL1:,  I'm
28 years  old, I am in my 3rd semester
to be a computer specialist.








                »CL5:DARKUS

»CL1:It`s common  knowledge  that  you  are
currently  a  member of Haujobb. Would
you kindly name us  your former groups
and   briefly   explain   your   scene
history?

                »CL4:OPTIMA

»CL6:I  grew  up  hanging out with Hannibal
of  Lemon    and   Static  Bytes»CL1:.  Our
interest in the scene somewhat started
around '85/'86  or  so.  We  liked the
crack-intros  on the C64 more than the
actual games :) (Oops,  did  I  really
write  the  cra...-word?)   We   liked
programming and started  to experiment
on our own. I never really got hold of
the C64-asm, though.  »CL8:My  first  party
was  the  TSL/RSI in  1990 and  it was
great»CL1:! Since then a  lot has happened.
I have  done  various  crap. I  joined
Focus  Design (don't   remember  when,
actually)  and  later  on   Depth  and
Scoopex. It has been nice.

                »CL5:DARKUS

»CL1:He he, brings  back memories for me, I
used to  watch  the  crack-intros more
than  I   played   the  actual  games.
Looking  through  your  former groups,
it's fair to say you're a  loyal  team
member. Would you say you're happy now
residing  with  the   Haujobb  family?

                »CL4:OPTIMA

»CL1:Yes, definitely. »CL7:The  Jobbers  give me
excellent support»CL1:.  There  is  a  good
atmosphere  and  people love what they
do. Sure, more Amiga-members would  be
nice,  but it's not a problem, really.
I've liked all the  groups I've been a
part of. Friendship is important.  Not
just 'the product'.

                »CL5:DARKUS

»CL1:During  the  past months, Haujobb have
mainly focused on other platforms with
regards  to  our  Amiga  system.  Have
there  been  any   problems  gathering
support from a group, which is heavily
PC motivated?

                »CL4:OPTIMA

»CL1:No, not at all. »CL8:I  use the  PC  a  lot
when I make Amiga-demos»CL1:. I've  written
some  converters  in c++  and  we  use
3dsmax/photoshop etc. heavily. Ok, the
3d-artists  find  it amusing that they
must  limit  themselves  to  1500-2000
polys,  when  they  normally   can  do
around   100.000    poly    meshes  ;)
Haujobbers  like  to  develop for many
platforms,  Therefore,   this   is  no
problem whatsoever.



                »CL5:DARKUS

»CL1:You rocked the scene with the  release
of your Haujobb demo  "Megademo". Were
you pleased with  the reactions of the
unsuspecting Amiga sceners?

                »CL4:OPTIMA

»CL1:Well, I have received  some credit for
it and also some shit, but hey, that's
the way it goes. I  don't  kiss  asses
and I do my own thing  (read  the .txt
in the archive). »CL6:Some of the criticism
was  rather  amusing;  some  Norwegian
girl   claimed   that    Haujobb   had
sabotaged  the  Amiga-compo  at TP»CL1:, so
the EPH-demo  would  suck and we would
win  without  competition!  How  about
that :))
                »CL5:DARKUS

»CL1:Well no big release goes without  some
controversy.  Looking  forwards,  what
can we expect from  you next? Anything
in production as we speak?

                »CL4:OPTIMA

»CL1:I have a little co-op  demo  coming up
(almost ready). I'm not  sure  when it
will   be   released.   TRSAC   is   a
possibility.  I  have  more  ideas and
plans but  nothing ready yet. I'm also
into coding on the PC but I don't know
»CL6:if I'll ever  get  around  to  release
something (for the  scene, that is»CL1: :))



                »CL5:DARKUS

»CL1:Can you be more specific regarding the
co-op demo? We want details!

                »CL4:OPTIMA

»CL1:Hmm, you are twisting my arm! :) Well,
»CL8:I have  my  main  man IB/Depth on  the
graphics.  He  is  one  of   the  most
talented artists  I  know»CL1:  and it's  a
great pleasure to work with him again.
That's  all  you'll   get   for   now!

                »CL5:DARKUS

»CL1:Hehe,  ok,  I  won't   nag  any  more!
Changing direction  a little,  who  do
you rate  highly  amongst  the  active
Amiga coders today? Do you  see anyone
as a cut above the rest?

                »CL4:OPTIMA

»CL1:Well, guys like  Kalms  and  Blueberry
know  their  code;) However,  I'm  sad
to  say  that  it doesn't mean they're
producing interesting demos. »CL6:I  really
wouldn't know  who  to vote for in the
coders  chart»CL1:,  sorry.   However,  TBL
(as a group) have done some  excellent
demos with  "Rain"  and  "The  Perfect
Circle".

                »CL5:DARKUS

»CL1:I expected  such  an answer.  I myself
find it  hard  to decide who reigns in
the scene  today.  Returning  to  your
Megademo, various people explained  to
me that  they didn't have  the  needed
hardware  requirements  to   run  your
production. Do you  intend  to use the
best hardware available? Whilst  maybe
forgetting  that  the  average  scener
doesn't have the capabilities to watch
it?

                »CL4:OPTIMA

»CL1:Hmm, it  was  a  bit   heavy   on  the
ram-consumption but  should be able to
run with 020? Well,  »CL8:I have  4060/2+32
ram  and  I  only  concentrate on this
configuration»CL1:. I like good resolutions
and  many colours -  that  takes  060.
Maybe I am a lazy, less skilled coder,
but so be it ;)


                »CL5:DARKUS

»CL1:Sounds very unprofessional to me,  but
it's getting late here in England  and
my  bed  is  tempting me.   Feel  free
to  write   any   messages,  fuckings,
greets or anything you want.

                »CL4:OPTIMA

»CL1:Well, I just want to  greet my friends
- especially Corial. I look forward to
seeing you  all again  and  have a few
beers with you :)  Please  write  some
new and interesting code -  don't hide
it in all  that  pointless  design and
collage shit.  »CLD:Oneframe  is  not worth
anything  in   itself»CL1:.   Sleep   tight
- where ever you are ;)

                »CL5:DARKUS

»CL1:Thanks  for your time Tommy;  we at EC
look     forward   to    your   future
productions!

                »CL4:OPTIMA

»CL1:    Thank you, it was a pleasure.
