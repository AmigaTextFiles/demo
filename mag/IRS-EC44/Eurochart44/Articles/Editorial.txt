»CL1:Where do  we  go from here? This  is a
typical,  nonsensical  question  which
editors like  to ask.  Obviously there
are many answers; forwards, backwards,
















up, down,  in, out,  etc. These may be
combined in many ways (»CL7:although moving
in two opposite directions at the same
time seems difficult, try it sometime»CL1:)
Those trying to  go backwards  may  be
pushed forward by  the masses, or vice
versa. »CL8:Those  trying  to move sideways
may trip  and  smash vital organs, and
whatever goes  up must come down»CL1: (just
as what goes in must come out). At any
rate, the  important  thing   is  that
everyone and  everything  seems  to be
going somewhere.

The only direction we have to avoid is
away. Among  the  few  things that are
standing still is the  Amiga. »CL7:This may
be  regrettable, but  it  really  only
means it's up to  us to pick it up and
carry on  the legacy»CL1:, or otherwise any
direction leads away from the thing we
hold most precious.


With   these    officially    profound
thoughts,  »CL6:I  officially  declare this
issue   of   The   Official  Eurochart
officially     released»CL1:,   and,   more
importantly,  I  declare  The Official
Coders   Corner  officially   released
along with it.

This  week (hah!)  we'll look at, hold
your  breath...  various  topics! What
this means, really,  is that we're too
close  to  The  Official   Deadline to
start including  interesting articles,
so,  if  at all possible, please enjoy
what we have to offer.

Thank you.
