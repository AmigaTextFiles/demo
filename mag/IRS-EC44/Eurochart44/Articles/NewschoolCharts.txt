»CL1:I  just  finished  reading  Darkhawk's
article about charts in  the  last  EC
issue and since he asked for feedback,
here are my  views  about that matter.

»CL8:Well, some people complain  about  old
sceners/productions   still   in   the
charts etc.»CL1: I just ask myself, what is
wrong about that. For me, charts serve
the  purpose  of  giving  an  overview
about good productions, no  matter how
old they might be! Therefore, the idea
to have separate  charts for oldschool







and newschool  productions   is  utter
nonsense in my opinion! I have been in
the scene  for  more than a decade now
and  I  have  seen  quite  many  demos
during  my  scene life,  both old- and
newschool.    Personally,   »CL7: I    like
oldschool  productions  much more than
most of the newer  stuff but that does
not  mean  that  I  vote for oldschool
productions  only.»CL1:   If  I   think   a
newschool  production deserves a place
in the charts, then I vote for it so I
do  not  see  any  reason to split the
charts. »CL8:For  me  it  seems, that those
people who  want   to   have  separate
charts are  simply  envious  that they
cannot beat productions that were made
by people  who  have  quit  the  scene
years ago. »CL1: However,  is  that  really
unfair?   No,  because  even   if  the
producers  of  a  demo  may  not  even
possess an Amiga  anymore,  their work
remains  even  in  the year 2001! I do
not  care  if   for   example   Laxity
of Ex-Kefrens  does   not  remember  a
single  MC68k  opcode  nowadays.  What
counts for me is that he made gorgeous
productions during his active time and
therefore  I  simply  vote  for Desert
Dream as best demo, because I liked it
in 1993 when it was released and still
do so today. (Hey, Kefrens dedicated a
demo to me ("The Wall" by  Kefrens was
dedicated to  the Berlin people, guess
where  I  live) so I  am  supposed  to
praise them :P) . What  is the problem
with that? A  production  should be in
the charts because  it is good and NOT
because   it    belongs      to    the
old/newschool  area!  In  addition, if
you  cannot  beat  an  oldschool demo,
well, try harder  next time, then  you
might  make  it  into   the    charts!
»CL7:Moreover,  nobody  forces you to  vote
for old-school  productions  if you do
not want to  do that, so  why  are you
complaining? »CL1: Just  because  people do
not like (or know...)  oldschool demos
does  not  mean  that they  should  be
banned from  the charts.  Either  REAL
charts  (i.e.  charts   covering   all
productions  (from the very  beginning
of the demo scene  until today) or  no
charts at all!
