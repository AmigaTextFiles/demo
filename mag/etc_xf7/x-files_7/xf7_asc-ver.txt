Amiga Convention '96
--------------------
The Official Info Pack on the Amiga Convention '96

In August, in Montreal, the fourth annual Amiga Convention
will take place!  This convention will gather the Amiga
community together from all across the world to show its
support for the Amiga!  We hope to make this show an event
in the long fight to make the Amiga a well known computer
in North America again.


WHY: We are putting on the Amiga Convention '96 (AC 96) to
     support our favorite computer, the Amiga!  We feel
     that for too long, the Amiga has been ignored, and now
     that the Amiga is owned by people who actually will
     support it well, we want to help them out in any way
     we can.
     We also want to get a lot of people together to have
     a really cool time!


WHERE: The Howard Johnson Hotel in Montreal, large enough
       to hold over 1,000 people, not including the
       surrounding rooms.



ADDRESS:  Howard Johnson
          (514)-842-3961
          475 Sherbrooke West Street
          Montreal (Quebec)
          Canada
          H3A 2L9

TIME   : 10:00 - 20:00 (8:00 PM) Saturday

COST FOR RENTING TABLES : $150 - 1 day,  $250 - 2 days,
                          for one table of 6' by 3' and
                          chairs.
                          These tables are aimed towards
                          dealers and developers.


FREE TABLES:  We will also have free tables at AC'96, for
              anyone who wishes to BRING THEIR AMIGA,
              whether to show off something cool, or just
              to help someone else who might need one at
              the time.
              However, at the free tables you get less
              space than the pay tables, it is first-come
              first-serve, and you cannot sell products at
              the tables!
              That is strictly for the rented tables.


ACCESABILITY:  The show is easily accesable by bus and
               subway, as well as having lots of parking
               space in the vicinity for cars.


WHY DEALERS SHOULD COME:  At AC'96, we offer tables at an
                          incredibly rate, a price which
                          includes electrical outlets and
                          electricity. You also get the
                          chance to show and sell your
                          wares to a crowd of Amiga owners,
                          all of whom have money to spend
                          and are influenced by how big a
                          prescence you have at the show.

WHY PEOPLE SHOULD COME:   AC'96 will have stands from many
                          major dealers and developers. It
                          will also have a lot of friendly
                          Amiga owners there, plus a
                          booming sound system and TV setup
                          that will show crazy demos and
                          products. It will be a wild good
                          time for all!
                          BRING YOUR AMIGA AND HAVE A BALL

Why In Koeping??
-----------------------------------------------------------

Koeping is a small town in the middle of Sweden. With car it
only takes 30 minutes from Vsters and oerebro, and less
than two hours from Stockholm. Koeping is also connected to
one large European road so there is no problem finding the
way to the party.

Go By Car
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you travel from Stockholm; The north way: follow E18
through Vsters to Koeping. The south way; follow E20
through Strngns, and Eskilstuna. Turn towards Kungsoer,
and then towards Koeping. From oerebro; Go towards Arboga,
and from there take E18 towards Koeping Once you're in
Koeping follow the signs saying Hospital (You know the
symbol: A red cross). The Hospital lies on a street called
"Glasgatan". And when you're at the Hospital just cross the
street and you're there. We will also put out signs, so
there'll be no problem finding the party (but if you still
can't find the place; ask some nice guy or girl where the
hospital is, or where KMV is :-).

Go by train
-----------------------------------------------------------

Well I must admit that I never travel by train so I can't
describe how to get to Koeping by one of those, but there's
no problem because when you buy the ticket they will tell
you where to change train and other important (?) things.
When you've got of the train at Koepings station just cross
the street and walk along "Glasgatan" tha party place is on
the left side of the street. We will put out signs where
the entrance is. The best thing is, there's only about 100
meters from the station to the party place.

Go by Bus
-----------------------------------------------------------

All busses stops right at the party place, so when you're
getting on the bus just take a chat with the busdriver, and
ask him to tell you when you're there. Remember to ask for
"glasgatan". we have signs so you can't miss the place, but
if you miss it, just ask someone where glasgatan is....

Partyrules
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. The partyplace is a non-smoking area, so if you want to
   take any of these cancer-sticks, it'll have to be
   outside the building (Sorry..)
2. You're allowed drinking alcohol at the party (Yeeehaaa!)
   but if you don't want to be thrown out, take it easy
   with the booozzze!
3. We don't want to see anyone just trying to destroy for
   everyone. So if you consider yourself a troublemaker:
   Stay at home !!
4. All thieves of all kinds will be handed over to the
   local police. And you must admit: How fun is it losing
   a SEK 15,000 computer?
5. Copyright material is of course not allowed to copy, and
   each and everyone are responsible of their own actions.

- To make sure these rules are followed, we have a whole
  bunch of trained guards making all they can to make the
  party work all right.

Fun Fun Fun
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you're fed up with sitting in front of your computer,
just join in with all our funny "Games" such as; Throwing
Discs, Harddrives etc. Or why not our Computer Jeopardy
Competition. You can also watch the latest cinema releases
on a big screen. If you have any suggestions or maybe you
want to arrange something really outrageous, just tell
us, the party MUST be FUN!

Entrance Fee
-----------------------------------------------------------

The entrance fee is SEK 180 at location and SEK 150 if you
pay in advance. If you pay in advance we must have the
money the 30th of June. We want this to be a yearly
tradition with this party, So you can't miss this First
One. To pay in advance you use one of these Postgiroforms,
and write your name, address, and handle, and go to your
local postoffice. Use Postgiroaccount no: 493 26 43-2

pay for it.
We take no responsibility for illegal swapping, or sale of
software, hardware, video etc.
We have made an agreement with the danish anti-priacy
organization that they will not bust the party, but instead
host a conference on software piracy.

our web site and at The Summer Party 1996, both on the net
and a few hours after the last deadline on CD which will
