Before  anything, I wish  you a Happy New Year. I hope that 1997 will
be a very good year for you, with tons of new CD's and good news from
your preferred bands.

This  year, we're waiting for new material from  Machine  Head,  Fear
Factory, Iron Maiden, Metallica ( with the following  of  Load )  and
many more. We will, of course, tell you the  latest news when they'll
be out.

So, Point & Rock begins to  get some  response. Continue in this way.
It seems that most of you are pleased  to read this mag. Many of you,
dear readers, told me to  continue  in  this way. I will ! But I need
more and more support...

In this issue, we will talk a little bit of Guns n' Roses. Things get
special in this band : Slash is out ! We have investigated on the net
to find out more. You will read the results further in this issue.

I was speaking of a  surprise last  edition. I had planned to provide
you a live record of Pearl Jam in Germany, but things went wrong ( my
brother scratched the tape ) so I have nothing to give ya. I have old
records of Metallica and  Aerosmith  at Woodstock II on tapes. If you
are interested, contact me.

We are also Internet connected. So, if you have access to this media,
you can  contact  me at Thunus.Raphael@ping.be to receive a vote form

The  Vote  Form design has been  a little  bit  improved due  to  the
talented ASCII  dude aC!d  from Doggystyle. Thanx to him... Well done
mate !

Well, I'm leaving here, have a nice reading and Happy New Year...

@Node Kiss "Kiss in Brussels"

@{b}"The great Circus is in the Town, please welcome KISS"@{ub}

Well, this month's concert  report is about KISS. I never listened to
a Kiss' album  but a  friend  gave  me the two Alive to hear what was
meant to be played.

So, this Sunday on the 1st of December, we did the travel to Brussels
to see the mighty Kiss. Arrived  in the  neighboor of the capital, we
saw a giant light in the sky and we said while kidding that it was to
announce that the circus  was in  town. That was true ! The light was
coming from Forest National, the concert place !

Just the time to  find a place to park the car ( and it was hard 'coz
the show was sold out ), we  enter in the arena and find a good place
to see.

The  support  band ( I don't  remember the name ) was a classic post-
Pearl Jam/Alice in  Chains  group. So I  must say that it was nothing
special.

After it, we  had  to  wait  some 45 minutes to finally see Kiss. The
music played in the  place  was  a mix a Filter, Pantera, and quite a
lot of @{"Metallica" Link MetInfo}.

Finally, the light went off, the scene  was  covered by a giant black
Kiss flag, showing the KISS letters with the lights on the  scene. We
heard the traditional "You  want  the  best, you  got the best... The
hottest band in the world : KISS ". The flag was pulled out and... Oh
Shocking !!! It was the  best  scene I  ever saw in a concert. Lights
were very bright, a mega Kiss logo shining behind the drums... 

During 2 hours long, the classic songs of the band were played in all
their glory. Everything was very nice : a lot of special effects like
the guitar of Ace Frehley  launching  rockets,  the  bassist  who  is
flying in the air, fireworks and so on.

For more details, I let you  read the @{"Donington Festival 1996" Link Donington} report.

One thing is sure, it's one of  the  best  shows  I've ever seen. The
band is in a great form and their come back is a huge success.

@endnode

@node Donington "The Donington festival 1996"

First  of  all, I  would  like to salute all  the readers of this new
multimedia  magazine, I  will  sporadically  appear on these lines to
help  the  chief  redactor  while  talking  about  anything  I  judge
interesting ( I hope ). You  guess  it's  my  definition of a muddler
journalist...

@{b}+-------------------------------+

|                               |
+-------------------------------+@{ub}

This year ( Note of Redactor : Last  Year... ), the organisators have
another time assured the reputation of  the festival with the help of
big bands of the Metal World, but the best of the event was undoubtly
the KISS' Come Back ! And what a Come Back !!!

All the day  long of  this 17th of august 1996, under a scorching sun
( ± 30°C !!! ), somewhere in the english Midlands, we felt this magic
gliding above the circuit' site : maked-up fans or totally dressed up
like their heroes, bearded 40 year old men walking around with a beer
and  their  fat  women, multi-cultural atmosphere  with  english men,
scandinavian, germans, italians, frenchies, belgians ( East Belgium :
11 persons ! ), spanishes and even  americans having already seen the
KISS since the debut  of the  new tour, everything mixing in joy with
little  assholes ( 13-14  years old ) with  T-Shirts  of DOG EAT DOG,
with  excited  fans  of  SEPULTURA and  @{"BIOHAZARD" Link BioInfo}, with  white flour
natives...

Finally,  the  music  ! ( Let  the  music  do   the  talking ! ). The
festival, previously called " The Monsters of Rock " was composed for
the first  time  of two  stages ( Note of Redactor : I think it's the
second time, guy... ). The small  stage  was situated in front of the
big one, on the left side, near the entrance.

Seen the importance of the program  on the  big stage, the little one
has been a  little  forgotten by the  public, but everything that was
happening on this scene was seen on  the two  giant screens  near the
big scene. 

On the little stage called " KERRANG STAGE ", we could see :
- CECIL : unknown and no attention from myself
- HONEYCRACK : same thing
- 3 COLOURS RED : same thing
- EVERCLEAR : first interesting  thing, it  looks  like  Greenday but
              with better melodies and not so honeyed
- TYPE O NEGATIVE : the  great  PETE  made  them  all  wet !  Reduced
                    program but efficient, quite disappointing in the
                    light of the day
- @{"KORN" link KornInfo} : unintersting rap/metal ( for me ) because too  typical  and
         foreseeable. More, I have not  paid  attention  because  the
         great moment was approaching.

The  big  stage  looked  like  a  great  mushroom. In front of 50.000
persons, @{"FEAR FACTORY" Link FearInfo} began the  hostilities. Even  if their techno-
thrash has not yet  touched me  at all, their  made people move under
the 12.00 am sun.
The Burton C Bell's band  left the  stage after 40 minutes, leaving a
hot crowd...

Came the time  of PARADISE LOST, very expected because they're at the
top of their  glory but unfortunately it seems they were not at their
best place. Under  a  really hot  sun and  without  any  light  show,
PARADISE LOST failed to catch the  attention  of the crowd except for
unconditionnal fans ( as me ). The set was  essentially  composed  of
the  last  album " Draconian Times " ( The  Lost  Time,  Once  Solem,
Forever Failure, Hallowed Land,... ) but  also some  hits of " Icon "
( Embes  Fire, True Belief,... ) and some  classics ( As I Die ). The
english band has however  been  applauded  for their  courage and the
simple fact to be there.

DOG EAT DOG or,  smells  like  Biactol ! Up and down movements, their
rap/metal crossover was quite  out of place in this context. First, I
am not interested  by this  band, but  their kind-little-boy attitude
seeming  to  ask : Have  you  seen my  new fluo cap ??? is boring me.
Well, it seemed to please the youngest of us, thus everyone with :
- an upside down cap on da head
- a short until the knees,
- a DOG EAT DOG T-shirt !!!

Let's speak  about  @{"BIOHAZARD" Link BioInfo}, who  seems  get  more and more "rap",
forgetting a little their metal roots. Crushed  by the  sun, lying on
the ground, all I remember is " Fuck the rules, fuck, fuck the rules,
yo, fuck the rules... " of  the " Mata Leao "  album  and  Punishment
from " Urban  Discipline ". Evan  Steinfel, the  tattooed  and shaved
bassist told  again  the  old  story  of  the  band  when, at another
Donington festival, they have hurt the security  service because this
one has beaten some fans, forcing the  band to  say  that  they won't
come back here, and blah blah blah to excite a little more the crowd,
but they  have decided to come back  however because  KISS was there
( and also the money... )

SEPULTURA was very expected, to believe the T-shirts... As far as I'm
concerned, I  have  stayed  outside  the  crowd ( I wanted to keep my
forces for the rest ).
The crowd has been  surprised by  the  annoucement of the organisator
himself : Max Cavalera won't be there  because he had to come back at
home with his wife because  her  son ( 1st marriage ) has been killed
in an accident.
SEPULTURA has  expected  a  lot  on their presence at the festival so
they decided  to  assure a performance  to  content  everyone ( and I
think themselves ). We have seen then a "light" version  of SEPULTURA
with Andreas Kisser at the only guitar and on vocals !!!
The usual set-list  has  been ±  kept, the  songs from " Roots " have
been well accepted due to  the draft character  of these songs. After
an " Overkill " ( MOTÖRHEAD ) directly  from  hell, the   bresillians
have been applauded and left the stage after 1 hour of concert.

The temperature began  to  fall  but  the crowd began to get more and
more excited because the  Madman was  about to come... At the place I
was, the front stage  looked  like  a  huge  dust  cloud. If you were
closer, it was  a  battle  with  container  filled with sand... Those
english men have strange traditions !

" I love you all, Donington let's get fuckin' crazy ! ". @{"Ozzy" Link OzzyInfo} himself
appears  and  Paranoid  explodes. Donington  get  really  crazy ! The
Madman presents his  new group : Joe Holmes ( yet since the beginning
of the tour ), Robert Trujillo ( ex-Suicidal Tendencies ) and Michael
Bordin ( from Faith No More ). Donington  lets himself drown into the
madness of the well-named Madman. Ozzy drops some water containers on
him and waters the crowd with  his water  cart. He runs on stage from
left to right as a pinguin wearing  Pampers ( you must have see it to
understand ).
Unfortunately, his 47 years betray  him  after 5 songs, Ozzy began to
have some serious voice problems especially in high notes and he  had
go backstage to get some healing. But he will  assure the rest of the
show with the honours.
The show is the same as the tour : songs from  the 3 last albums with
classics of the 2 firsts and hits of Black Sabbath.
" Do what you fuckin' want " said  Ozzy  to  the crowd. They answered
with a big " fuckin' yeah !!! ".
After more than 80 minutes of  madness, the  show is over, the Madman
leaves the stage, applauded and even ovationned by a raging public.

The night begins to fall but the  public  gets more and more nervous.
To show their impatience, some excited  throw a lot of projectiles in
the air : plastic containers, mud, condoms filled with sand... It's a
miracle that I don't have been touched by those missiles !

The waiting is long, but when it's  totally dark, the great moment is
VERY near...
The KISS' helicopter  which  has  flied  above  the site all day long
appears just above the top of the stage. Everybody  thinks  then that
the band is coming by the roof, but at  this  moment, the 4 musicians
come  out of the  ground  of  the  scene  filled with a huge cloud of
smoke.

It's a total  explosion, a  complete  climax : DEUCE is launched, the
pyrotechnic  effects  projected to  the sky, the KISS logo is lighted
and beats with the rythm, the lightshow  flashes  in  all directions,
the giant screen behind the drums follows all the movements.

For myself, I'm feeling transported 20  years back in time, just like
in a fantastic movie, happy  as  a  child, tears  in  my  eyes, as  a
child !!! I should have weared large pants ( remember the 70's ? ).

KING OF THE NIGHTIME World follows, a complete row of Marshall  high-
speakers appears. Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons are walking along the
stage, Ace Frehley is  quite  static and Peter  Criss is crushing his
drums... The public is exstatic in front of such a debauchery. It's a
long time we have ever seen this kind of show in musical world.

DO YOU LOVE ME, WATCHIN' YOU  and 100.000 YEARS with his fire columns
follow. During CALLING DR LOVE, Gene Simmons shows his bat-wings with
an imposing look. During FIREHOUSE, the bassist  spits fire while the
revolving light is on and smoke comes on stage.

Follows then  STRUTTER, the  public  sing along with the band, LET ME
GO, ROCK 'N ROLL raise a little more the atmosphere.

During  SHOCK  ME, Ace  sings  and  plays a quite disappointing solo, 
makes  his guitar smoke, launches rockets in the sky with his guitar.
Finally, the intrument goes in the air with a cable.

People who  never saw  the  show must  not believe their eyes and ask
themselves   some  questions. So  it  wasn't  lies, it's  TRUE,  it's
REALITY !

LOVE GUN ( find  the  meaning  of  this  classic title ) and COLD GIN
follow. During COLD GIN, Paul asks to the crowd his preferred drink :
gin, southern confort  or  orange juice, the  answer  is very clear :
what a band of alcoholics !

The light falls down, appears Gene Simmons in a majestic  pose in the
middle of a cloud of green smoke, watching the public with a menacing
look. We  see  then a  blood trail  coming  from his mouth. The crowd
howls, some think that the bassist must  have  a real stomach problem
while playing a rythm on his bass. He spits a long  flow  of blood on
his costume. It's GOD OF THUNDER's time, the more  diabolical  moment
of the evening. The bassist is  suddenly  projected in the sky and he
goes to a platform at the top of the stage. He watches  now Donington
with terrible eyes.

After the demon gets back on the ground, Peter Criss  plays  a  drums
solo quite boring.

The band ends his regular show with SHOUT IT OUT LOUD where the crowd
participates furiously while  singing with  the group. The atmosphere
is crazy.

After  a  little  pause  where  the members of the band appear on the
giant screens, Paul Stanley came back  alone  with  his guitar Ibanez
" Iceman " and played  a  well made  intro  of BLACK DIAMOND. A great
mirror ball gets down from the roof and reflects  light-rays in every
directions.
The other musicians came and continued the song  with  Peter Criss on
vocals as in the good old times. At the end  of  the  song  and  in a
thunder  of  explosions,  the  drums  began  to raise to the roof and
showed  a  decoration with two  tigers  appeared at the bottom of the 
drums. A wall of flames raised to the sky on  the  both  sides of the
drums, the crowd howled yet.... 

BANG ! Is it over ? No it ain't !

The band gets on stage  again  and plays, for  me, one  of their best 
songs : DETROIT ROCK CITY, the song  begins with a thunder  of pyros,
the legendary solo tears the  night and the public is on the knees...

BANG ! Is it over ? No it ain't !

The band gets on stage for a last time and begins with  a drum roll :
ROCK AND ROLL ALL NITE ( And party  everyday... ), Hymn  amongst  the
hymns, it's the total exstasy. The  public is in  heaven. All special
effects are launched for the  last  time and Paul  Stanley destroys a
guitar.
The band thanks the public to have  participated to this exceptionnal
event  and  promises  to come back. At  the end of the song, a mighty
firework took place, just  like  if all  the  special effects weren't
enough. The public had no chance  to call  back  the band for another
time.

That's it ! It was the KISS' première on  the european continent, and
it was a total success !!!

I'm finishing the concert with  irish  guys, eyes  filled with tears,
arms in arms, watching the unfinishing firework. I think  I've seen a
lot of concerts but this one was one of the BEST I've seen, thanks to
KISS for this unforgettable day !!! Some fans even thought  that KISS
is better than SEX

See you next time, dear readers...

To end up this article, I would like to  thank  the following persons
to have passed 3 marvelous days :
- The rest of the "band" : Achim, Dany, Georges, Marc, Jonny, Daniel,
                           Stéphane, Marcel, Sabine and Michaël.
- The woman with the cheese burgers !
- The indian man with his long limonade !

@Node Article "Slash leaves Guns N' Roses"

@{"Slash" Link sys:Images/slash.gif/MAIN}

It seems that it's definitely a fact : Slash is actually  out of Guns
N' Roses. We have decided to investigate through  the net to discover
more  informations  about  that  major  news  for the end of 1996. We
suggest  you  to go  on to  the next  web  pages  to read it. We have
managed to summarize the different infos found there.

http://www.students.uiuc.edu/~t-gray/axl.html
http://www.metaverse.com/vibe/sleaze
http://casemix.queensu.ca/marina/garden.html

Here follows a text transcripted from MTV news dated 1 November 1996.
 
" Guitarist  SLASH  has finally  walked out on GUNS N' ROSES after 11 
years. The split  was  apparently by "mutual agreement" with frontman
AXL ROSE. Ironically, last week Slash  admitted  he didn't know if he
had a future in the heavy rock  group. He said, "It's  really hard to
say where that's going to go. I don't even know if I'm going to be in
the band or not. Right now I'm just  going  through  a trial  period.
A lot has gone on between me and Axl. He and  I have  only had dinner
twice where we've  managed to get to  the point where we were civil."
Gun N' Roses, who haven't released an album  for four years, will now
be looking for a replacement  for Slash. But they  insist  they won't
be inviting former axe man  IZZY STRADLIN  back into the fold. Slash,
meanwhile, will carry on working with  the  SLASH'S SNAKEPIT group he
formed two years ago while Guns 'N' Roses took a lengthy hiatus. "



THE Fax ( sent to MTV )

LIVE!!!!  From "Burning Hills", California...

Due  to  overwhelming  enthusiasm, and  that "DIVE  IN  AND  FIND THE
MONKEY" attitude.... 

#1. There will NOT be a Guns N' Roses tour.
#2. There will NOT be an official Guns N' Roses web site.
#3. There will NOT be any NEW Guns N' Roses videos.
#4. There will NOT be any new Guns N' Roses involved merhandise.
#5. There will NOT be a Guns N' Roses Fan Club.
#6. There will be a new Guns N' Roses 12 songs minimum recording with
    three original "B" sides.
    NOTE:  If all goes well this will be immediately repeated.
#7. However*******Slash will not be involved in any new Guns N' Roses 
    endeavors, as  far  has  not been musically involved with Guns N'
    Roses since April 1994 with the exception of  a BRIEF feel period
    with Zakk Wylde and a 2  week initial  period with  Guns N' Roses
    in the  late fall  of '95.  He (Slash)  has  been "OFFICIALLY and
    LEGALLY"  outside of the Guns N' Roses Partnership since December
    31, 1995.


		Nothing here is Subject To Change
		Without A PERMANENT SUSPENSION
		Of the "Pseudo Studio Musician Work Ethic"
				SINCERELY,
				W. AXL ROSE (signed)
				W. Axl Rose

2 hypothesis are now available : Slash left  GNR  alone or  Slash has
been kicked away by the two other original members of  the band : Axl
and Duff. We can't say wich one is the truth.

We sure understand the position of Slash : he has been  bored  to see
his ideas continually rejected by Axl ( we've read that  the material
of "It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere" was  destined  to  the new album of the
gunners ). That's why he build up the Snakepit, waiting Axl to  be in
better mood. But Axl has been bored to see Slash out  of Guns... This
applies too to Duff and Matt : Axl threaten them to be kicked away if
they don't stop working  with Neurotic  Outsiders. Axl the Tyrant !!!

From  here, why don't think about an Axl Only Guns n' Roses  band ???
He said that he owns the rights of the name so he  can  edit an album
with every musician he wants...

We're now waiting for more informations  about  that subject. We will
tell you them when we'll get it. One thing is sure, Axl wants to edit
a new album for GNR. Let's hope it will be so  good than Appetite for
Destruction ( I've some doubts... )

@Node use "How to use it?"

Very  easy : you just have to point your mouse on each item you  want
to  read. The program will go to the part of the  mag  that interests
you. 
For the @{"vote form" Link Vote}, select print in the project menu and connect your
printer !!!

I have built  the mag while thinking that each time an information is
available  about a  band ( news, concert or anything else ), the name
would be highlighted. So each  time you  see a  button containing the
name of the band, a simple click will  give  you everything available
about it !

It has been a pleasure to  be  with  you  once again. I would like to
encourage you to continue to support me. I begin  to get some answers
and it's very nice. The Load's Lyrics seem to pleased some of you, so
I'll do it again with other bands. 

On  the  other  side, someone  told  me  that  P&R was  a  little bit
commercial sometimes. He was speaking  about  the charts, complaining
about seeing  Bon  Jovi  and  Garbage in it... I must tell that I use
the charts of 2 Hard  Rock  magazines  to  build mine ( and also with
YOURS ). The two bands named above were classed in  those mags, so it
was  reflected in mine... If you want  to  see  a  more "underground"
chart, then vote ! The 25 best albums will be in the mag.

I also hope that the improvements done with the graphics pleased you.
Tell me what do you think about the photos. I know  there were only 2
pictures in this mag but I hope to give you  more  next time. All you
need is working datatypes for jpeg and gif ( the  2  usual formats of
pics on the net ).

If you have interesting  links  to  web pages, E-mail me the address.
I'm planning to edit a list of Web pages for  every band we can find.
Help me in this adventure !

So, it's really the end now, I will  see  you  in  two months for the
next edition : number 4 of Point & Rock !

--- I want Rock and Roll all nite, and party every day --- Kiss


                                Yours, 
                                Mister No ^ aßS

@Node Albums "Albums to listen"

@{b}@{"Anathema" Link AnaInfo} : Eternity@{ub}

This month I will talk you about the new album  of Anathema. First of
all, I  could  tell  you  to  not  listen  this album if you are in a
depressive state of mind : you  could  easily  pull  a bullet in your
head !!!

However, this album is fantastic. The first audition is disappointing
because you must listen it 2 or 3 times again to discover what it has
to give. 

After a splendid intro where  the  guitars  are  sadly accompanying a
piano, you will enter in  a world full of  atmospheres  created  with
keyboards. Everything is very dark and sad. The bass  lines are good.
It's an excellent piece of doom work !

One single song escape from this lot : it's a  reprise  of  a song of
David Gilmour and Roy Harper.

So, my final quote for this piece of musical  depression is 9/10. You
know what you have to do if you like doom ( if it's  not already done
of course ).
