             »CL4:by Curt Cool

»CL0:The next issue of your favourite
chartmag which of course is »CL1:'The
Official Eurochart'» is, as the
matematical genius'es among you
might be able to deduce, issue #33,
which will be released at the
»CL1:Symposium Mekka 1998» near Hamburg,
Germany.

As that party will be held from the
10th to the 13th of April, the
»CL9:deadline» for #33 is on the »CL1:26th of
March».

You can deliver things to us until and
on the party of course, but the later
it gets, the lesser chance we will use
it. But, always remember:

»CLA:       * VOTES ALWAYS WANTED *»

»CL1:But why such a break of about 3
months between each issue?»

This is a question many people have
asked, and there actually is a reason:

We believe that most major demos are
released at major parties these days,
and as there are only about 4-5 major
parties per year, there is no actual
basis for change in the charts
inbetween the parties - and thereby,
not much reason to release the
Eurochart more often than we already
do.

»CL1:But then why do we usually release the
Eurochart at parties?»

Because it gives me & Cytron a chance
of true cooperation, and the voters a
chance of seeing the demos of the
party before (strangely enough the
major parties are also held with a
pause of about 3 months between each).

So now you know, and we don't have to
answer those questions anymore - or...
what?
