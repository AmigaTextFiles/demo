»CL0:Yes, it's »CL1:SHOWTIME!» The Official
Eurochart is back again to once again
bring you what you deserve -
comprehensive charts, quality & 
up-to-date articles and a funny
gallery to boot, lightly showing you
the way into the year of 1998 where we
will once again see new talents emerge
from nowhere, old ones return and
others leave - who can predict, who
knows, the Amiga might experience the
revelation we are all hoping so much
for, and then again it might not - who
knows, legendary groups may return,
legendary sceners may reappear and
make a difference - and some will, and
some will go - and YOU will be there
to experience it, that is, if you
survive the new years eve.

»BIG:I»SML:n this issue of the »CL1:Eurochart», we
have once again chosen a different
path to fame - or just being well
known - yes, we are talking about the
design which is probably one of the
most acidic designs in a diskmag - and
we love it! But hopefully it will give
reason for debate on the scene (and
look in the credits to see who made
it...»PIC:Acid1.iff»










And of course, the code is still
multitasking, the chartstats are still
the most comprehensive ever, and the
music is as good as ever - but perhaps
there is a small Achilles' heal, thorn
in the eye, call it what you like: 
We need more »CL1:QUALITY», »CL1:UP2DATE» articles
for the Euronews section, so if you
consider yourself able to write 
articles in the same quality as those
featured here, contact us now!

Anyway, go on - read on - listen to
the music - watch - experience - enjoy
