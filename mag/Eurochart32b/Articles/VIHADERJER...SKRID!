»CL0:Sitting here in my toga in the middle
of it all; in the middle of a
»CL1:30-40-50-hour streak» of coding,
chartmaking, drinking, partying,
dancing, all the things you usually do
when you are awake, I come to think of
- actually I ask myself: What has
really changed my mood during this
party? What has made my sweet
partymemories go down the drain?
The answer - sad but true (»CL3:DA DA DA
DAAAA DA DA DA»)... The girls.
I'm sick of tired of all these girls
coming to parties. They totally ruin
my good time.
I mean - I'm used to wandering around
in whatever I find suitable, not
caring as much as one little bit,
which close, I'm wearing, how fat I am
and greasy my hair is. But no no - all
of a sudden we will find these parties
turned into pure semesters of sex and
girls. Orgies of pure manianism will
soon be the worst fear of every
amigascener.
Dear amigafellows.
»CL9:How long do we have to put up with
this?»
On the behalf of every amigascener
with the least of common sense left I
hereby demand an »CL9:INSTANT» embargo of
all female visitors at parties. They
have got no right to come here and
ruin the last fun that the PCs haven't
already taken from us.
In here, we can peek our noses, smell
like shit, look strange, code demos,
smoke joints, and in general be some
decent swines. So let us have just
these 20 days a year where we can be
left out of your insane world full of
perfume, flowers, love, sickening
stuff in general and tits. Thank you.
