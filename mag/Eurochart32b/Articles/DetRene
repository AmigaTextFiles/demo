             »CL4:by Curt Cool

»CL0:It is the truth. We have heard from
»CL1:Trix/Anarchy», the Danish Anarchy
organizer, organizer of the first The
Parties, old Danish scene celebrity,
that »CL4:Anarchy is reborn». Who cannot
remember the legendary works of »CL1:Dan»,
»CL1:Facet», »CL1:Nuke», »CL1:Hannibal», »CL1:Mad Freak»,
»CL1:4-Mat» - just to mention a few.
Who cannot remember '»CL1:Legalize It 1 & 
2»', '»CL1:In the Kitchen»', '»CL1:Flower Power»',
etc. etc. etc. After all, who gave
name to 'The Anarchy Award', the scene
Oscar back in the early 90's?

We have heard that an issue of their
legendary diskmag »CL1:'Stolen Data'» will
be released soon as well, telling the
scene that Anarchy really IS back.
Many members should have rejoined the
scene - so you can really expect
code, graphics, music and editorship 
of top quality from »CL1:Stolen Data».

But it's not over here, because in
fact Anarchy has been alive all the
time. 
In fact, »CL1:Tron», the famous coder from
»CL1:Artwork», and before that, Sanity has
confided that 'in fact Artwork was
never really Artwork, it just started
as a joke division of Anarchy, and
all Artwork releases are in fact
just a fake - they're really Anarchy
releases'.

But of course we at the »CL1:Eurochart»
staff always try to investigate
things a bit deeper - »CL1:Tron» could be
pulling our leg there - so we decided
to ask »CL1:Artworks» main organizer,
Damion if this scenic sensation
really could have just a tiny fragment
of truth in it - but before we
managed to ask him, we saw the little
note on his shirt saying 'Damion/
really Anarchy, not Artwork as you all
thought - gotcha there!' (in fact the
note was not all that little).

But having found one sensation, they
thought we would be pleased and
hungry no more - but they were wrong,
the scenic investigators decided to
push their long nose much further
into these very scenerious matters.

So we asked »CL1:Facet/TBL», also an ex.
Anarchy member, and he told us about
the same thing - and once again, when
talking to some other TBL members -
they confided to us that in fact
Facet had long ago convinced them
into joining Anarchy.

This was beginning to look like a
serious conspiracy to us - could it
be that in fact the whole scene was
Anarchy, and that we were the only
group left not to be members of
Anarchy - or even worse, that we in
fact are members of Anarchy without
even knowing it - if somebody can
decline this, please tell us,
otherwise don't.
