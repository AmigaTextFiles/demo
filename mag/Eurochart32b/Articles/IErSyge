            20-22 February
»CL9:--------------------------------------

»CL0:Take heed!! This is not the 100%
finished version of this text, but it
may seem like it ;) We haven't got the
address of the school yet, but as the
deadlines draw near, we have to
release this. Therefore, check out our
homepage and the intro we'll release
in January, it will feature the
address and an updated partytxt!

»CL1:WHY
---
»Why not? This is the third time we
hold Scene Meeting, the meeting for
the Amiga Scene. We've held it one
official time and one unofficial time.
We've arranged it together with
Ambrosia in the past, but they're
sadly either inavailable or too PC
minded now ;) So this year, we hold it
on our own, with help from the Amiga
club Amiga-Djurs, who have been so
kind as to find a partyplace for us,
which is way out in the country, with
cows grazing outside probably.. Or
maybe not ;)

Why hold Scene Meeting? Well, it's fun
to do, and we always earn enough money
with the event not to need doing
anything else the rest of the year..
Yes, that's true, we actually take all
the money you bring with you, and keep
it for ourselves, as entrancefee..
That's true, yep.. Ehmm, if you'd want
to know what the entrancefee will be
this year, check out the INFO&RULES
section now. Otherwise, continue to
read this gibberish.

It's not the BIG secret, that mainly
danes will show up, as it is in
Denmark we hold this (although one
could argue how much of Denmark is up
there, where the party is to take
place, hehe), so prepare to speak a
bit of Danish ;) Ofcourse all
information and compo' thingies will
be done with an English speaking
person, for your convenience, if you
have the money for it.. Ehh, no that
was not quite right..

And, you can be sure, that there'll
ONLY be Amiga owners at SM98'! We do
not accept PC owners at all! Or
rather, we won't accept any PC inside
of the partyplace. If we see one, this
year we'll use it for our PC-THROWING
compo's, so now you've been warned!
(and we mean it! Stay away PC's!) The
intent of this party is to be like the
parties of old. A lot of sceners, with
the right computer and the right
spirit doing funny things together
(why do you think it's called SM,
eh?), competing and talking and
ravaging the town outside of the
partyplace. BUT NOT THE PARTYPLACE! ;)
We don't expect the big amount of
sceners, infact, be so nice as to not
attend more than 150 +- 40 persons, or
you'll have to sit on the lawn
outside, or maybe in a classroom, if
you PAY for it (aren't we the
commercial ones? Hehe)...

»CL1:WHEN&WHERE
----------»
Yes, the party takes place in Denmark,
20-22 February 1998.. Fine.. Now
attend..

Huh? An address? Arhh, don't be
primitve, can't you even find it on
your own? I said we didn't have more
space than for 150 or so people, so we
decided to limit the number of people
attending, by not giving any address.
You'll have to find it for yoursef..
That's right.. Bye...

Ok ok ok.. The actual address is:
???????

You can begin showing up at around 10
o'clock in the morning, if you feel
like it. Ofcourse most of us, the
hardworking organizers will sleep at
that time, because we've been boozing
the day before, but atleast there'll
be electricity (boy, aren't you
beginning to feel welcome, huh'?)..
And the party will end again at 18.00
sunday. Aprox... You'll not PRECISELY
be thrown out at that time, but we'll
cut the electricity and begin packing
down the tables, turn of the light,
let in the rottweilers and well. You'd
better get going home around there...
Just for your own safety ofcourse.
Oki, now the address has been given
out, might aswell give out some car,
train, bus and ferry times too..
»CL1:HOW TO REACH SM BY CAR:»

Yes, if you come from Europa, but not
Scandinavia, then you have to drive
NORTH! Yep, that's right, north!
Follow the motorway up till' you are
about to reach the second biggest city
in DK, with the name of "Århus". Then
you'll have to drive EAST! Yep, east.
Ehhm, follow the signs to "Grenå", and
when you're in Grenå, there's only 5
km to the partyplace.. Oki, now you
can find it yourself? No? Ok ok ok ..
Longer explanation follows in the
intro...





»CL1:HOW TO REACH SM BY FERRY:»

Yep, boats (the ones that sail and
stuff) go to "Grenå" from erhm, what's
it called in English.. "Sjællands
Odde", so if you come from "Sjælland",
that's the easiest and the least
expensive route to take.

If you come from Sweden or Norway, you
can take the ferry to XX and XX, and
then drive SOUTH to "Århus" and then
EAST to "Grenå", etc..


»CL1:HOW TO REACH SM BY TRAIN:»
Well, tell them you'll want to reach
"Grenå" in Denmark, via "Århus", and
if they don't get that, they must be
stupid.. Easy enough, eh?

»CL1:THE BUSSES FROM/TO GRENÅ:»
(Yet to come... Sorry guys! -ed)

»CL1:INFO&RULES
----------»
As you probably have surmised, this
text isn't too serious. Yep, that's
right it isn't, because this really is
a small, cozy, noncommercial party,
without network, internet or PC
Quakers. You'll have to get your own
fun, there'll be no non stop action
from us, there'll be no concerts, no
food to be bought at the partyplace,
no nothing, no facilities at all.. No
wait, that was not ENTIRELY correct..
You know, the partyplace is 5km
distant from the somewhat big town of
Grenå, where there's McDonalds (a
partyplace without McD, wouldn't be a
partyplace, now would it?), lotsa'
other things, and lotsa BEER! And
drugs too for that matter, hehe ;)
You're not completely stuck in Ålsø,
the boring partytown, with a
convenience store, and 2 inhabitants +
this school, so don't despair.. This
were the outside facilities.. Isn't
that cool?

Inside? Hmm, we have a hall at a
school, we have ELECTRICITY, we have
tables, we have SOME toilets I think
(don't you just LOOOVE thorough
planning? Heh), we have a little
chips/drink/etc. shop with NORMAL
prizes for you and then we have.. Uhmm
yes well. It's noncommercial! You'll
have to have fun without all the
crappy TP facilities hehe. But check           »PIC:Z1.iff»
the rules section later, for how you
may NOT have fun INSIDE atleast ;) And
now (tadaaaa).. The entrancefees! (and
if you think that there'll be no
compoprizes because of the
entrancefees, check the compo section,
hehe..):

Entrancefee for male danes:      0Dkr, 000000000!!
Entrancefee for male foreigners: 0Dkr, 000000000!!
Entrancefee for all females:     0Dkr  (and I'll give you a beer at a pub, ok?)

Yes, hope you can manage this
exceedingly high fee. As I already
have stated, we're TOTALLY
noncommercial, and this MUST prove it,
no? Next time we'll probably PAY you
to attend.. Or maybe not... ;) No
sponsors either, we've gotten




















everything for free, thanks to
contacts and the Danish welfaresystem,
hehe.. And YES, there'll be good audio
equipment and a biiiigscreen atleast
20x20 meters! Oki, maybe not, but
atleast it won't be a television or
something equally small ;)

We'll be showing demos and stuff on
the bigscreen now and then, when we
feel like it, and there's nothing else
going on. If you hate the scene and
demos, DON'T ATTEND!! :) And, if you
feel like you have something special
to show, a video, a production,
anything, then don't be afraid to ask
us about showing it:)

And, as an exclusive service to make
sure you'll not be disappointed or
bored at this party: IF YOU'RE BORED,
YOU WILL GET YOUR ENTRANCE FEE
REFUNDED!!! Shiit, aren't we the
benevolent organizers?

And as for sleepingspace.. Well, this
is a school, and there's probably only
one hall used for patying, so there'll
be a smaller hall for sleeping. Happy
now?

Here are some addresses of the
mainorganizer (that's me, ofcourse,
heeh), if you want more info (what
more could you possibly want to know,
after you've read this invitation
text? Hehe), if you want to reserve
tables (300 Dkr per reservation..
Ehmm, not, I guess..), or if you
want.. Well, something.. Please drop
me a note (or drop me a chat, eh),
just saying that YOU will be there, so
that we can take apropriate action if
I get over 1000 of those notes, hehe..

how good your entry is, heeeheeeeheh..


»CL1:THE RULES:»

Yes yes, sad and boring and
capitalistic, I know, but there ARE
rules.. Ehmm, I don't have time for
them now though, have to attend a
lesson on the Uni.. See you later
(ehh?).. DAMN! First time I'm up for
that lesson in two months, and then
it's CANCELLED! Is THAT the thanks for
me loyally sticking to this study?
Ehmm, I know, I digress terribly.. The
rules then..

1. You may NOT, NAADA, IKKE, NICHT,
   ETC. bring ANY COMPUTER having
   affilation to the PC. That includes
   laptops. We have warned you! We
   DON'T want to look at ANY PC!

2. Hmm, a boring rule: You may not
   damage anything at the school.. If
   you do, pay for it or die!

3. Drugs&Alcohol are....

4. Smoking (normal tobacco that is,
   heh) is...

5. If you puke ANYWHERE in the school,
   two organizers will use YOU to
   clean up the mess (if you
   understand...)

That's it.. That isn't too bad, is it?
Please follow those simple rules,
crack, copy, fuck, etc., as you like,
but follow those rules! (pretty
please?).. That includes you too -->
DEPTH <-- !!! ;)

And, remember:
 THIS PARTY IS FOR THE AMIGA SCENE!

(but other Amiga owners are welcome too)


COMPETITIONS
------------

For all competitions we will use an
Amiga 4060, 50mhz and ENOUGH fastram,
to show the various things, but the
things MUST be able to run at the
specified minimumconfiguration stated
in the various compo's coming up. Else
you can't compete.. And you have to be
at the party to get the prizes. If you
aren't, but you win, you'll still have
the honour of winning, but the money
will be passed down amongst those
actually present..

AMIGA DEMO
----------

Must not exceed 5mb of packed size.
Must run from progdir: without
assigns. Will be shown to the end,
scrollers/plotters not included.  Must
work on an Amiga 1200 with a 50mhz
030'er and 8mb of FastRAM.

Responsible for Amiga Demo: Darkhawk

AMIGA INTRO
-----------

Will be held with 2 or more intros,
but then there WON'T be prizes for all
3 entries, heh. They must be able to
run on an Amiga 1200 with a 50mhz
030'er and 4 mb of FastRAM. The size
limit  is 40k, NOT 64k.. Make a demo
instead, if you have a 64k intro ready
;)

Responsible for Amiga Intro: Darkhawk

4 CHANNEL MUSIC COMPETITON
--------------------------

This is your standard, run of the mill
Protracker module compo. Modules up to
880k unpacked are allowed, the tune
will be played for 5 minutes, if too
many entries are delivered, a  quite
competent jury will be selected to
bring down the number  of competing
modules to 15. Ofcourse only one
module for each musician.

Responsible for the 4 Channel Music
Competition: Notman

MULTI CHANNEL COMPETITION
-------------------------

If enough modules are delivered (3 or
4), we'll have this compo too. Your
modules can be made in whatever AMIGA
musicprogram you want, that uses more
than 4 channels. Otherwise, it's the
same rules as the 4 channel compo..
Only the first ranked will get any
prize though. The others will have to
be satisfied with the extreme honour
of it ;)

Responsible for the Multi Channel
Music Competition: Notman

GRAPHICS COMPETITION
--------------------

Only iff pictures accepted, NO
raytracings (see the raytracing  compo
later), clearly digitized/scanned
pictures will be disqualified, drawn
copies are ok though. Only one picture
per graphician.

Responsible for the Graphics
Competition: Ransom

BEST RAYTRACING
---------------

All formats will be displayed if
possible. There'll only be one "real"
prize that is, but we might give the
secondplace a liter of milk or
something too! ;)

Responsible for the Best Raytracing
Competition: Ransom

SURPRISE COMPO'S
----------------

These will be held if we'll manage to
come up with something out of the
ordinary, but apart from that, we're
open for suggestions, game
tournaments, etc..

Responsible for Surprise Compo's:
Various


PRIZES
------

Yes yes, now your eyes are gleaming
with greed, eh, and all the big groups
start calculating if they all can get
their trip refunded, if they win the
democompetition. Well, as you have
seen now, the entrance is for free, so
where do we get money? Quite easy,
we're using all the money we won with
our demo Kilkenny at an earlier party,
so we have a prizebudget of 4500 Dkr,
aprox, not counting some games we won
too, and unforeseen expenses. I can
tell you the percents of the money,
that each compo will receive, ->IF<-
there's enough entries. If there isn't
enough entries, we'll use some of the
money in other competetions, but if
you e.g had a demo finished, and
release it at SM anyway, you'll get
SOME recompense, never fear!

Amiga Demo:     50%
Amiga Intro:    25%
Amiga 4Channel: 12%
Amiga Graphics: 12%

(HARHARRR!! We'll keep one percent of
our own money for ourselves, maybe..
BOY are we capitalistic!)

Raytracing, Multichannel and Surprise
compo's will get from another pool of
ressources, that we have ready. You
won't be disappointed though (or
you'll get your entrancefee back!
Hahah)...

And yes, I think that even if we
manage to win some more competitions
before the next SM, the next SM will
feature entrancefees. This is just a
commercial trick to get you to attend
NOW, and next year, we'll have an
entrancefee of 400 Dkr per person per
day! (Then again.. Maybe not..)

That's it, that's all! Now attend damn
you!
