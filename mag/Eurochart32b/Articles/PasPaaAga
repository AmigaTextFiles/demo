»CL0:Let's talk about the »CL1:AMIGA» computer
for a while. The past so to speak. The
ECS generation. With only 1/2 MB there  »PIC:Zack4.iff»
wasn't much memory to play with.
Obviously people 'invented' tricks to
bypass this problem. For example the
trackloader. Later on memory
expansions came at hand, and people
started to produce ONE-file demos.
Easy to store on a harddisk. It took
some years untill the ECS concept was
used to it's limits. The routines used
in demos weren't that much different
from eachother, though exceptions
ignored of course. A boring
developement, yet Commodore was at the
rescue and introduced the »CL1:AGA Amiga»
species to the scene. The new era
started in 1993. The ECS era ended
right at this moment, but the scene
needed some time to exchange their old
machine for the new one. 
                      At »CL1:The Party
                      1993», the by now
                      legendary group
                      »CL1:Sanity» was the
                      first real loser
                      of the new AGA
                      age. Sanity's
                      demo »CL1:ARTE» was
                      according to the
                      ECS standards
                      one of the best
                      demos ever, but
could obviously not compete with the
new AGA computers. Sanity got a 3rd
place with ARTE leaving »CL1:Complex» and
»CL1:Virtual Dreams» above them. As everybody
knows AGA gave the scene a chance to
start over again. ECS and AGA are
totally different and couldn't be
compared with eachother. So, why did I
write this small history text? I wrote
it as an example for a danger that
infiltrated today's Amiga scene.  
»CL4:Party's are trying to set new
standards to use the »CL5:060 processor» at
demo competitions. Wouldn't it be
awfull to see a new 020/030 TBL demo
loosing from a group who is using 060
technology? Just because their
routines run so smooth. While the
overall rating of the demo is actually
worse than the TBL demo. Wouldn't it
be awful when we hear the response of
the coder(s) of the winning demo
»CL5:"Well, we just put the demo together
in a week, 060 really helps alot"» when
TBL worked 2 months on there demo and
get's a second place? Then it's not
the best demo that wins, but the demo
which uses the best (read: fastest)
technology. What a bummer!
»CL0:It's in total about 5 years ago since
we started to push the AGA chipset to
it's limits. And now at the end of
1997 we are back to where we started.
We have trown ECS into the trashcan,
now it's time to do this with AGA as
well. The scene needs a new AMIGA
computer, a new chipset to start the
same kind of revolution like in 1993.
Help us Commodore, you're our only
hope..
