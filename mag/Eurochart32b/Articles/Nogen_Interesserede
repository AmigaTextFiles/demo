»CL0:As I've been working my socks off
during the last five weeks, I simply
haven't been able to give away the
time it took to make another part of
the »CL1:Coder's Course.»

be time for a little fast article,

single response to the article, I
guess that none of our dear readers
actually take any interest in this
course. Therefore - unless I hear
otherwise before »CL1:SymMekka'98» - this
might »CL9:conclude» the »CL1:Coder's Corner»....
