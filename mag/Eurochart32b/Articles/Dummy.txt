»CL4:      As credited by Curt Cool.

»CL0:As usual, the code was made by »CL1:Quedax»,
and a few improvements were made 
since last time, just to make it
easier for the hardworking editors to
compile the Eurochart!

The main editor was, as it has been 
since issue 28, »CL1:Cytron», this time
responsible for the article
formatting, the gallery, counting of
homepage votes, votetool, some
articles and the main code on the
Eurochart intro - yes, our man »CL1:Cytron»
has certainly been busy once again -
along with studying hard, drinking
hard, and trying hard to meet girls
via the internet, coding more effects
etc. etc. etc.

As co-main-editor (a new word recently
invented by me -Curt.) we have myself,
the one and only »CL1:Curt Cool», who am 
responsible for the main votecounting,
quite a few articles, editing the
news (as »CL1:Bakerman» is in the army),
making some more photographs for the
stats as well as keeping the stats as
up2date as possible - and he too has
been busy with going to school to gain
some points to get into university,
making music for The Party 7
productions, boozing like a lunatic
and generally enjoying himself.


»CL4:Us aside, we say thanks to »CL5:Kalf/
Darkage», »CL5:Magic/Nah-Kolor», »CL5:SiDo/Depth»
(who just got out of jail, nice to
have you back mate! :) and »CL5:Tricktrax/
Puzzle» for some articles, thanks a 
bunch dudes.

The great retro design was made/drawn
by Depth's very own TVstar graphician,
»CL5:Ib», amazingly original, retro 8o's and
in my humble opinion, incredibly cool
design.

The titlepicture was drawn by our good
friend »CL5:Dr. Zulu/Giga Productions»,
thank you for helping us out in a
tight spot, Thomas!



»CL0:The music was composed by »CL1:Racoon/
C-Lous & Darkage» (1st module), »CL1:Marc/
Haujobb» (2nd module) and »CL1:Michael "One
2 One"/Anathema» (3rd module).

The clip-art was drawn by »CL1:Zack/
Spaceballs», »CL1:Judas/Capsule», »CL1:Acid/
Nah-Kolor», »CL1:Dr. Zulu/Giga Productions»,
»CL1:Zone/Nerve» Axis and »CL1:Fly/Depth».

The intro was coded by »CL1:Cytron/Depth»
and »CL1:Blueberry/Efreet», featuring
»CL1:Scout/C-Lous» (the zoomer, THANKS), 
with graphics by »CL1:hund.» and »CL1:Ib/Depth»
and music by »CL1:Cytron», featuring »CL1:Curt
Cool» as the remixer.
