»CL0:Well, why is »CL1:'The Official Eurochart'»
called »CL1:'The Official Eurochart'»? And
why is »CL1:'Showtime'» the official scene 
chart?
And what does the word »CL1:'Official'»
actually mean in these names and
slogans?

Well, first we will have to define
what official means out there in the
big, dangerous, pulsating world.
The easiest thing is to find out what
the uppersit, which necessarily has to
be unofficial, means. Unofficial news.
for example, is something quite close
to simple gossip, and something which
is not (yet) to be admitted by the
parts involved in it.
An unofficial copy is about the same
as a pirate copy of some kind.

So basically, official means
something which is officially endorsed
by someone, something which is true,
something which the persons involved
in making it believe in and are
willing to take the responsibility
for.

So can there be more than one official
chart? Personally, I certainly think
so - but it seems that certain people
is a bit miffed with the fact that the
word that the above paragraphs has 
been about makes up about 43% of »CL1:'The
Official Eurochart'» name - and
frankly, we'd remove the »CL1:'Official'»
part if it wasn't for the fact that
»CL1:'The Official Eurochart'» has been »CL1:'The
Official Eurochart'» for more than »CL9:30
issues» now - and changing the name
after so long would just seem so lame,
and make the legendary »CL1:Crusaders» who
we have so much to thank for, look
ridiculous. 
The word itself seem pretty childish
and pretentious to me in a scene which
is for fun - but perhaps times are
changing and we are all going to be
commercial demo companies with a boss
who can fire people etc. in the
future? I hope not.
