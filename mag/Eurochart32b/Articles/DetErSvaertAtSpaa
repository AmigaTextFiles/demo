             »CL5:by Curt Cool


     »CL0:»BIG:1997»SML:   »CL1:-» What happened?
     »CL4:»BIG:1998»SML: »CL5:-» What can we expect?

»CL0:By now we are seated at »CL1:The Party 7»,
The Party which as all the earlier 
The Parties concludes the year it is 
held. By the end of this party, there
are 2 days left of 1997, and therefore
it is time to wonder what 1997 brought
us, as well as to think about what
1998 will bring the ever demolishing
scene. Well, I ask myself, what »CL1:DID»
1997 bring us?
The star group in 1996 was »CL1:The Black
Lotus», but in '97, they only released
the very mediocre »CL1:'Panacea'», and
the fantastic »CL1:'Captured Dreams'», which
took 1st place at The Gathering in
front of Artwork's »CL1:'Exit Planet Dust'»
and Limited Edition's »CL1:'Deus Ex
Machina'». And perhaps that was the
highlight of 1997. But that was
in the month of march, and should one
not think that a group like The Black
Lotus who released several huge demos
during 1996 could do better than that?
By now it seems like The Black Lotus
has vanished to where the legends rest
- or what? As far as the word goes,
»CL1:Offa & Equalizer» are heavily involved
in games development on other
platforms these days, so I guess we
shouldn't expect much more from these
guys, and the TBL pc division is
taking members from the Amiga one,
so...
But still, TBL are at the top of the
charts, and their only challengers for
their position are the mostly German
»CL1:Artwork», who haven't released any
demos since »CL1:The Gathering/SympoMekka»
either.
But of course, 1997 has brought
several other changes to our beloved
scene: »CL1:Limited Edition» have really
kicked off with 'Deus Ex Machina',
(which I think is better than both
Captured Dreams AND Exit Planet Dust)
'Ritual' and 'Henriques Chocolate',
»CL1:Rebels» returned with 'Paradroid',
»CL1:Scoopex» climbed up with 'The Sign &
Zero Gravity 3', two unknown groups
made demos which made it to the 1st
place at their respective parties,
»CL1:Nerve Axis» won the Assembly with
'Pulse' and brought forth a new coder
star, the 27-year old Tommy Schlott 
and »CL1:Powerline» won Icing with 
'Repugnance'. Another group of 
1997 is »CL1:Mellow Chips», who by mid-year
joined »CL1:TRSI» as subdivision. Their
demo 'Dose' is already very popular,
and so is their coder, Aivo, who is
the coder behind Dose. 
And when mentioning Mellow Chips, let
us not forget that other Finnish 
groups like »CL1:Embassy», »CL1:Artificial 
People», the seemingly resurrected
»CL1:DCS», the Finnish members of »CL1:Haujobb»,
and »CL1:Zenon» have also provided us with
quality  productions from what was 
once THE scene country, and perhaps
still is.
»CL4:Another group, who have made it big in
1997 are »CL5:Darkage», who has released 
several intros and a demo all coded 
by Modem, who has also made it into
the charts - and of course it also
helps, that Darkage has taken over
»CL5:Showtime» from Ram Jam, and is
releasing a bit more often than the
chartmag your careful eyes are
presently going over.
Another group of this kind is »CL5:Mystic»,
who created a stir when Jamie, Norm, 
Marvin & Horus joined them from 
Essence, only to end up reforming 
their old group »CL5:Skarla». But Mystic has
other members, Geezer & JamSam in
Sweden, SHD in Finland, Rendall in
Hungary etc., so I guess we're still
in for some treats from these guys!

»CL0:In Sweden, (apart from Rebels,
Powerline & The Black Lotus), »CL1:C-Lous»
and »CL1:Subspace» have been making quality
demos, and »CL1:3 Little Elks» are still
supplying us with funny productions -
thought the days of 'Passengers' and
'The Tribe' seem to have gone with the
present inactivity of Tabasco &
Explorer - but the scene loves 3LE for
their humour anyway! Other Swedish
groups worth mentioning are »CL1:Tulou»,
»CL1:Smoke», »CL1:Ward» and »CL1:Logic Probe» who have 
also made several demos during 1997 -
all the mentioned groups making the
Swedish scene the most important of
1997.
     »PIC:Z1.iff»



»CL4:Another scene which has been bubbling
with activity is the Norwegian one,
seemingly having survived the great
»CL9:FunCom disaster» in 94-95, and though
the only really well-known group with
true basis in Norway these days is
»CL5:Spaceballs», who very much seems
to be BACK, but groups like »CL5:Instinct»,
»CL5:EMS Design», »CL5:Contraz», »CL5:Ephidrena»,
»CL5:Triumph» and »CL5:Donut Fetish» (where the
»CL5:ex. Stone Arts» coder, Niggerjack is a
member) are also worth mentioning.
»CL0:In Denmark, things are pretty quiet -
»CL1:Depth» are, as you may know, releasing
the Eurochart, and, as The Party 7
will show, quite a lot of other
things, »CL1:Puzzle» came 2nd at The
Assembly with 'Zoo' and »CL1:IRIS» won The
Copenhagen Party with 'Kilkenny'. 
Then you have to mention »CL1:Ambrosia»,
who is very much in trouble at the 
moment, and »CL1:Focus Design», which
is dead, of which the two remaining 
members, Kollaps is now in »CL1:Instinct»,
and Optima is now in, yes, Depth!
Apart from these groups, the remaining
active groups on the Danish scene are
groups like »CL1:Fnuque» (of which many
members are also members of Depth),
»CL1:Loonies» and »CL1:Efreet», who took our
breath away with the 4k intro 'Peanut'
at The Party 6 - they might have 
the most talented coders on the scene
today.
And »CL1:Impact DK» died on the Amiga, »CL9:RIP».
»CL4:In Germany, apart from »CL5:Artwork», we saw
a demo from the group »CL5:Arsenic» at
SympoMekka, which featured fantastic
code, a demo from »CL5:Oxyron» at the same
place, but the really famous groups in
Germany are still »CL5:Essence», »CL5:Haujobb» and
»CL5:Abyss», who still very much seem to be
able to provide us with new and cool
demos. Other German groups worth
mentioning are »CL5:Matrix», »CL5:TRSI», »CL5:Bizarre
Arts» & »CL5:Nuance».
   »PIC:Judas1.iff»













»CL0:In Holland, »CL1:Infant» coded some
productions for a lot of various
groups, but the most important
surprise is probably the reforming of
»CL1:Lemon.», and before that, of »CL1:Desire»,
both with Infant as the coder.
»CL4:In Hungary, the great »CL5:Impulse» provided
us with the great Kenguru II, then the
members decided to shut down the group
but then some of them return under the
label of »CL5:'Kangooroo'». Apart from 
Kangooroo, the other Hungarian group 
manifesting itself in '97 was 
»CL5:Frame 18».
»CL0:In Spain, the most important groups of
1997 has been »CL1:Capsule», who has
provided us with plenty a few good 
intros and »CL1:Network», who have also made
some demos and besides made the diskmag
Trashcan.

»CL0:In France, we have the group »CL1:'Ramses'»  »PIC:Keiju1.iff»
who won the Spanish Euskal Party,
»CL1:Silicon», »CL1:Bomb» and »CL1:Gods», as well as a
powerful division of »CL1:Scoopex», which
must be described as the main group of
France at the moment, after »CL1:Syndrome's»
lack of activity in '97. Or? By now
Skarla has returned, and I guess that
we all know by now that they can
provide us with some productions of
genuine quality - the fantastic 'Thug
Life' says it all. But apart from
these groups, the French scene seems
to be gone - or what, perhaps there
should have been a lot of demos
released at Saturne 5? One can only
hope.






                          »CL4:Anyhow, in
                          other
                          countries,
                          we have 
                          »CL5:Elven 11»
                          (Italy),
                          »CL5:Corrosion»
                          (Yugoslavia)
                          and »CL5:Looker
                          House»
                          (Russia).







»CL0:And among the truely multinational
groups, we can count »CL1:Scoopex», »CL1:Mystic»,
»CL1:IRIS», »CL1:The Black Lotus», »CL1:Depth», »CL1:Abyss»,
»CL1:Nah-Kolor», »CL1:DCS», »CL1:Haujobb», »CL1:The Black
Lotus» & »CL1:TRSI», who have all been pretty
active during 1997 - the internet is
the thing which keeps people together,
and as many, many sceners have access
to internet these days, these 
seemingly huge groups are actually 
possible to organize without really
loosing anybody in the process
- so they'll live on, unlike eg.
the legendary »CL1:Anarchy» which died
because of the lack of contact between
divisions.



»CL8:    But what will happen in 1998?
--------------------------------------»

(The famous clairvoyant Curt Cool sees
into the future, and gives his
predictions..... :-) )



»CL7:The Norwegian scene» will continue it's
resurrection - »CL1:Spaceballs» is a good
front cover, and you should expect
cool things from them, but they won't
be the biggest - young ambitious
groups like »CL1:Donut Fetish», »CL1:Ephidrena»
and »CL1:Instinct» will rule
The Gathering '98.



We will see at least one or two groups
rise from their ashes, I predict that
these two will be »CL1:Polka Bros» (because
that »CL1:Airwalk» has returned) and one of
the Finnish legends - »CL1:CNCD», »CL1:Parallax»
or »CL1:Complex». And while in Finland,
»CL1:Sonik» might also return with another 
great 64k to take our breath away!
Apart from this, double membership
will become even more normal, due to
the way people gets to know eachother
via IRC, groups will 'borrow members'
from eachother, and the best musicians
and graphicians will get lots and lots
of things released, whereas up and
coming talents will have a harder
time.


The multinational internet groups will
always be good for a release or two,
which means that groups like »CL1:Scoopex»,
»CL1:Nah-Kolor», »CL1:Mystic», »CL1:Haujobb» and »CL1:Depth»
(yup, I believe in my group!) will be 
on the rise.

     »PIC:Acid2.iff»












The domination of the »CL7:Finnish &
Swedish» scene will continue in some
way, making the Scandinavian continent
the most important, scene-wise, some
of the unknown Swedish & Finnish
groups mentioned above will become
more known, while others will leave
for the more famous groups.

»CL7:The Polish scene» will continue in the
same style, as we all know, today many
good graphicians come from Poland
(Lazur, Kazik, Fame, Zefir, Mustafa,
Acid, ... and all the forgotten ones),
and we will see a slideshow or two as
well from these people.
One or two new coding stars will be
born, we have yet to see who, but one
of them will be spotted at The Party
7!
Well, I have decided to try my luck at
a list of active demogroups - sorry to
anyone I might have forgotten:

other countries too.
