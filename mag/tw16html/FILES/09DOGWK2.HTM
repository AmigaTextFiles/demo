The baby, wrapped in a blanket and

It is thought that, while the killer concentrates mainly on older people,
he is nevertheless capable of showing some compassion.  The police in
Shropshire are, even now, searching for this man, quite how he was able
to simply walk out of Telford station is uncertain, especially after the
country-wide notice that was issued.</FONT>
