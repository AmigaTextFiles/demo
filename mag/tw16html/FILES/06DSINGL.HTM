<font color =#FFFFFF>                              by Dan Wood
<font color =#DCFF4C>
Yeah  I've totally ripped off Bolty's idea, but hey who cares?  I've got
TONS  of singles, I get about 25 free a week (get on promo lists people,
they're cool :) So I grabbed a handfull, so let's see what we got:

(A lot of these are quite old though! :)

1. No Surrender - Deuce

Call  me  a  sad git, but this is a cool song, and no longer available I
think.   I  have  disc  1 of 2, but the tight gits never sent me disc 2!
Thanks  people, apparantly disc two has a remix of "On The Bible", but i
can't  confirm  that.   A 3 track CD, a radio ed, extended, and a dreamy
dancey mix.  Cool.

2. Wrong - Everything But The Girl

6  track CD, sounds awfully like "Missing" but it's better than missing,
like  most discs it has the radio edit, and a few extended mixes.  Quite
a good song, but not heard of much these days.

3. Pacific Melody - Airscape

This  CD  has 4 tracks, and it's one of these dancey, dreamy songs, it's
not  bad, but it's best when mixed in with other songs I think.  A brand
new song as well, dunno if it's out to buy yet though.

4. Please Don't Go - No Mercy

Sounds  a lot like "Where Do You Go", this CD has 4 tracks, and is still
available,  also  has  a remix of "Where Do You Go" which is actually on
the  "Where  Do  You Go" CD, cheek!  This song is STILL on the radio all
the  time,  but it's alright I guess, nothing special, I'm a bit sick of
this one.  So I'll eat it :)

5. The Real Thing - Lisa Stansfield

Lisa's second recent tune since her 'come back'.  Not a bad song, but it
gets tiring quickly, 5 track CD with a few remixes.  Ok....

6. We Trying To Stay Alive - Wyclef Jean (from Fugees)

Apart from the appauling grammar of the title :) Not a bad song, a remix
of the Begees old tune, and Wyclef's first solo release.  Taken from his
forthcoming  album  "Carnival"  Only  a 3 track CD, with one remix and a
song  called  "Imagino"  which  is crap.  I have another CD of this song
with different stuff on somewhere, but I didn't get this one out.

7.  Get Up (Everybody) - Byron Stingily

Hmmn,  interesting  song, I don't know why, but it works!  It's released
on Judge Jules label "Manifesto" so it has the standard boring Manifesto
CD  cover, they're all the same zzzz, which is difficult to find the one
you  want  when you have about 30 CDs all with the same cover.  5 tracks
on this disc.

8. People of Love - Amen (UK)

I  grabbed  CD  2  out of the storage vault :) (well the racks) 'cos the
best  thing  about  this is that it has "Passion" on it, which is a cool
song.   People  of  Love,  is a pretty boring song, and hasn't done that
well.   It's  nothing  too hot.  4 Tracks, including "Passion" (original
radio edit).

9. Get Busy - Mr Lee

A pretty crappy discoey dancey song, it sucks, avoid it.  4 tracks.

10. Insomnia - Faithless

Remember  this  one  from  last year?  BIG tune last winter, and the big
money  earner  for  Faithless.  Top tune, the newer remixes aren't here,
but the classic mixes (all 5 of them) are on here, good CD.

11. Fired Up! - Funky Freen Dogs

5  track  disc,  top tune, just get their album "Get Fired Up", it kicks
arse!   This  is  a  cool dance song, and has the popular DDDDeep mix by
Angel Moraes.

12. Lovefool - The Cardigans

Tod  Terry's  remixes  are on here, a 3 track CD, that's ALWAYS on radio
stations and TV.  Did VERY well in the charts, and a pretty catchy song,
not bad at all.  Was also on the movie "Romeo And Juliette".

13. 'Aint Nobody - LL COOL J

Another  in  the  recent  remixes  of  the old 80s tune by Chakka Kahn &amp;
Rufus,  and although not as good as the original, it's still the best of
the  recent remixes.  This was also on the movie "Beavis and Butthead do
America".  3 tracks including an instrumental.

14. You Are The Universe - The Brand New Heavies

A  song  I've  grown  quickly  tired  of,  and  has  faded in popularity
recently.   It has 5 mixes on, I've heard all of track 1 (the one that's
on  TV and radio) and track 4.  Track 4 is the best mix, the others I've
had  a brief listen to, but ended up skipping past them, because they're
crap.

15. Around The World - Daft Punk

Taken  from Daft Punk's album "Homework".  Has 4 tracks on it, the radio
edit,  an  extended mix from "Homework", a track called "Teachers" which
is  funny,  but  quite  catchy,  and it lists a whole host of top DJs by
calling  their  names  out, like when you do "role" or the "registar" at
school.   How  funny  it  would  be if real teachers said "In tha house"
after  your  name  :) And there's a crap "Motorbass vice mix" of "Around
The  World"  which is crap, but the rest of the CD gets top marks!!  See
Daft  Punk  at V97 (which you'll have missed by the time you see this :)
even better than "Da Funk", roll on Daft Punk's next single!

16. Let's Groove - Phat 'n' Phunky

Interesting song, that was quietly released, and then slipped away a few
months  ago  (but I've had the vinyl since last year).  It's a remake of
"Let's  Groove" by Earth, Wind and Fire!  From back in the 70s.  Cool as
well,  has  a  mix  from  DJ  Supreme.  I want "Boogie Wonderland" to be
remixed :)

17. In Loving Memory of the Notorious B.I.G - Tribute to B.I.G

Has  the  number  one song "I'll Be Missing You" as the main attraction,
which  is a rework of The Police's 80s song "Every Breath You Take", and
a powerful song, you can hear the pain of B.I.G's widow "Faith Evans" in
the  lyrics, also sung by Puff Daddy and LL2.  Plus the intrumental, and
a crap song called "We'll always miss big pappa".

18. Tarantino's New Star - North And South

Had  this  since  about  June, not bad, quite catchy, one of those songs
that  sticks in your mind.  Has 6 mixes, one by The Porn Kings, but only
the  first  two  tracks  (radio  and  super  paradise  mixes)  are worth
mentioning, the other mixes don't have many lyrics, and crap tunes.  But
good song.

19. Amour (c'mon) Plus Up To no Good - Porn Kings

This  CD  has  their  recent  song  "Amour"  on  there,  and three mixes
(including  the original mix) of "Up To No Good", which is alright.  Not
bad at all.

20. RIPGROOVE - Double 99

Wow!   This song totally rocks!  One of THE best dance tunes i have ever
heard.  Has a sample from Armand Van Helden's mix of "Sugar Is Sweeter",
that  "beep beep beep" sample that all songs seem to be using this time.
And has a kind of sound from "Never Let him go" (the intro), 4 tracks, 3
mixes,  and  a supplement song (which sucks).  But it's definately worth
getting.

Right that's all!
