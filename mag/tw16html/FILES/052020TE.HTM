<font color =#FFFFFF>                      2020 Technology - by Phil97
                      ---------------------------
<font color =#D0FFFF>
Ok,  I'll  stick  my  neck  out and give some of my predications for the
world  of  technology for the year 2020.  Nothing outrageously unlikely,
just evolved forms of todays stuff...


Televisions
-----------

With  the cathode ray tube finally dead and buried, TV screens just look
like  pieces of glass that'll hang on the wall.  The whole concept of TV
as  a  pseudo social centre-piece-of-the-home vanishes.  RF broadcasting
fizzles out; Everyone has a 2 way cable connection.

Video Recorders
---------------

VHS  is  dead and rotting in hell!  As if it shouldnt be already!  There
probably  wont be much need for video recorders anyway as programmes and
films  (which  will be 3D epics where computer generated actors and sets
are indistinguishable from reality) will be available on demand.

Computers
---------

People  have  always  shunned  products  that  attempt to merge the home
computer  and  other  "entertainment  media"  but these have always been
half-assed  novelties.   Once the true information super highway is with
us,  it'll make perfect sense to access the internet / games / TV / HIFI
via  the  home's  "info-centre",  which  may  well  have  a  verbal user
interface.   The  whole  system will live in a little cupboard under the
stairs, which only needs to be accessed to plug in upgrade modules etc.
 
Internet
--------

The internet becomes indistinguishable from TV, except for its real-time
interactivity and voice-of-the-masses aspects.

(Mobile) Phones
---------------

BTs  archaic  analogue  system  is long gone.  The phone merges into the
homes info centre.  Live video of the caller is taken for granted (costs
more!).   Mobiles  become  video  wristwatches or a general smart credit
card  thing.   Any data from the home base info-centre can be redirected
to the personal mobile.

Cars
----

Fossil fuels are judged too valuable, expensive and polluting for use in
cars.   Old  folk  moan  but more mellow people embrace new eco-frienldy
electric  (or  hydrogen  power)  vehicles cus they didnt see the need to
roar  about  at  120+mph  anyway.   Roads become less congested cus more
people work from home.

Power Generation
----------------

Old  nuclear  power  stations are phased out and the new fusion reactors
come on line.  Power bills drop drastically.

Medicine
--------

Due  to  the  mapping  of  the whole of human DNA, much understanding is
gained  about  genetic  diseases  and how to test for / cure them.  Many
such diseases are completely wiped out with gene-therapy.
