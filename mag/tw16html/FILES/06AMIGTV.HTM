Hey!   The  Amiga's  just  been on the telly!  Some BBC2 open university
type  jobby.   It  was  showing  how  educational games can be for kids,
telling  mum  and dad to buy a computer, not a console for the kids.  Of
course  the  star  of  the  show  was  the  old A500!  They showed track
building in Jaguar XJ220, filmed in Game, or may be the old Future Zone.
There  was a big "Amiga" sign in the background.  Other shots showed the
kiddies playing Lemmings and Monkey Island 2 at home.

Reminds  me  of the good old days when the miggy was actually advertised
on  TV.   The  A500  addy showing "Another World" was okay, but the CD32
thing with that dodgy plastic robot was just plain funny.  Ha, ha!

word?  Kei]
