Hey,  hey!  *I* wrote the first ever article on "What's on my desk" !  -
I think.

Right then, first of all, a dodgy sketch of my bedroom ......

ZONE  1  is  where my bed covers fall off in the night.  So keeping this
area clean at all times is a high priority.

Yes,  I  know  my  miggy is in a weird position.  The corner of the desk
points  directly into mah knackers, so I could lose my family pension if
I get up a bit too quick.
<font color =#A0FF4C>
I  still  haven't  moved  all  my  stuff  in.  And there's also mags/etc
littered on the floor.  Bah.
<font color =#FFD0C4>
Whoops, this was supposed to be about what I had on my desk, and not the
layout of my bedroom.  Oh, and this ISN'T an invitation to burgle me!!

<font color =#FFFF4C>[This  may  prompt  some  articles  on  art  deco  or  interia design or
something.  Or who has the best room layout etc..  Kei]
