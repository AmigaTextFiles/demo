Kane  &lt;kane49@mail.idt.net&gt;  AKA The Old Wolf Last edited 5-4-96 (still
some changes to make but I've been out of town (again))
 
-------- 
Kane's  Komments:   A story is a story is a story, whether it stem from a
fanciful  critique of anothers art or just a raw tale ya gotta pound out.
Do  it  to  it!  Some of the most fun I had in this group (some time ago)
was  with  a  short  critique  in the form of a story that several others
joined  in  on.   Wasn't long, but it was a blast.  Enough static, here's
the deal.....
 
* What is alt.cyberpunk.chatsubo? 
 
It is a group for encouraging creativity along the lines of the cyberpunk
genre.   It  is  a  group  where  posting prose, song lyrics, poetry, and
interactive fiction is all appropriate and encouraged.  The definition of
'cyberpunk'  is  still pretty much in the air, (and always will be, thats
it's  nature) but most of it is based on near future, dark/bleak outlook,
and  technology beyond what society and human emotions can sometimes deal
with  (technoshock).   It  was  also  created  to get all this off of the
purely  fact  and  non-fiction oriented alt.cyberpunk, so that they don't
have to be bothered with this fiction/speculative stuff.
 
* Are there any rules? 
 
Seems like the general consensus is as follows 
 
1)  Give  feedback!   If someone writes something you like, tell them so!
If  you don't like it, tell them!  Everyone writing here is writing to be
read, and we want to know what -YOU- think.
  
2)  Participate!   Write  something yourself.  Join in a conversation,
join  in  a  storyline,  start  up  something yourself.  "It's good to be
involved..."
   
3)  Be  Considerate!  If you decide to participate in a storyline, be
sure  to  be  considerate  of  the  efforts  others  have made.  Don't go
whomping  on  continuity.  If you make changes in a story, or use someone
else's character - get permission!  Basically, use your brain.
 
One  additional  thing  that I'd like to put here is that if someone is
inconsiderate,  inform  them  of the mistake in email, first.  Try not to
ascribe  to  malice what might simply be cluelessness.  After that, there
is  a playground sorta rule in that if someone's stomping on things right
and  left,  they  can  be  very easily ignored into inexistance.  Flaming
someone  that  is  fishing for the negative response is exactly what they
are  looking for, so let them wait for it.  (Ed note, "Unless it's a SPAM
advertisement..  then let them have it!")
 
 
* What are these ADMIN postings? 
 
As  an  exact  opposite  for  most other groups, instead of marking story
pieces, all things which *aren't* story should be flagged with the string
ADMIN  in  the  subject  header.   Discussion  of how groups work for the
interactive fiction is encouraged.
 
 
* I'm completely new to this place.  Where do I start? 
 
A good place to start is with as much cyberpunk literature as you can get
your  hands  on.   Some  folks like using the Shadowrun (TM) or CyberPunk
(TM)  games  for  a  starting point, beginning characters are pretty well
limited  and  can  be  very  interesting.   Most, however, make their own
virtual  cyberpunk  reality  up.  There are, presently, about five or six
shade  of  VR  on  the Chat at the moment, and were mostly made up by the
people  that  wanted  to  play in them.  So make up your own if you don't
particularly  feel  comfortable  with  what's  there.  The one thing that
isn't  subject  to do-it-yourself is the Chatsubo itself, as the bar is a
nexus for a number of stories and there is already some consensus on what
is  there.   The keyword is 'some'.  If you want to get a feel for what's
happened  in  the  bar,  check out the archives listed at the end of this
article.
 
Here's the short list for reading. 
 
Burning Chrome, Count Zero and Mona Lisa Overdrive by William Gibson 
Hardwired by Walter Jon Williams 
Islands in the Net, Schismatrix by Bruce Sterling 
Lethal Interface, Stalker Analog by Mel Odom 
Snow Crash by Neal Stephanson 
Bolos by Keith Laumer (see into the mind of an A.I. war machine) 
Battle Angel Alita by Yukito Kishiro (manga/comic) 
Many more than I could list here. 
 
Some Cyber-style Videos/Movies: 
Bladerunner 
Nemesis 
Split Second 
Lawnmower Man (for Virtual Reality) 
The Robocop and Terminator movies 
Freejack (There's an original cp storyline) 
Hardware 
Akira (anime) 
Bubblegum Crisis (anime) 
 
* Should I use the bar in my stories? 
 
Most of the interactive fiction is centered around the bar, the Chatsubo,
as  created  by William Gibson and embellished by the folks of the group.
Ratz  and  Lonny  Zone  and  his girls are all from the books.  (The word
chatsubo  ==  'cha'  =  tea  + 'tsubo' = pot/bowl).  In _Neuromancer_ the
Chatsubo is in an English speaking section of the Sprawl around Chiba, in
Japan.   But  the location of the bar in this group is TBD by anyone that
wants  to  play  in/around/with  it.   The stories have had it in Boston,
along  the  Eastern  Seaboard, in Chiba, in Seattle, in Ohio, in Chicago,
and  in  unknown  worlds.  The year has been 2050, 2020,2029, 2035, 2033,
etc...  usually in the next century plus some, depending on how far along
you think your technology is.
 
One  reason  to  play  with the Chatsubo as part of the story is that the
story  will  get  more  readership.   People *like* being acknowledged in
someone  else's  posts  and  are  flattered  when  they make a big enough
impression to be included in someone else's story, even as a cameo.
 
*  As  far  as  who else is at the Chatsubo, Someone else whose Address I
lost  like a schmo is handling the databases now, post an ADMIN:  request
for them and he'll probably spot it and bounce it for ya.
 
* Can I use magic in my stories? 
 
Is it your story? ;) 
 
*  Should  I  copyright  my  stories?  What do publishers think about Net
published stories?
 
Yes,  it's  a  good idea to put a copyright notice on all your fiction if
you're  thinking  about  getting  published.  The legal form is Copyright
&lt;date&gt; by &lt;Name&gt;.  (c) and (C) do not count as copyright symbols.  In the
U.S.   and  a  number  of other countries, there is actually an automatic
copyright  for  written material, wheither or not it has the notice.  The
notice,  however, can't hurt, and it may help someone remember to respect
your  rights  as  an  author.  You're going to have to ask the publishers
you're  interested  in  publishing  with about their opinions on what Net
publication is.  Some don't regard it as a publication, some do regard it
as  a  first time publication to a public access forum.  From my paranoid
point  of  view,  it's best to regard posting it to the Net as making the
story public domain.
 
As  Tim  Kuehn  pointed  out, it isn't really public domain, as you still
will  have  all the legal rights to the piece.  The trick is in enforcing
those  rights.  A copyright notice informs the honest and uninformed.  It
doesn't always work.  I've had a friend who found one of his stories in a
magazine with someone else's name on the by-line.  The original story had
a  copyright  notice  on it.  The only way to completely protect yourself
from  that  kind  of  fooey  is to register the copyright as well at your
local  copyright  office.   It's  cheap  and easy insurance if you really
think  you  have  something  hot,  and it's something any aspiring author
ought to know about anyway.
 
 
* If you might lose your story, why the heck post it? 
 
Because it's fun. 
 
Because  there is no other medium in the world where you can publish your
own  stuff  in  whatever form it might happen to fall out of the keyboard
in.   Because  you  can  experiment  and  get instant feedback.  Not only
feedback  of  the  "I  *loved* it."/"I hated it." kind, but feedback from
other  writers as you see them take off with an idea that you only hinted
at.   Because  it's  fun  to  create characters that other people take an
interest  in  and  actually  enjoy not only reading about but speculating
about   and   tell   you   what   they   think  about  them  pretty  much
instantaneously.
 
I've had stories and articles that I've worked with and on published in a
book  and  magazines, and all my friends tell me that they can't, for the
life  of  them, find either the book or the magazines.  They can all find
the  Net.   I  find that I'm not in it for the money, I'm in it because I
love to write and I love having an audience.
 
* Some story/character guidelines that may be thrown out if you like: 
 
Parodies are *WONDERFUL* and are well accepted here, and they break every
guideline  that  follows.   The  biggest thing is to Have Fun Interesting
characters  aren't  ones  that  are all-powerful.  This isn't a place for
'My-character-can-beat-up-your-character-dick-waving'.    It's  pointless
and  uninteresting  for  most readers.  If someone asks 'What is the most
interesting thing about your character?" and the only answer is something
like  "the  90mm  cannon mounted in her ----" then it's time to think the
character  over  again.   The  same  holds for magic, as well.  Unlimited
magic is wish fulfillment and makes for a bad basis for a story.
 
A  good story has tension, suspence, emotional involvement by the reader.
If  a  character is obviously going to mow over everything in their path,
then there simply is no point to it.
 
This  goes for groups as well as singles.  If a 'group' can pull everyone
that  it  might ever need out of a hat, it gets boring.  It's also a good
idea  to have a designated 'bad guy' if a story is a polarization between
good  and  bad,  because then the bad guys aren't just idiots that can be
steamrollered.  Again...  a playing for style as opposed to munchkinism.
 
One  particular thing to be avoided is creating brainless cretins just so
that  your  character  can  disembowl, slice and dice, and generally make
soup  out of simply to show how 'bad' your character can be.  Again, it's
boring and pointless and should bring on the cops or whoever and whatever
gang,  corp,  or  organization  that  poor  shmuck  belonged to.  Without
consequences, any action is pointless.
 
 
* Where can I find archives of old stories and articles? 
 
There  is  anoynmous  FTP  access  from  catalina.opt-sci.arizona.edu (IP
number 128.196.206.60) under pub/chatsubo.  Articles there with nekoko.XX
are  Nekoko's  story,  articles  with  chatsubo.XX  are  collected a.c.c.
articles,  chatsubo.00  contains  articles predating the formation of the
group.    Some  articles,  stories,  and  administration  stuff  are  not
archived.  Please restrict FTP'ing to evening and weekends.  Thanks.
 
You  may  also  wish  to  visit Vektor's personal archive on the web at
http:///www.magi.com/~vektor/chatsubo/.
 
(Ed  note:   Several other archives were referenced, but they appear to
be gone now).
 
There are other archives of other material, usually if you really enjoy
a  story  line ask the author/authors for archives and they might best be
able to tell you.

					Have a blast...
