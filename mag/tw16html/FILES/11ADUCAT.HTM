<FONT COLOR=#FFddFF>Everyone who's read Pratchett books will have done it at some stage
or other, and that is to turn to one of the first few pages of any
of the books and consult the list entitled "Books by Terry Pratchett"
with the express intention of going through them to see if they've
got them all.  "The Unadulterated Cat" is up there on the list but
very few people have actually read it, even fewer have actually seen
a copy of it.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#FFE6D3>As it has been reprinted this year, I got a friend
in Sheffield to
mail it to me (see?  Can't get it in Grimsby!) so that I could have
a quick read.  I didn't know what to expect but I was quite sure it
wouldn't be anything like a Discworld novel...</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#C4ECD3>Correct.  TAC is one of those novelty books that
people buy when they
are stuck for a present. "Aaah" thinks they, "Wossname's got a cat,
we'll buy her this!".  It's that sort of book, a funny opinion of a
book, you know the sort.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#C4ECFF>It goes on about "Real" cats - Real cats don't
do this, real cats do
that, and while the thing gets a wee bit dull after a while, there
are some right gems `twixt the covers, such as the one about the veg-
etarian cat, or the cat that mugged another cat on a regular basis.

<FONT COLOR=#FFE3FF>True, very true, Deck the Ripper will tell you
all about the time he
found a webbed foot in the kitchen...</FONT>
<P>
And as for the games that cats play, well...
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#CDE3FF>This isn't a bad book, no no, it's quite good,
 but you're not going
to enjoy it if you buy it expecting it to be as good as the Discworld
stuff, or the Nomes trilogy.  This is a different book entirely, and
is more suited to cat lovers than Pratchett fans, unless, of course,
they just want to complete their set.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#CDE3C7>It's an okay book, it is average, in a nice 
competant way, and would
make a good gift for the aforementioned cat lover, but it a bit of a
let-down if you're execting a riotous laughing session.</FONT>
