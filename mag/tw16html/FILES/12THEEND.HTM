                      - we at the Word believe, it was the rooster!

 Thank god I can finally put another issue of The Word to bed.  I always
seem  to  start work on the next issue several days before the deadline.
When  will  I  learn?   Oh well..  if you've gotten this far then you've
probably finished reading it.  What did you think?  Why not give us some
feedback.  We'd appreciate it.

 I'm  starting  to  get settled in Ipswich now so by the time you do get
around to this I'll of probably located all the local dives and hangouts
and those places Dave Diamond writes about..

 Over  the  last few days while finishing this issue I decided to cruise
the  internet  to  check out what the other scene groups are up to these
days.   I  was  amazed  to  find that not every group is as dormant as I
first  assumed, they just moved onto the internet.  I have to say that I
was  pretty  damn  impressed  with  their  groups homepages.  It made my
little  HTML  v2  jobbie  look weak in comparrison.  Luckily for me I've
been  doing HTML v3, PERL and JAVA at work so expect a radical change on
the  Carnage  web  page  within  the  next  week.  It'll probably have a
cyberpunk  theme  to reflect my current state of mind but I'll make good
use  of  what  I've  learnt  in  order  to  make  it more dynamic.  Keep
surfing..

 Yep.   From  this issue, if you can't be bothered to turn on your Amiga
at  home  you  can use your school/work computer to read the Word!  Just
point your browser to the Word's web site.

 A  piece  of  news  that  crossed  my desk today is that the Word got a
mention  in August's edition of Amiga Format.  I believe it's on page 10
but as I haven't seen a copy yet, I cannot comment.


 Today  is  27/08/97.   According  to  the  internet,  it is the day the
fictional AI computer system SKYNET of the Terminator films came alive.
