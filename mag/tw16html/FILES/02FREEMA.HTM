Some time ago I wrote about a free E-Mail service being offered by a
company called The Electronic Market, and run on an 0800 number so that
the users incurred absolutely no cost whatsoever.
<P><FONT COLOR=#DCFCFF>
Unfortunately the decision has been made to axe the service after the
two main sponsors of the company decided to discontinue their support,
even though the decision had already been made to transfer the service
to an 0345 number - a move that would have slashed operational costs.

FreeMail will finish at the end of September this year, the company has
apologised to it's customers and users, but this still means that five
thousand people - myself included - will be forced to change their mail
addresses or find themselves cut off from the world of global comms that
they have so recently discovered.
</FONT><P>
Expect to see changes from anyone with an E-Mail address in the format:
<P>
<CENTER><FONT COLOR=#DCD2FF>UserName@emarkt.com</FONT></CENTER>

I personally am considering services from about four different ISPs for
my new address, which I will tell people about once it is settled.
Remember, always check the Word E-Mail Directory before contacting any
Word reader by E-Mail.</FONT></FONT></B>
