SHIT!!!!!!!!!!  Just read your message in issue 14.  WHAT THE **** did I
do  to  get  such  a word thrashing????  Sheesh,I recently sent you some
Jenny  Powell  pictures  `n`  all  and  there you were calling me a sad,
pervert  all  along.   Oh  deary  me,  was  this  a bit of fun or was it
serious?  Whatever it was - that HURT man.


To: "Correspondant"
Fm: Dave Diamond

Yeah,yeah VERY funny I`m SURE!  I am of course referring to the `Diamond
Fakes  It` article in TW14.  Some funny parts but you got it wrong!  The
cameras  were  full size - not minis!  I dont think miss Hart would take
too kindly to your comments either - that`s slander that is!


To: All readers
Fm: Dave Diamond

After reading TW14 and finding out that D!ck has some sort of death wish
against   me   for   some   bizarre   reason  and  thet  the  MYSTERIOUS
`Correspondant`  pokes  fun  at my depressing situations I`m starting to
think  that  you  dont like my adult articles that contain all this self
praise.   Well if that`s the fact then dont read them!  I write articles
for The Word to help keep the magazine at the number one spot.  Consider
this  my `friends` if you didn`t have me then you would have SO, SO many
articles pouring in through the months now would you?


To: Kei
Fm: Dave Diamond

Sorry  there  weren`t  many  articles  for issue 14,they just didn`t get
there  on  time  by the sounds of it.  Besides I was holding back at one
stage so you would have about 50 articles to include.


To: Kei and everyone else reading.
Fm: Dave Diamond.

Just  to  let  you know that I have just counted how many NEW articles I
have to send to The Word disk-magazine.

100 baby!
100!
Surely I AM the king of article writing!

They`ll reach your tv screens...soon!


To: Kei
Fm: Dave Diamond

In  future to save you work and for more people to SEE my articles, dont
bother  in  adding  any  color to the text.  Just the bog standard color
will do.


To: All readers
Fm: Dave Diamond

Just  to say that if you weren`t able to read my articles in past issues
of  The  Word because of color code clashes then you can obtain whatever
articles  you  want  from  me personally.  This also includes the `adult
articles`  although  you  still have to be 18 - or have already have had
sex  to  read them!  Send a s.a.e plus a disk to my usual address to get
them!


To: All readers 2!
Fm: Dave Diamond

Hi  again!  This time I`m here to tell you that if you want to print out
ANY  of  my  articles  past, present or future and distribute them among
friends  or  pin  them up in your college or school then by all means do
so!  Just remember to delete my address from them first!

If  anyone  has  these  disks  then  please  send  them to me as soon as
possible £1 per disk will be given to anyone who has them.

                     RISE OF THE DRAGON DISK 4 ONLY
                            SUMMER OLYMPIAD
                               T.C.K ART
                        WAXWORKS CRACKED DISK 1

If  anyones interested I think Phantom has them but he`s stopped trading
with me now and I`ve been looking for these disks for over 4 years!!!

To: D!ck
Fm: kenco/carnage

Y'know,  I  prefer  calling  you  Freak  than  d!ck.   It's  kind  of  a
psychological thing that says "Whatever you do, never call anyone dick."
I  mean,  it's  like,  Freak, baby, inna house, respect to tha man, yeh,
well  'ard  sorta fing, ya gettin' ma vibe?  But..er..  dick?  You can't
get  away  with  saying  "How's  it hangin', dick?" It sort of implies a
direct  question,  rather  than the usual indirect one, as in "Does your
todger  lay  to the left or to the right, my friend?" Say this to anyone
and  it's  guaranteed  they'll  avoid  you  for  the rest of their life.
Anyway,  in  answer  to your views last issue, I changed my handle for a
good  reason, I finally got the system I had been longing for and it was
going to change the way I worked with my amiga, so I felt the need for a
change  of  identity, as you do.  I wanted a handle to have a "c" or "k"
in it, so that it had alliteration with carnage.  When you say "Kenco of
Carnage",   it   kind   of  rolls  off  the  tongue.   Besides,  I  love
alliteration, apart from it being a long word.


To: Phantom/Syndicate
Fm: kenco/carnage

Where  are  you?   I sent some disks a while back in the hope of getting
some  more stuff off you (for a price ;) Could I at least have the disks
and  maybe a letter back?  Please note the change of address in the text
ads!


To: Amida
Fm: kenco

Heheh,  cool system you've got lined up for yourself m8y!  Wouldn't mind
seeing it all running!  Send in a snapshot of your workbench in cid when
you've got it all!!


To: Kei
Fm: kenco

Soz  about the vid m8.  Hope the vids compensate for the lack of trust I
have  in  Tony  now.  Ah well..  nice job on TW14.  Now that The Word is
net-bound,  it  really  is  gaining  a  lot  of recognition!  People are
starting to take it seriously as a disk mag!  Plus with the Carnage name
tagged  on, we'll start to be recognised as a uk group world-wide!  Yeh!
I  reckon  Iceman  or  Eon  should  devote some space for Word issues by
nfa/crn  and  crn.   Then  there's  Phreaking Only, Sensual Kittens (the
coded  ones  would be best put on).  Also the new things up and coming -
once  Ruiner  gets  his  head  screwed  on,  the House Megamix Demo will
finally be released.  It really is coming together now, eh?


To: The inventor of the laser-pen
Fm: kenco

Cheers for such a cool..er..thing!  I point mine through the curtains at
night  into  peoples  bedrooms  and  see how far it can go before I lose
track of it.  Cool!


To: Kenco/Carnage
Fm: Kei/Carnage

Todays  the  day  I start copying the Word onto all those diskback jiffy
disks  but  I  find  a  jiffy  from you on my doormat instead so feeling
generous I take the time to go back into the Word and insert your stuff.
Let's not cut it so fine next time ok?  ;)
