PART FOUR

The Search For Donna

Just  when  you thought it was all over and you had the crown, the train
gets  held  up by a group of Russian radicals working for Doctor Virago,
who  have  stopped the train to steal the coffin that RJ bought from the
Kremlin.   They  have  also  stopped  the  train,  under orders from the
Doctor, to kidnap a young virgin!  Donna is taken hostage.

Now  the  boys,  Doug and Dino, must rescue the fair maiden.  First find
the path to the bridge and start to give chase.  After tramping for many
a  mile,  you will find the path to the bridge.  Follow this bridge over
to  the  village  after getting Dino and Doug to clear the boulders from
the  side  and  throw them into the water to allow safe passage over the
icy river.  Cross the river and head into the village, which is a gloomy
place  where  time seems to have stood still.  The villagers appear wary
of our strange heroes.

Walk through the town and take control of Doug.  Pick up the lantern and
the  icicles  hanging from the small blue building spotting that Zelda's
caravan is in this village.  Go into the caravan and talk to Zelda.  She
tells you that Donna is in mortal danger so if you want to save her then
you  must  follow Zelda's instructions.  She will tell you that the only
way  to  get into the house is by magic but, alas, Zelda has been robbed
of  her  potions.   Zelda will then give you a list of things to get for
her  in order to make up a fresh batch of potions and help you to rescue
Donna.  The list is:

         Dead Man's Bones
         Bat's Wings
         Lion's Tooth
         Sunflower Seeds

Start off by heading into the graveyard next door and pick up the bottle
and  the  bones.   Combine  the  lantern and the bottle to make a superb
whisky  and  give  it  to the gravedigger.  Now talk to him about Doctor
Virago  and  he  will  tell  you of a madman who lives in a villa in the
woods.   They  say that the madman can raise the dead, which sounds like
Doctor  Virago  all right!  Return to the village square and walk to the
right  of  the  screen  until  you  come  across  a  wooden shack with a
drainpipe  on  the  side.   Get  Dino  to pick up the drainpipe and then
change  back to Doug.  Head into the little square next to the shack and
pick up the tarpaulin covering the pile of wood.

Now  change  to  Dino again and select your music box and play it to the
old  man  sitting  on  the  side.   The  old man will say that the music
reminds  him  of  his childhood and will fall asleep.  Once he's asleep,
take  the  spectacles  from his face and then turn your attention to the
tower  next to the man.  Combine the spectacles and the drainpipe making
a  pair of binoculars then select the icicles and use them on the church
tower  to make a ladder.  Now pick up the stone found at the base of the
tower and proceed to climb up the tower.  At the belfry select the stone
and  use  it on the bell.  This will create a loud tone, waking the bats
inside  the  bell  tower.   Capture  a  bat  by  getting Dino to use the
tarpaulin as a net; this is another item on Zelda's list.

While  you're up the tower, tell Dino to select the binoculars.  He will
then be able to see the Doctor's villa in the middle of the woods, North
of the village.  Climb down the tower and head out into the woods.  Once
in  the  woods,  herad  to the villa and walk around the woods until you
come  across a squirrel's hole, where you will find the sunflower seeds.
Once  you  find the villa, pick up the lion's tooth (you will have to be
pixel-perfect  when  locating it on the left hand lion's mouth) and head
back  to  Zelda  to  deliver  the  goods.   When  you arrive back at the
caravan, give the items to Zelda in the following order:

         Sunflower Seeds
         Bat
         Lion's Tooth
         Bones

Zelda  will  then exit and make up the potion, returning to tell you not
to  drink it until you are at the villa gates.  Proceed to the villa now
and,  on  arrival,  make  Doug drink the potion, turning him into a bat.
Once inside the villa, take control of Donna once again.

                            Inside The Villa

Donna  is meeting her kidnapper, Doctor Virago.  The mad doc has his eye
on  our  Donna  as a perfect specimen for his great experiment!  Talk to
the doctor and he will get upset and slam the door behind him.  Now it's
time  for Donna to help herself in preparation for Doug's arrival.  Pick
up  the  perfume  bottle  and open the pillow so that the stuffing comes
out.  Now pick up one of the feathers and look at the ceiling.  You will
notice  that  there  is  a  trapdoor  in  the ceiling above the bed.  Go
through the door to arrive in another room.

You  will  now  be  in  a  dusty  attic  room  with many unusual objects
scattered  around.  Pick up the record, magpie and bottle of chloroform.
Combine the chloroform and the perfume bottle and go back down into your
room.  Now select the perfume bottle with it's new concoction and use it
on  the  guard outside the door.  Now walk down the stairs and enter the
room  containing  the  bowl  of fruit, located under the stairs.  Try to
pick  up  the bust on the right and Donna will drop it.  Now pick up one
of  the  broken  pieces and find that it's made out of plaster.  Pick up
the bowl of fruit and the vase.

Enter  the lounge and go into the doctor's study, located over the other
side  of  the  passage.   Go straight over to the skeleton and look into
it's eyes to discover a key.  Add it to your inventory.  Now look inside
the  big clock to the left and pick up the iron filings inside.  Combine
the record and the filings, breaking the record into little bits.  Next,
select  the key and use it to open the cabinet on the right hand side of
the study.  Pick up the jar of bat wings and take the books on the table
and  shelves.   Read  them and then pick up the pen on the desk.  One of
the  books  will tell you how to create electrostatic and the other book
will  be  the  doctor's diary, with an entry about the Book Of The Dead.
There are also strange spells written down and then the diary goes on to
describe  an  experiment  that succeeded in bringing back a subject from
the dead!

Go over to the desk beside the ashtray made out of a skull.  Put the bat
wings,  fruit and feather in it.  Something forms in the ashtray - could
this be beginner's luck finding a potion to bring the dead back to life?
Use the fountain pen in the ashtray to stir the mixture.  Head back into
the  lounge  and  make your way back upstairs to the room where you were
held captive.  Go into the attic, use the plaster on the floor to make a
circle in which Intel Outside appears!  Now combine the fountain pen and
the  bird  and the colour of it's eyes changes.  Put the bird inside the
circle  and  use  the broken record on the gramophone player.  A strange
power comes from the gramophone and enters the dead bird, bringing it to
life!

Go  into  the bedroom and the magpie follows you.  Make your way outside
the  room and along to the doctor's bedroom which is situated next door.
At  this  point  talk to the bird and he will fly into the bedroom, past
the  sleeping  doctor  to get a set of keys.  Return to your bedroom and
use  the  keys  on  the window to open it, then throw the plant pot out.
This lands on the guard's head and knocks him out.  Donna can now simply
walk  down the stairs, open the front door using the key and escape from
the  villa.   Donna  will unfortunately be captured by a second guard at
the door - oh no!  not again!!

The  action  now shifts to the doctor's study where he is talking to his
assistant,  Igor.  He will ask Igor to get some bat wings and he will go
off  to look for some and catch one hovering around the villa.  Could it
be  our  Doug?   Meanwhile,  in  the basement, Doctor Virago is about to
carry  out  his  fiendish  plot.  A lifeless figure is chained up to the
strange  device.   It's  none  other  than  Lenin,  the  Grandfather  of
Communism!  What terrible fate awaits poor Donna?  Well for a start, the
doctor  is insisting that Donna takes her clothes off!  Once Donna is in
position,  the  doctor can now reach for the bat that Igor captured.  As
he does this, it turns into Doug, but what can our hero do?  Well, not a
lot  as  Doug  lunges  to  the machine to save Donna he activates it and
Lenin  is  reborn!  Don't worry, though.  The old Commie has a change of
heart  and  immediately  signs a contract to become the new presenter of
The  Russian  Doll  Show  on KGB TV.  Capitalism isn't that bad when you
have money to burn - after all, it's what makes the world go round!  But
what  of  our three heroes, Doug, Donna and Dino?  Well, all's well that
ends  well  as  they are now safely on their way to a new adventure in a
warmer place!!
