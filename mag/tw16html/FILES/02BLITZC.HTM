Hokay  then,  I've taken the liberty of creating a nice ickle ol' corner
in this fine organ (harumph indeed missus) for all things Blitzy.
<font color =#FFD0DC>
So  if  you've  got anything Blitz Basic 2 related, problems, tips, etc
then either send it/them to :

        BootBlock/TerraForm             or send it/them in as an article
        115 Corporation Road            and  I'll  try  my best to solve
        Grimsby                         your problem(s).  Or anyone else
        N.E. Lincs                      can if they feel like it.
        DN31 1UR                        I'm  good  at  all  things to do
                                        with Intuition, windows, etc.
But  I'm  not too hot when it comes to stuff about games and things like
that, but like I said, I'll try me best.  Go on, you know you want to!


<font color =#FFFF4C>[A Blitz corner eh?  An interesting idea but instead, how about a Coders
Corner?   I'm sure there are loads of coders out there who can code in a
whole  range  of  compiler,  interpreter and script languages so why not
write in with some tricks, tips and tutorials?  Kei]
