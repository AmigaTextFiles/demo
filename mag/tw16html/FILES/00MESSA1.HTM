 I  only brought 50% of my stuff down with me but have no fear as I will
get  the  rest shortly.  CID 46 should be ready soon as well.  I seem to
of  lost  communication  with  Mayhem,  Ruiner and Zebedee so if you are
reading this guys, give Amida a call on his Newcastle number or Kenco on
his  Stamford number to obtain my new number.  You'll find what you need
in back issues of CID.

 Thanks  for  the  support  at  the last minute.  I know you are feeling
disorientated  at  present  so  it  wasn't  easy.  We'll all get back to
normal  soon  enough.  Or at least as normal as we were before.  I don't
think  my  flat  is  big enough to hold gatherings in but guests will be
fine.


To: Iceman/Carnage
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 I was in two minds about using my new address as a diskback address due
to the neighbours.  Amida said you had volunteered your address but when
I  phoned  up to confirm your mam got weird on me and hung up on me!  So
it was a last minute decision.


To: Cage/Carnage
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 Hope  you  enjoy  your  new  house.  Living away from the folks is very
different.   You  finally  get to do what you want!  Swallow hard, close
your  eyes  and  hand  over  the money to BT mate asap so we can get the
board  back on-line.  I'll tell you how to get 8 months free ISP service
if you wish?


To: Kenco/Carnage
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 You missed the deadline even after all those calls I made!  A pity as I
wanted to see that new picture you said you were working on.  Re-work it
and stick a 17 in it for next issue.
 When  you  get  confirmation  on those new Pratchett titles then let me
know.   It'll make a change from the cyberpunk/hacker material I've been
digesting lately.  I could do with a laugh.


To: Wookie/Carnage

 Good  look  with  your  career  mate.  Can't see you having too much to
worry  about  going  by  that  music  CD you did.  Are we going to see a
comercial  release  soon?   If  you convert your music collection to MOD
then send me a copy.


To: Dick

 Cheers  for the support and the general wibble.  You have too much time
on your hands than is healthy mate.

 Check out my address in this issue and get in touch.


To: Andy Bolt
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 Can  you do some more cyberpunk images for me?  I can think of loads of
uses for it.  Cheers also for the support.


To: Bootblock/Terraform
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 The  article  on  your  brain was an insight and answered a few unasked
questions.   That colour util came in handy but there are a few problems
I've  noticed  so  feel free to get in touch via mail and we can come up
with  an  efficient program thay we can add to the Word's software suite
(well ok so it will make 2 pieces..)


To: Dave Diamond
Fm: Kei/Carnage

Cheers  for  the  "package"  it  er..   "came" in useful.  ;) Don't take
anything  in  this  issue  to  personally.  Write what you want but stay
within a healthy margin.


To: Ziploc/LOC
Fm: Kei/Carnage

Cheers for those favours. When I get a PSX I'll let you know.


To: Maffia
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 I got your email.  I'll get that information for you asap.  You are not
the  only  one  who  has to read the Word on a PC these days.  You'll be
suprised  how  many  PC  users  read the Word.  This issue the Word goes
on-line  completly  and not just to download the Amiga disk version.  So
you  don't  even  have to bother loading UAE anymore as you can use your
favourite web browser to read The Word!


To: Phil97
Fm: Kei/Carnage

 I seem  to  of  gotten myself into the habbit of emailing you, Dick and
Andy in moments of boredom so cheers for putting up with me.  ;)


To: Everyone

 The  Word is surviving at present with the help of it's regular readers
and the introduction of the Word on-line.  To see it last even longer we
would appreciate it if you took the time to write some articles and sent
them  in  to  us.   We  need  your  support.  Why not start work on that
science  fiction  piece you alwways wanted to write but never got around
to?  It could win you a prize.

Hey,  has  anyone heard a dance/techno/rave song that goes "I wanna fly,
painting rainbows in the sky ......  Rainbow Island!" ?

Is this about the most infamous Amiga game?  Sounds good though!

"I  kiss  your  lips  and close my eyes, I take you away to paradise, to
show everyone that I love you and you love meeee ..."

Ahh...  ain't that a sweet dance songy ?  Ahhh....  :)


TO: Old biddies

Oi, what the hell is a "DeelyBopper" (can't spell that, man!) ?  And are
they used for amusement ?  Eh?

I'm  tellin'  yer  mate,  you're  betting off doing zee Word in Blitz 2.
Then The Word might be able to match BlitzAMC is terms of sexyness.

AGA support, FULL TRACKER SUPPORT, OS friendly (depending on what you do
of  course) and tons loads more features.  Look at it for the long-term,
you  won't  have to do any recoding to speed it up (AMOS being slow, an'
all).  Also, you can have PROPER ERROR TRAPING!

Think about it, AMOS is a big wooden spoon (soz to anyone at AmosZine!),
and Blitz is a gold-plated fudge spoon.  See?  Thought you might.


TO: Dave Diamond/The Invaders
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

Dave, Dave, Dave. I'm gonna tell you summats about your articles.

Y'know  when  you write stuff like "My First Snog" ?  Yeh?  Well, you're
supposed  to  write about your first SNOG, not about when you got kissed
for 5 seconds when you were 6 !

Also,  "My  First  Pull".  Nope, it's like, only when you DO "pull", not
when you failed (probably).

That  "My  First  Homosexual  Encounter".  You saw a norty bit on a tape
which had some geezers in it.  "My First Homosexual Encounter" was a bit
of a mis-leading/strong, eh?  (Not that I'M a pufter, y'know)

See what I'm getting at?  Good.

Thanks  for  gimme'ing The Word #13.  Y'know that article of yours about
Roswell  ?   Well,  that phone in the background actually came out a few
years  after  1949.   Who do I know?  Easy, just look at the phone cord,
they wern't invented until sometime later.  `kay?


TO: Andy Bolt
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

Have  you  got  a  brother/relative  called  Martin  Bolt  that lives in
Plymouth?  Oh, just asking.
