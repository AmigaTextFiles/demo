<font color =#A0FF4C>                          Annoying shits
                          --------------
<font color =#A0FFFF>
I've  come  to  the  conclusion that a growing majority of the people in
this country are annoying,selfish,inconsiderate,oafish shits that should
be wiped off the face of the Earth.  Here's my top 10 hates:

1. Inconsiderate assholes who put their radios on full blast - Like we
   wanna hear their crap thumpa-thumpa-boom music.

2. Dog owners who let their animals crap all over the shop.  Parks
   couldnt be any more filthy if they were nuclear dumps - They should
   just be called "dog-toilets" and be done with it.

3. People who write into papers saying stuff like "Its not the kind of
   thing we want to see on OUR TV screens" as if they are the voice of
   the masses.

4. Dumb-asses with car alarms who cannot get it into their thick skulls
   that they have to disable the alarm before opening the doors. 

5. People who have loads of kids then dont take any responsibility for
   them. EG: Let then wander all over the place, shout and scream and
   generally piss you off, then blame everyone else if they come to
   harm.

6. Thick sheep who jam up the motorways each bank holiday - Oh, no-one
   else is going to think of that are they? Duh!

7. Prats who go through their lives never questioning the status quo,
   believing everything is Shangri-La and generally succumbing to the
   marriage, 2 kids, car, mortgage norm whilst looking down their noses
   at those who dont conform.

8. Football fanatics who make the game out to be a something more than
   22 sweaty blokes chasing a bag of wind around. These are the types
   who call people with constructive hobbies nerds, whilst splashing
   out on the latest footy strip and phoning radio shows with their
   tedious opinions. A matter of national pride? life and death? Yeah,
   right.

9. People who put the alarm on their house when they go out but dont
   leave a contact number with anyone. When it goes off on another
   false alarm (normally caused by a pet - "oh, we forgot") everyone
   except them has to suffer.

10. People that phone you up and when you answer say "Who's that?".
    Its like knocking on someones door and saying "Can I help you?"
    when they open it!
