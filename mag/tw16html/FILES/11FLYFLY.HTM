The following is 100% TRUE!

No  not  a plane, jet, helicopter, parachute, bungee jump...  I actually
flew!

YOU`RE ALL SAYING;

    That does it...he`s mad,absolutly bonkers!
    Yeah right,a bit too much valium there Dave!
    You`ve gone ga-ga my lad!

Well  even  though  you  may  think  that  I`m  totally crazy,I actually
believed  when  I was younger that I could fly and I think I really did.
I  dont  want  to  get  into  the full discussion of things but man (and
women)  CAN  fly  without  they  need  of  fuel.

I  was very young (about 9) and where I used to live the was a huge hill
and  when  I had finished playing with my mates (not like that you mucky
beggers) I used to run down this hill.

Maybe  it was just the sheer speed I was travelling at but it really did
feel  as  if I was flying,I thought this at the time and glanced down at
my feet... THEY WERE OFF THE GROUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<font color =#B8FF4C>
Only  about  10 inches or so though,but I really did think I was flying,
hey  I  probably  was, I tell you what though, it was an experience I`ll
never forget as that was just a superb feeling!

If you would like to donate money to keep up my therapy then please send
any cash or crisps to the usual address!

[Actually, I thought I could fly as well.  It was a long time ago, and I
though  I  could  fly down the stairs.  I nearly tried this once.  But I
didn't, as I'm not mental - BB/TrF]


<font color =#FFFF4C>[Most  people  thought  they could fly when they were younger, some even
experiencing  flying dreams that seemed so real.  As kids we would often
stand  on  top of the nearest hill on a windy day holding our coats open
behind  us  arms out-stretched waiting for the wind to pick us up.  Come
on you lot, own up to it!  Kei]
