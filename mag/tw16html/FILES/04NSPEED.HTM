Alrighty, so this article wasn't actually anything to do with banding
against slower-speed PC's, I only put that title in to annoy Phil!97,
who threatened to write an article entitled:  "Intel P133s are actually
better than AMD K6-200 cus Intel rock and my lobotomy hasnt affected me
one bit".
<P>
We'll await that one then.
<P>
But seriously, Intel CPU's have long been dominant on the PC market, and
it's only recently that their omnipotence has been shaken.  With the
arrival of the K6 MMX-compatible CPU from AMD, shockwaves have been sent
through the entire PC-retailing system.  For the first time ever you can
now buy a PC with decent all-round power that DOESN'T have an Intel CPU
at it's heart.
<P>
Alternative Pentium CPU's have been available for quite some time.  AMD,
Cyrix and IBM all released CPU's based on the Pentium technology but all
three lacked in the Floating Point department.
<P>
On paper the K6 is very impressive.  Aside from being 20-25% cheaper than
the equivalent MMX chip, it's also very compatible and pumps out slightly
more power as the following table indicates.

Although - as mentioned - on paper (or ASCII as the case may be) AMD's K6
puts out more power, on FPU code that is specifically compiled for the
Pentium CPU there is going to be roughly a 10% defecit.  Pentium-specific
titles include Quake and the popular rendering package, 3D Studio, for
example, in our own tests a complex 3D Studio scene, 10,000+ polygons in
800x600 true colour, took 34 seconds to render on a K6, but only 31 on a
Pentium 200mmx.
<P>
All is not lost, however.  Motherboards are improving all the time and
the latest TX boards support new bus speeds.  A bus speed is the speed
at which your motherboard runs as opposed to the speed of your CPU, so
while my CPU runs at 200Mhz, the board only runs at 66.
<P>
With these newer boards there are bus speeds of 75 and 83Mhz, with 100Mhz
in the pipeline (Tom at http://sysdoc.pair.com/ already has one to test,
everyone should visit this excellent site), and this means that you can
now reach speeds in excess of 200Mhz.
<P>
"And your point is...?"  I here you ask.
<P>
According to Uncle Tom, the K6 is immensely over-clockable. Certainly,
when I installed my chip, I was suprised that the machine was still able
to produce cool air even when temperatures were around 30C outside.  The
K6-200 should easily be able to handle speeds of 225 (3x75) and 233Mhz
(3.5x66 if your board supports 3.5), and even the rediculously speedy
250Mhz - 3x83Mhz bus speed.
<P>
The only downer with running the chips at this speed is that the RAM is
likely to fail under the strain if you're using EDO.  For higher speeds
it is recommended that you switch to 10ns DIMMS instead, most motherboards
support at least one - equivalent to 2 SIMMS - and newer boards have two
DIMM and 2 SIMM slots.  Many even allow you to mix the types, although
this would mean running your DIMMs at 60ns instead of 10 for compatibility
reasons.
<P>
DIMMs are also coming down in price, and there is little difference in
the cost between SIMMs and DIMMs is roughly 10%, and is dropping all the
time (as with most things on the PC) and will soon be reversed when
DIMMs become the standard.
<P>
No matter how much you protest it, CPU's are going to get faster and
faster and more people are going to get left behing the cutting edge of
technology, as is always the case.  With K6-200's at around 160 pounds
(CPU, Heatsink & Fan, inc VAT & Delivery) though, it's currently not
too expensive to get a top-notch processor, which will go a long way
to keeping you up to spec, especially if you can overclock it.
<P>
Is overclocking immoral?  Chip manufacturers would say so, but all they
want to do is sell you the biggest, fastest and most expensive chip they
can, so they're hardly likely to give you an honest opinion are they?
Personally I would like to quote Terry Pratchett:</FONT>

"Yes,sir.  I've given that viewpoint a lot of thought, sir,
and reached the following conclusion: arseholes to the lot
of 'em, sir."
</TD></TABLE></CENTER>
<P><FONT COLOR=#DCE7FF>
If your chip can run happily at these speeds then why the hell should
you settle for anything less?  The price difference between 166 and 200
CPU's is quite big, but it's nothing compared to the difference between
200 and 233.
<P>
So, what problems have I had with my K6-200 since I got it?  Er... well,
none actually!  True, I had to patch 3D Studio, but that applies to all
200Mhz machines, Pentium or otherwise.  Nothing is different except for
the fact that it's faster, so compatibility worry-warts can rest easy.
<P>
One thing you WILL have to consider is the fact that K6 does not mean
MMX as far as your motherboard is concerned.  Not all boards will be
able to handle the K6 CPU, so chances are that you'll have to buy a new
motherboard as well, especially if your machine is getting on a bit.
<P>
If your motherboard is MMX compatible then you are halfway there.  The
main thing to look for is Dual-Voltage compatibility, the K6 requires a
Core voltage of 2.8v and an I/O voltage of 3.35v, whereas normal Pentium
chips are 3.45v all the way through.  This is a power-saving measure
intended to reduce heat output and create chips that are more suitable
for use in laptops, but it also means that, if you fail to change it
and try to run the K6 at 3.45, then you're going to be left with a small
and very expensive square-shaped lump.
<P>
Just about all new motherboards support this though, if your board has
jumper settings for P55C (Pentium MMX) then you should be fine.
