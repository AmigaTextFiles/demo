Hokay,  this  is my first full PlayStation game, and guess what me ickle
luverlies?   I'm gonna review it (I got this game after playing the demo
version for a while)...

<font color =#FFD0F4>Upon  stuffing  it  (harumph!)  onto  the spindle and closing the lid, I
waited  for  it to load.  Well hit me in the pods with a house brick and
insert  a  Sooty  hand  puppet  into my rectum if the loading ain't dead
quick, like!

After  the  "Namco  Presents"  screen,  the  amazing (pretty much) intro
sequence  plays, wheEe!  It basically tells you the story of each of the
fighters (apart from Roger &amp; Alex).

<font color =#FFB8AC>
<font color =#FFD0F4>There's  quite a lot of things to try out.  Like:  Arcade Mode, Vs Mode,
Time  Attack, Survivial Mode, Team Battle and the highly useful Practice
Mode.
<font color =#FFC4B8>
Here's what they do ....
<font color =#FFD0F4>
    Arcade Mode: This is the main mode. You fight 7 characters then your
                 character's sub-boss, Kazuya and then the Boss (Devil).
                 You  get  to  see your character's ending (see later on
                 this) and then you get awarded the  corresponding  sub-
                 boss character to play.

<font color =#FFDCF4>
    Vs Mode    : You and another human player play each other. You both
                 have the option of increasing your energy by  40%,  so
                 the  match  lasts  longer  (the  developers   probably
                 implemented this mode as a sort  of  handicap,  but  I
                 just use it so the match lasts longer).   After  every
                 match, you both can select different characters.
<font color =#FFE8F4>
   Time Attack : Select a character and  fight  through  10  characters
                 (including your sub-boss and the 2 normal bosses).
                 You get timed. If  you  die  and  then  continue  (you
                 can't change characters), the timer will continue from
                 where you got slapped.  I've only played  this  option
                 twice. I took 4 mins 23 secs using (Marshall) Law.
<font color =#FFF4F4>
 Survival Mode : You select  a  character  (non-changeable during play)
                 and have to see how far you can get without losing yer
                 energy bar. You only get one bar of energy and it only
                 goes up a bit every fight (you start with a full one).
                 I think there's probably 24 matches to  complete.  But
                 the best I can do is 22 using Lee.
<font color =#FFFFF4>
   Team Battle : You and another human player (I'm not sure  about  the
                 computer) can select upto 8 characters each (the  same
                 character can only be select twice -  then  it'll  say
                 "Sold Out" if you try to select the character  again).
                 You both fighter each until someone wins.  The  energy
                 bar rules in the "Survial Mode" apply here.
<font color =#FFFFFF>
 Practice Mode : You select your character,  and then select the pooter
                 character.  The  computer  character just stands there
                 doing nothing. Kick the crap outt'a `im!  Press  Start
                 and there's LOADS of options! Check out the combo's,
                 moves  (although not all the moves are displayed,  see
                 a cheat guide or summats -  like  the  one  I'm  doing
                 for the PSX/Saturn/N64,   it's  called  Console  Cheat
                 Compendium - out soon!), replays and more! Brilliant!

<font color =#FFACAC>
<font color =#FFB8AC>
<font color =#FFD0F4>There  are  in  excess of 80 moves PER CHARACTER!  I'm still finding out
moves.   The  latest  one,  is  a  Paul Phoenix jobby.  When a character
charges  into you and is just able to punch the liquid out of your head,
keep  pressing  []  + /\ (square and triangle) at the same time.  You'll
grab  their  arm  and snap it.  Unfortuneatly, it hardly does any damge.
Nice red splat though.
<font color =#FFDCF4>
Each character has got to standard grab moves (by pressing either X + []
or () + /\), and some specialised moves.  King has got loads of grabbing
moves (he IS a wrestler after all).
<font color =#FFE8F4>
I  can  now  do the most complicated move in the game (I think).  It's a
move  by  King  that  kills the opponent after King's finished doing it!
Yeah!
<font color =#FFF4F4>
Here's what happens in steps ....
<font color =#FFFFF4>
    1. King grabs their leg, pushes them over and snaps it.
<font color =#FFE8F4>    2. He then puts one of their legs above the other one (while his
       is in there somewhere) and falls on it. Result? SNAP!
<font color =#FFDCF4>    3. The best bit!  By this time, the opponent is on his/her back,
       he shuffles their leg(s) about a bit, and stands on their
       calves (I think that's what they're called) and grabs their arms
       and pulls them over. So King is on his back and the opponent is
       facing directly upwards. Then guess what? He snaps both their
       arms and legs!  WhheeeEeeEeeeeEeEEEeeeee!

<font color =#FFA0AC>

<font color =#FFACAC>
<font color =#FFB8AC>
<font color =#FFD0F4>Well,  what  can I say about the gfx/sfx?  Amazing!  The breaking sounds
of the characters' bones will make some people cringe as will the actual
bone breaking visual action.
<font color =#FFDCF4>
Both characters are in a 3D landscape (there are no "out of bound" zones
like the Virtua Fighter games) and can move about in total 3D.  When the
characters  move  closer/further  away from each other, the camera zooms
accordingly.  The camera shifts about for the best overall view.
<font color =#FFE8F4>
All  the  action  moves  at 50fps and there's no slow-down what-so-ever.
Probably slightly better overall gfx than the arcade version.

<font color =#FFACAC>
<font color =#FFB8AC>
<font color =#FFD0F4>When  you  complete  the game with a character, you are treated to their
ending.   I  haven't played the PSX version of Tekken I, so I don't know
the  story  behind  it  all and stuff.  Some (quite a few infact) of the
endings  are  totally  pointless  and stupid.  Like, the one where Roger
(one  of  the  hidden  characters,  he's a kangeroo) is running with his
mates  through  the  "outback"  in  Austrailia and it's in time with the
music.   You've  got  to  see  it  to  believe how dodgy it is!  Totally
pointless!
<font color =#FFDCF4>
When  you  complete  it  with  a  character,  you  get the corresponding
sub-boss  character.   Say  for example, if you complete it with King (a
tiger type geeza), you'll get to select Armour King (ditto).  There's 10
standard  selectable  characters,  and  complete  it with them all, then
you'll  have  a  further  10  to select.  Then there's the Devil, Angel,
Roger,   Alex  and  Kazuya.   Hmmm...   25  characters  in  total.   The
characters  are  saved  to  the  memory  card, so you don't need to keep
completing the game with a character to get their sub-boss.
<font color =#FFE8F4>
I've  got  a  little gripe about SOME of the characters.  They blatantly
share  each  other's  moves (ie, Jack-2, Prototype Jack, Kuma and Ganryu
share pretty much the same moves).  Ahh well, only a little niggle.

<font color =#FFB8AC>
<font color =#FFD0F4>Has anyone noticed that when you've played over 40 matches using Law (me
mum's  fave  character - even though she isn't that great at the game!),
when you twat him, he flies miles into the air!  Dead funny!
<font color =#FFDCF4>
When  you  gained all the sub-bosses, hold down Select when picking your
character,  and  keep hold of it until the match starts.  Your character
will  be bigger.  Do this again during the Loading screen to get an even
bigger  character (yep, the female characters' bumps get bigger as well!
:·).
<font color =#FFE8F4>
When you've gained ALL the characters (including Roger &amp; Alex) then hold
L1  &amp;  R1  when  selecting  your  character.   You'll  get  a  Doom type
first-person  perspective  -  groOovy!   Play  against one of the female
characters - it's a great view!  :)
<font color =#FFF4F4>
You  know  when  you've got all the sub-bosses, because the title screen
changes to blue, and there's a face within the "Tekken II" text.
<font color =#FFF4FF>
There's  absolutely loads of features - you'll keep on finding new moves
for as long as the wanky Americans stereotype England (basically, a long
time!).

<font color =#FFD0F4>This  is an absolute nob-enlarger of a game!  I'm very impressed with it
(can't wait for Tekken III !).  Here's the scores ....
<font color =#F4C4C4>
    Presentation: 95%  - A brilliant rendered intro wiv ace music!
<font color =#E8D0C4>    Graphics    : 96%  - Very fluid and realistic, great!
<font color =#E8D0D0>    Sound       : 93%  - Loud bone-crunching, great voice effects!
<font color =#E8D0DC>    Playability : 97%  - As easy as a girl from Essex!  :)
<font color =#E8D0E8>    Lastability : 97%  - You'll keep finding new moves all the time!
<font color =#E8D0F4>
   OVERALL      : A beat `em up fan's dream come true! Even my sister
                  and mum likes it - so it can be that bad? Buy it or
                  forever fondle small hairless rodents!
