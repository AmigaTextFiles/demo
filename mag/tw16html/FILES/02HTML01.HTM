HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a form of scripting that's used
to create Internet Web Pages.  You do not need any special software to
create HTML, just a browser to be able to view it properly.  This is a
guide to help you get started, it will cover the basics of HTML and a
few of the more advanced features, and hopefully will help you create
your own pages quickly and easily.
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>How it Works</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
HTML files are read into the browser program, and built up rather like
structured drawing.  Granted there you don't get the vast range of
commands that are available in a Structured Drawing package, but then
you wouldn't normally type those in yourself.
<P>
HTML documents are ASCII files that are written in a certain way, a
file is processed based on what it contains, and this is done as a list
of TAGS.
<P>
There are two types of TAG: those which enclose and area; and those
that do not.  The start and end of a HTML document are defined using
the HTML and End-HTML Tags, the end tag is simply the start tag with
the "/" character in front of it, and all tags are surrounded with
angular ("&lt;" and "&gt;") brackets, or the "greater than" and "less than"
symbols.
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Getting started</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
Your first tag, then, is &lt;HTML&gt; and it's corresponding end tag of
&lt;/HTML&gt;, which will define your HTML document.  Create a new text file
and write them in as follows.
<P>
&lt;HTML&gt;<BR>
&lt;/HTML&gt;<BR>
<P>
Congratulations, you have just written a HTML document!  now that was
not so hard was it?  OK, so it doesn't actually DO anything, but it is
a HTML document, nonetheless.
<P>
Your HTML document will usually consist of two parts, a header and a
body text, not suprisingly these use the &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; tags, and
because something has to go between them they have corresponding end
tags.
<P>
A word here on enclosing tags.  It is always a good idea to ensure
you have closed your tag correctly before you actually put anything
in it, so that you don't forget.
<P>
In the above example we have closed the HTML tag already, and because
both the HEAD and the BODY are parts of the document, they need to go
inside the HTML tag, but they are not part of each other, so we end
up with:
<P>
&lt;HTML&gt;<BR>
 &lt;HEAD&gt;<BR>
 &lt;/HEAD&gt;<BR>
 &lt;BODY&gt;<BR>
 &lt;/BODY&gt;<BR>
&lt;/HTML&gt;<BR>
<P>
Note that it is perfectly valid to put all of the tags on the same line
of the document, it just isn't very readable!  For this reason we take
the programmers convention and indent related lines to the same degree,
thus &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;/HEAD&gt; are indented to the same amount because they
are related.  This has absolutely no effect on the output of the file,
you could write the above as...
<P>
<CENTER>&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;</CENTER>
<P>
...and it would do exactly the same thing, however it is generally only
advisable to put tags on the same line when there is very little between
them, just to keep things clear.
<P>
You do not need a HEAD area to create a working document, but it is the
part of the file that tells the browser and the user about it, so it's
not a bad idea to invest 30 seconds knocking one up!
<P>
The main thing you'll stick in here is the Title of the document, this
is a string of text that will be displayed at the top of your browser
and stored in your bookmark area whenever you create one.  As it is a
string, it has to be closed in an area and - you guessed it - it has
to have an end tag...
<P>
&lt;HTML&gt;<BR>
<P>
 &lt;HEAD&gt;<BR>
  &lt;TITLE&gt;My First HTML Document&lt;/TITLE&gt;<BR>
 &lt;/HEAD&gt;<BR>
<P>
 &lt;BODY&gt;<BR>
 &lt;/BODY&gt;<BR>
<P>
&lt;/HTML&gt;<BR>
<P>
...you'll notice that I have started to space things out a bit too, so
that you can see where the &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; areas start and end.  The
addition of lines for this purpose will also have no effect on your
document because seperate lines are not dispayed in this way, to get a
line of text one the screen, we have to put it in the main &lt;BODY&gt; of
our document.
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>The BODY area.</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
Anything you put in the BODY area - unless it is simply a remark for
yourself - will be displayed on the page when you view it in your web
browser.
<P>
The &lt;BODY&gt; tag itself also takes a few parameters if you want to use
them.  In all cases of enclosing tags, it is always the opening tag
that takes params, never the closing tag.
<P>
<CENTER>BGCOLOR="#rrggbb"</CENTER>
<P>
This is possibly the most popular param in the BODY tag, it simply sets
the background colour of the page to a 24-bit value that we are all
familiar with, so:
<P>
  <CENTER>&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"&gt;</CENTER>
<P>
will produce a document with a white background.  This is all very nice
unless your text colour is white too, in which case you can change it
using:
<P>
  <CENTER>TEXT="#rrggbb"</CENTER>
<P>
Which will set the colour of text (although not links) throughout the
document.  Some browsers, especially on the PC, allow you to substitute
words like BLACK, WHITE, GREEN etc for the RGB values in these two
commands, but as there will always be a browser somewhere that doesn't
permit this, it's a good idea to stick to numeric values.
<P>
  <CENTER>BACKGROUND="{filename}"</CENTER>
<P>
Allows you to specify an image file that will be used for the back-
ground of the displayed document, if it is too small to cover the 
entire page them it will be tesselated like wallpaper, so it's a
good idea to pick a textture that will wrap properly, and to refrain
from using logos that will tile when people use larger resolutions.
Replace {filename} with your file, eg:
<P>
 <CENTER>&lt;BODY BACKGROUND="water.gif"&gt;</CENTER>
<P>
You can combine parameters in any order, it makes no difference
whatsoever, and it means that:
<P>
  <CENTER>&lt;BODY TEXT="#ffffff" BACKGROUND="water.gif" BGCOLOR="#223344"&gt;</CENTER>
<P>
will do the same as:
<P>
  <CENTER>&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#223344" BACKGROUND="water.gif" TEXT="#ffffff"&gt;</CENTER>
<P>
To tell the truth, there is little point in setting a BGCOLOR and a
BACKGROUND, because the background image will overwrite the colour
anyway.  On some browsers, however, BGCOLOR also determines which
colour is used for transparent backgrounds, so it might be worth
keeping this in mind.
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Displaying Text.</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
So you've typed in all the text that you want to display in your new web
page, launched your browser and loaded it in, only to find that there's
one massive block of text on the screen.  Because of the differences
between machines, it is not enough to press your Return key to get the
text onto another line, a document that reads
<P>
 &lt;BODY&gt;<BR>
  This is line one<BR>
  This is line two<BR>
 &lt;/BODY&gt;<BR>
<P>
Will simply display
<P>
 This is line one This is line two
<P>
on the screen.  To seperate the two we have to use the first single tag,
the line break, or &lt;BR&gt;.  This is the same as forcing a return, but it
can be used anywhere in a document, even to seperate graphical images,
so the above BODY area should be re-written:
<P>
 &lt;BODY&gt;<BR>
  This is line one&lt;BR&gt;<BR>
  This is line two<BR>
 &lt;/BODY&gt;<BR>
<P>
Obviously the line break does not enclose an area, and as such does not
have a corresponding end tag, there is no such thing as &lt;/BR&gt; !
<P>
Similarly, you can define areas of text as Paragraphs by inserting a
Paragraph break, or &lt;P&gt;.  Because these are meant to represent blocks
of text, it's generally more readable to put them between the blocks,
though obviously it makes no difference, it's simply more readable.
<P>
Replacing &lt;BR&gt; with &lt;P&gt; in the above example produces much the same but
with one small difference:  There is now a blank line between the two
lines of text, because the second line is defined as a new paragraph.
Additionally, I would put the &lt;P&gt; on it's own line between the two.
I have seen the &lt;/P&gt; tag in use as well, to define the end of a para-
graph, but personally I have never used it.
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Different styles</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
OK, so you've got your big blocks of text on the screen and you've read
through them and decided that there are some words that you want to
underline, some that you want bold, and some that you want to appear in
stonking great text instead of that same size all the time.
<P>
To change the style of an area you can use:
<P>
   &lt;B&gt; ... &lt;/B&gt; to emBOLDen an area,<BR>
   &lt;I&gt; ... &lt;/I&gt; to put it into ITALICS, or<BR>
   &lt;U&gt; ... &lt;/U&gt; to UNDERLINE it.<BR>
<P>
These have end tags, that means they apply to the area between them.
Simply choose the area you want to change and insert the relevent tags.
<P>
Note that none of the above three tags are affected by the &lt;BR&gt; or &lt;P&gt;
methods of seperating, if your text goes over one of these it won't be
switched off half way through, handy sometimes, worth remembering on
other occasions.
<P>
You can also make an area a different size of text.  By default the
font size used (not the same as the size defined in the actual font
files by any means) is 3, but it can range from 1 up to 7, allowing
you to use different sizes wherever you want them.
<P>
Again, this tag controls an area, and it's quite simply:
<P>
  &lt;FONT&gt; ... &lt;/FONT&gt;
<P>
&lt;FONT&gt; takes several parameters as well, like &lt;BODY&gt;, these are:
<P>
   SIZE={0-7}
<P>
In Amiga browsers these are defined in the setting somewhere unless
proper true-type fonts are used, on the PC they are all automatic.
<P>
   FACE="{fontname}[,{fontname}][,{fontname}]"
<P>
The FACE parameter of the &lt;FONT&gt; tag lets you make three attempts at
finding a font on the host machine, if the first is not found then it
looks for the second, if the second is not found then it looks for the
third.
<P>
   COLOR="#rrggbb"
<P>
The text colour can be changed from the default by using this parameter
to set a temporary rendering colour, again it is in the standard RGB
format, and again, some browsers recognise keywords like BLACK, WHITE,
YELLOW etc.<P>
