<font color =#FFFFFF>
Okay Word staff geezers, here some stuff for y'all ....
<font color =#FFB8E8>
  · Like, where's the multi-tasking, man? Oh, if you don't want
    the new users to know that its been  coded  in  AMOS,  then
    change the LAMIGA+A to LAMIGA+M in the AMOS prefs thing.
<font color =#FFDCE8>
  · Eugh! What's happened to the colours?! Why are they soooooo
    dark!? Go to the adult section in issue #15 and look at the
    face. Looks weird, eh? Press F1 to go to white and the face
    will look far better - and  it  looks  EXACTLY  like  Gilly
    Anderson! Phweeee! (as D!ck would say)

<font color =#FFFF4C>[I did that for a reason!  Er..  I forget what it was..  It was GA but I
only  wanted the eyes as the previous header was crap in my opinion. Why
not  do some  yourself matey, send them in and tell me the RGB value you
want me to show it in.  Kei]

<font color =#FFF4E8>
  · Articles?  They  seemed to have dwindled down like mad.  Or
    are you saving some for the following issue(s) ?

<font color =#FFFF4C>[Nah  just  low  on contribs although issue 15 had larger articles in as
the  disks  were  pretty  packed.  We need more readers to contribute as
well  as our regular contributors.  Come on, you lot out there must have
something to say?  Kei]

<font color =#FFF4C4>
  · Colour!  Increase the main text display area to 16  colours
    (or 8, as it looks like you're using Dual-Playfields).  The
    diskmag  I'm  currently  coding  looks  brilliant  with  16
    colours (it also supports 256 colours) !
<font color =#FFD0C4>
  · Bug/Glitch.   The  tix  aren't  saved  properly.  When  yer
    load the mag again,  only  a  few of the articles have  the
    tix next to them. Tut tut. Who needs a good slapping, eh?

<font color =#FFFF4C>[I  noticed that if you do not exit properly it does not work.  But like
the  other  technical  questions you are asking here, I'll leave that to
Amida to answer once he gets settled into his new place.  Kei]

<font color =#FFD0A0>
  · TWAT. Implement more features into it for gord's sake!
    Dunno what really, ummm... `fink about it.
<font color =#FFFF88>
  · Cheese. Where is the stuff ?

<font color =#4C4C4C>
Look!   See!   Look  at MY sexy colours above!  THAT'S how you should be
doing it, like!  Not that dead-dark damp stuff!
<font color =#FFFFFF>
There.   That's  all  I can think of at the minute, so get your nobs out
and start fondling away me disk-based friends!
<font color =#E8F4FF>
*UPDATE* Use The Word Colour Inserter (TWCI) which I coded this
         afternoon. It's pure, raw, hard sex in an executable!

<font color =#FFFF4C>
[I  like'd  the dead dark damp stuff as you referred to it since I spent
time  doing  it last issue since only 2% of contributors bothered to put
colour  codes  in  at all.  It's a right pain in the butt doing it I can
tell ya.  Kei]
