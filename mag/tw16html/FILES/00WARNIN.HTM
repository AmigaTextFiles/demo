This  disk  magazine  is created by drunk guys with nothing better to do
than  to  use  up  their  parents  electricity in order to watch endless
demos, play music modules and occasionally type articles.

A particular article may of seemed funny to us the night before while we
were pissed on treacle vodka (ask Ruiner) and suffering from an overdose
of  "Who  can  play the best module the loudest".  Upon waking up in the
land  of  "ohhh  my  god  did I eat that?...." we would like to think we
covered  our butts with a standard "Word Of Warning" to those of you who
loaded  up  this  diskmag with the impression it was written by the guys
you want your daughter to marry when she grows up.

Therefore it falls down to me, the editor to ensure that the readers of
this e-Zine realise that this magazine is created by the people for the
people and the people are generally typing stuff they didn't learn from
their parents... "well he was a good boy and kept to himself..."

So  now  with this knowledge firmly planted in your cerebral cortex..  I
hope you enjoy reading The WORD..

  ..oh yeah.. I nearly forgot. I'm moving to Tibet tomorrow so I'll be
away if you wish to sue me. 8)
