Atlanta  georgia was the setting for the 26th olympic games, celebrating
100  years  of  competition and defending your countries championship to
the  countries across the world.  I`m not one for sport but as soon as I
witnessed  what  was  the best opening of a event I have ever seen I was
hooked.  The opening celebration was superb with fireworks, groovy aztex
music  and  costumes  and  some  of  the most lavish special effects and
acrobatic  manouvers  I have ever seen.  This went on for around 3 hours
and  every  bit  of  it  was  superb, why in all the amazing going ons I
didn`t  even  notice  president  bill  clinton trip over some cables and
frankly  who  cares?   The  u.s.a air force flew over a few of it`s jets
just when the american national anthem was finished...great timing guys!

I  didn`t watch ALL the games as I wouldn`t be writing this now...i`d be
in  hospital  after repetitive eye strain but i`m glad I watched the bit
of olympic history that I did.

The  weightlifting  was  truely  one  of  the  most intense games I have
witnessed,  the sheer will power to go on and try your best was never in
doubt and all competitors did more than their best to be the champion.

It was the womens gymnastics that I watched the most as they were great!
The  speed  at  which  these girls go would surely have broken the sound
barrier  and  the  moves  which were awesome brought delight to my eyes.
Some  of  the  russian  girls messed up by falling on their ass, now i`m
sure there could have been something wrong with the mat as it happened 3
times???

These  girls  I  have to mention were GEORGEOUS!!!!  phoooooor!!  lovely
girls, and not slappers either just "nice `n` pleasant" looking.

Then  the  joy  was  spoilt  with a bomb exploding in the near centinial
games  park, built especially for the peace of all countries through-out
the world.

There  is  always  one person who has to spoil things for others, and in
this  case killed 2 people.  If I caught the person then I would tie him
up  on  a  large  pole in the middle of the olympic grounds and tell the
people that they can ALL come and spit &amp; throw food etc at this trash.

It  comes  to  something  when  an event like this which was invented to
bring  every  athlete in the world to come and join in friendly sporting
competition  and  to be united as one, and then the peace is broken with
this attrotious occurance.

The  olympic  games  held  SO  much emotion and dedication that you just
couldn`t  get  away  from watching just a few minutes of it.  The ending
ceremony  was  good  but not as good as the opening and I felt that they
went  on  for  too  long  so  people  would  get  bored  with it but the
celebrations  went  onto  the grounds with fans dancing and partying all
night long.

Cacius  clay  (muhamed  ali) once threw away his gold medal after people
thought  it  was given to him because of racial equal rights.  This time
cacius  who now suffers terribly from parkinsons disease was given a new
gold medal....he desserved it.

The  commentator of the games (u.k version) was terrible with his quirky
voice,  maybe  he had a throat disease but I wouldn`t have put him on as
it  was  annoying  and you couldn`t make out what he was saying half the
time.

Still,  america  won  once  again  with about 43 gold medals comapred to
britains  1......WAIT!!  they have now took the gold medal from whomever
won it!!!!


U.S.A,  U.S.A,  U.S.A!

Britains  athletes had to sell their clothes at skid row (no kidding) to
get the air fare home!

In france they have 100 trainers for each event.....britain has 1.

More  money  is  needed  to  finance these british athletes and to build
suitable grounds for training etc but will it ever happen?

I`ll  look  forward to the games in sydney australia in the year 2000, i
doubt  if  the  aussies will put on a better show than the americans but
the games itself will still be worth looking forward to!


See you there!?
