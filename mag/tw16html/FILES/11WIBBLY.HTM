Thought I'd take it upon myself to answer some of the stuff said by that
'person' Bootblock/Terraform:  So here we go...

Hey  you're  telling  me  you wouldn't be worried if a nuclear explosion
happened  and killed every one?  Wow, you're a brave guy!  Have to agree
those,  those  two  on  afternoon  Lunch  were funny.  But don't put the
impression  of  females  down  any more than males, there are males like
that as well, people are people regardless of gender ok?...

I'm  lucky,  my  neighbours  are  really  nice, which is one of the best
things  about  our  street,  we have an agreement that we all look after
each other's places when we go away on holiday.  I know some people have
to put up with complete tossers for neighbours, never had to myself, but
I  guess  it's tough.  But kids are a bit of a pain at times, but if the
kids  next door want to play basket ball on the drive, i'll go out there
and  move  the car for them (we share a drive ya see).  So my neighbours
are nice.

VERY  annoying  when  little kids just stare, dunno why they do it, they
must  know  it's the most intimidating thing of Earth, but the thing is,
we're  getting  intimidated by 4 year olds!  The world's gone mad.  Your
method  of  running  toward  it  at 398mph (very precise mesurement) and
screaming:   "AAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!" would work probably...
I've yet to try it.

Give it a chance, it hasn't been on the air long, apparently it's better
than  C4  was  when  that  started....  and what's wrong with Americans?
Some  of  my  best ever friends are Americans, they're wonderful people,
yeah  you get the tossers, like anywhere, but it's racist to say they're
all  like that, and I bet you've never been either...  or have ya?  I've
been 3 times, nice place.  Due back at Xmas, I'll tell them how much you
love them :)

Sorry  to  hear  you're dissapointed with this, I helped get the station
off  the  ground (with recording the news and traffic jingles and music,
and  some of the 'slots' oo-err :) And I've covered two shows earlier in
the Spring, it's a cool station, but if you're not into house and dance,
I  guess you don't like it.  Hey they play "Funy Green Dogs" and "Double
99" they're cool in my books.

So any feedback?
