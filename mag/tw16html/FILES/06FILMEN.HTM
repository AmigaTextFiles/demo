He's  back, and he's gonna spoil yer phun!  Reet then, I'm in a bit of a
mardy  mood,  so I'm gonna spoil the endings to some films.  Don't mind,
do you?  Yes?  Well shuv it!

<font color =#FFE84C>
                              DRAGONHEART
<font color =#FFE8D0>
The  dragon  (Draco)  dies at the end (he makes the bloke kill him so he
(Draco)  can  "be  free")  and joins the other dragons in the "heavens".

<font color =#FFE84C>
                             MORTAL KOMBAT
<font color =#FFE8D0>

Sonya  kills  Kano by doing a Scissor Grab (I think) on him and snapping
his  neck.   Johnny (that looks spelt wrong) Cage kills Goro by knocking
him  off the cliff.  Cage also kills Scorpion by slicing his head (well,
skull)  in  bits and then it explodes.  Lui Kang kills SubZero (noooo!).
Kitana  helps Sonya, Johnny and Lui (Raiden* is also on their side) Kang
to  get  to  the  final boss - Shang Tsung (silent `T').  Lui Kang kills
Shang by punching him onto some spikes and is then gets to wibble to his
brother (forgot his name) to "bury the hatchet".

Right at the end, Shao Khan appears and it the size of a sky-scraper and
looks  pissed  off  at  the  "gang".  Raiden says "I don't think so" and
everyone  gets into a I'm-gonna-kick-your-head-in type of stance.  So, a
cheesey/bullshite ending methinks.

*I  don't  care  if  Raiden  is spelt as "Rayden".  As it was originally
spelt  "Raiden"  when  the  first Mortal Kombat came out.  God knows why
Midway then changed it to Rayden, as it looks weedier that way.

<font color =#FFE84C>
                                PHENOMON
<font color =#FFE8D0>
A  light  hits John Travolta and it in turn makes him basically, brainy.
He  doesn't need to sleep, he can learn a language in 45-odd minutes and
stuff.   At  the  end he doesn't want his "powers" anymore, and then the
"powers" buggers off.

<font color =#FFE84C>
                             BATMAN FOREVER
<font color =#FFE8D0>
Batman  &amp;  Robin  kills  The Riddler and Two-Face while in The Riddler's
tower  place.  Nicole Kidman obviously gets saved by Batters', while the
whole  tower  place  caves in.  The Riddler gets thrusted into an aslyum
for  spaz-type  peeps.  The Riddler thinks he himself is Batman (because
the  thing that he used to gain knowledge from peoples' tellies, sort of
overloaded which shafted his head-up).

<font color =#FFE84C>
                               WATERWORLD
<font color =#FFE8D0>
Kevin  Costner  (and  that woman and the little girl with the map on her
back)  wipe  out  all  the Smokers and then find Dry Land.  Oh, with the
help  of  that old (dodgy) man living with the two girls).  The original
dry  land  is  totally covered in water.  Apparently, mud (or "dirt") is
currency.  Kevin is also a mutant - a geeza with gills.

<font color =#FFE84C>
                            DUMB AND DUMBER
<font color =#FFE8D0>
It turns out there's shitloads of wonga in the briefcase, they spend all
of  it and put IOU's in the case.  They find Mary, the "close friend" of
Mary's  family  is  the baddie and tries to kill them at the end.  Harry
doesn't  die  as  he's wearing a bullet-proof vest.  The piss gets taken
out of the English - albeit in a nice way.  Probably.

<font color =#FFE84C>
                               NO ESCAPE
<font color =#FFE8D0>
Ray helps the peasants kill the enemy.  Then Ray, and a couple of others
escape (hmmm, defeats the purpose of "No Escape", then?).  Thank God the
English people aren't stereotyped!  The fat bloater (the boss dood) also
gets  stranded on the island - and probably killed.  The fat English man
turns  out  to  be  a  spy/whatever  for  the  fat  boss - and also gets
stranded.

                     X-FILES: File 8 - Tempus Fugit
<font color =#FFE8D0>
That  man  on  the plane dies (he was carrying a UFO power-source).  The
reason  for  the  crash?   A U.S.  goverment fighter plane (or whatever)
tries to shoot down the plane (coz of the UFO power source - the man was
gonna  reveal  it to the world.  I think) but un-expectedly twats into a
UFO  that's  "freezing time", trying to get that bloke also (not for bad
reasons).   It'll  take ages to spoil the story, so you'll have to watch
it.   Sorry!   Oh,  Gillian  Anderson  is  looking very sexy - as always
(she's still got dodgy lips!  - I'm talking about he MOUTH lips here!) !

I got the vid on the day it was released - 27/06/1997.

                            INDEPENDENCE DAY
<font color =#FFE8D0>
The    Americans    (oh,    WHAT    A    SUPRISE)   kill   the   aliens.
Blah-de-bloody-blah.

<font color =#FFE84C>
                              ROBOCOP III
<font color =#FFE8D0>
That  English  bloke  boss  turns out to be the crime boss (oh look, the
Americans  are  still making English people the baddies.  How thoughtful
of  the talentless wankers) and kills Lewis.  Er...  can't remember what
else happens.

<font color =#FFE84C>
                                WEDLOCK
<font color =#FFE8D0>
The girly turns out to be working for the prison place.  But she ends up
being  on  Rutger's  side,  and they both live happily ever after - with
loads of money.

<font color =#FFE84C>
                              SPLIT SECOND
<font color =#FFE8D0>
English people are stereotyped with stupid f'kin posh accents.  Oh, they
(the  stereotyped  English  peeps) also say "Trashbin" instead of saying
"bin".   Ah,  those  cheeky  young Americans!  So God damn stupid.  They
think  they're  the  only  people  on  the  Earth.   Oh, anyway...  that
stereotyped  English  bloke  gets  shot, but he's wearing a bullet-proof
vest.   Hmm.   The  "Ripper"  turns out to be some kind of alien thing -
anyway, it dies by getting electrocuted, fried and blown to smeg.  Oh, I
don't  like  Americans that stereotype.  AND, that leather-faced tosspot
Pete  Postle-thwaite  (whatever)  is  in  it.   Adding  even more to the
English stereotype.  Thanks Pete, you wankstain!

<font color =#FFE84C>
                               LEVIATHAN
<font color =#FFE8D0>
The  sexy "red haired" woman dies.  Sixpack does as well (whee!).  Er...
only  three  people survive.  That sexy (but f'kin English stereotyped -
thanks  again  you  Americans  - I love you lot, I do) woman, that mista
that  played RoboCop, and that black bloke.  Oh, the alien get it's head
blown to bits with some kind of canister thingy.

<font color =#FFE84C>
                             BODY SNATCHERS
<font color =#FFE8D0>                             (1993 Version)

That  older  girl and that man she meets survive and fly about trying to
kill the aliens.  That hippy bitch is also an alien.  Oh, you get a nice
view  of  Ms Tilly's fanny (and that girl's titties).  Dunno if a double
is used though.  Pah.

<font color =#FF88FF>
Oh well, that's all I can be bothered to type right now. See yers!
