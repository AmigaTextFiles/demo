<font color =#DCFFFF>                            By Dave Diamond

To answer a few of kei`s remarks over the last few issues....

I was unable to answer my email as the college computers are now offline
for a few months.

Whenever  I  refer  to  Freak or Iceman,the ones where Freak appear were
written  before  he left and Iceman was included as you said he would be
the next editor.

<font color =#FFFF4C>[Iceman?   Can't  remember saying that but maybe I wanted him to come in
as  a  technical editor.  However he's so addicted to IRC that we hardly
hear  from  him  these days.  I think he wants to take over the diskback
service from me so maybe he will come onto the Words staff full time but
I'm  not  yet  sure at the time of writing this.  There are a few places
open on the Word staff we'd like filling if anyone is interested?  These
are:   SCENE  CORRESPONDANT  (one  for  the Amiga and another for the PC
scenes), WORLD NEWS EDITOR and DISTRIBUTOR(s).  Kei]

As  for  me  saying  that  I  love  writing  articles  and then none are
submitted  for  future  issues,The  Word used to appear whenever it felt
like  it.   If you supply me with a deadline then I`ll follow it.  I get
the  latest issue of your magazine some weeks after it`s released so the
only  way to get my articles in time is to contact me by mail say a week
before the deadline,and I`ll send them off to you promptly.

<font color =#FFFF4C>[The  deadlines  are usually a week before the end of a month.  The Word
is  then  released  at  the  end of the month.  The current deadline for
articles  for  this  issue was 22/08/97 with a release date of 30/08/97.
You  can  check the loading ascii to see whether I made it or not.  Next
issues deadline will be around the 22/09/97 for contributions.  Kei]

Melissa  Joan  Hart  was 14/15 when she was in the Nickelodeon kids show
"Clarissa  Explains It All" she is now 21 and VERY beautifull I may add.
Not  that  she  wasn`t  beautifull  when she was 14.  Dont worry Kei and
other  Word  fans  -  Dave  Diamond isn`t into the "younger girls" - you
would  know  about  this  if Kei printed the "Child Sex" article I wrote
some months ago.  I haven`t seen it yet (although I missed issue 14).

<font color =#FFFF4C>[I know MJH is cute. And yes I deleted that article.  Kei]

Do  I  get  the  feeling that I`m not wanted in The Word?  It seems that
nearly  every  article  I  have  submitted has some sort of "sarchastic"
remark at the end.  Whether this is just for fun I dont know,but there`s
no point in me continuing writing if no-one respects my views now is it?
I  enjoy reading articles for the simple reason that they are being read
my  apreciative  minds  and  when  those minds aren`t there anymore then
perhaps it`s time to move on??

<font color =#FFFF4C>[I do tend to over-comment and I'm on a comment diet at present although
this  article  shows me on a binge.  There have been mixed views on your
articles  feedback  wise so it's up to you what you want to do and where
you wish to go.  Not me.  Kei]

Some  of  my  adult  articles being banned?  Why?  If there are any that
have  been  banned (I haven`t seen the May story yet) then why?  They`re
in the adult section and you should be mature enough if you want to read
them.  What`s the point in having an adult section if all the more shall
we say `hardcore` articles are left out?

<font color =#FFFF4C>[The  adult  section is there for adults true.  But there is a different
between  legal  adult material for consenting adults and all out illegal
pornography.   The stuff of yours I do not print is the paedophillic and
animal  stuff  among  others.   I do not want to be prosecuted so do not
send  any  more  articles in that will get me or any other member of The
Word  staff  into  trouble.   There are other mags that print that stuff
which will gladly take those articles.  Kei]

People  wont read an article if the review is crap - of course they will
- to see why the writer thinks it`s crap and the reasons etc.  It`s also
an  opportunity  for  the  person who LIKES that particular programme to
write in with THEIR views.

Finally  the  remark  about  nearly  all  of  my  "stories" sounding the
same...if  you dont like them then dont bother reading them - just print
them.   I  like them and I know many other people think they`re funny,we
haven`t  got  all the same tastes you know - I hate the hardware section
but you dont see me complaining do you?

<font color =#FFFF4C>[You just did!  I've had mixed reviews about your articles in the recent
past  and  there have been some replies by people in the last few issues
so  read  them  to find out what YOUR readers think about your articles.
You  can  write what you want but as the editor I decide if they are too
offensive  to print or not.  Do you know I've written a script macro for
cygnus editor to edit your articles?  Here's what it does:

After  the  first  line  of each paragraph it deletes the first space on
every line so the paragraphs can be properly Word formatted.

Replaces "," with ", "

Replaces " i " with " I "

Removes  any  text  between "DAVE" and "DIAMOND" in headers as they just
get long and silly and no one else does them.

I  am  not  being  picky  Dave, as I'm not botherd about having to use a
macro  to  edit your articles.  However I know that instead of doing 200
slim,  fast articles like you sent me recently, there are probably a few
good  articles  in you that will suprise and blow the socks off the Word
readers out there.  Show them what you can really type when you set your
mind to it!
