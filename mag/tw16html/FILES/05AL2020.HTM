<font color =#B8FFFF>        2020 Technology - The pessimistic alternative by Phil97
        -------------------------------------------------------
<font color =#E8FF4C>
If  my  other "Future" artical was too bright and fluffy for you, here's
the depressing alternative:  Razor blades at the ready?


Televisions
-----------

No  one has managed to invent an affordable flatscreen TV so we're still
stuck  with  massive  cathode-ray-tube wide (and deep!) screen TVs.  The
BBC  is  still charging a "licence fee" (of o1000) even though there are
9999 alternative free channels and nobody watches it..

Video Recorders
---------------

VHS is still going strong.  Fearing another VHS/BETA war, no one company
will take the plunge and develop a modern alternative.

Computers
---------

The  PC  still  exists  in  its dedicated system/monitor/keyboard style.
Windows '20 requires 256MB just to run and still crashes.  Live video is
still  crap,  Voice  recognition software is still crap.  Consoles still
run better games.

Internet
--------

The  internet becomes gridlocked with the sheer number of people on line
(even  with optical links).  Licences are required to log in and logging
of  all  site  accesses  are made by ISPs in order to build "personality
sales profiles".

Crime
-----

TV  cameras  are  on  every  lamp post, and no one seems to mind.  Crime
rates still increase.  Every baby born has its DNA sampled and stored in
the  police's  criminal  data base.  Everyone must carry ID cards and be
ready to display them on demand.

Cars
----

Fuel costs are sky high but the roads are still crammed with cars driven
by people willing to pay anything for their slice of "personal freedom".
Electric  cars  have  been  snubbed  because  of the speed/range limits.
Hydrogen cars have been judged as too dangerous and banned.

Power Generation
----------------

Fusion  power  is  still  30 years away.  Old nuclear power stations are
being  kept  running..   Nobody  knows  what  to do with all the waste..
Power bills go through the roof.

Medicine
--------

Due  to  the  mapping of the whole of human DNA, insurance companies can
refuse  to cover people they know to be at risk from hereditry diseases.
Shady quacks accept orders for designer babies from the rich.  The truth
about  the BSE scandle finally becomes apparent when thousands of people
over 40 begin showing signs of premiture senility.

Environment
-----------

The  Earth  becomes  a  stinking cess-pool.  The population explosion is
left  unchecked,  natural  resources dry up, radioactive waste is strewn
across  the  globe,  dangerous  middle-eastern  dictators  have  nuclear
weapons and new viruses and superbugs threaten the masses..

See ya there!
