We  all  love  a  game  at  the  arcade  dont  we?   My personal fave is
wrestlefest, but if the game is successfull they will usually convert it
to  consoles and then finally the home computer.  But are they any good?
Lets have a look at some of them...

Mortal  kombat  1  and  2...apart  from  the `silky` colors and parallax
scrolling they remain very good conversions, but if you look at the snes
versions  then  you`ll see that the`re much better, but the snes is a 16
bit  machine  and  so  is  the  amiga  so why cant we have the `perfect`
conversion?   Many  companies  will probably say that they could make it
perfect  but  it  would  be  on a couple more disks which would increase
spending.

Streetfighter 2...oh dear, a perfect example really (the snes was fine),
this  was  easily a rush job and could have been done better, I mean its
just not acceptable now is it?  Im not a coder or programmer but im sure
given  the  time  you  could easily get the parallax (shadow fighter has
it),  the  speed  (aga machine anyone) and just cut down the colors, but
make  them  attractive,  I  say  if  they  did this then they could most
probably fit it on 6 disks.

Super  streetfighter  2...i  haven`t played all of this but the graphics
again  say  it  all,  they could have done much better (this was the aga
version), some nice bits in there but the screen size let it down badly.

Overall  there is big a misdirection in making conversions, I think they
say `well the gameplay is good so we`ll cut on the gfx`.  Get a life, if
they  made a perfect version of sf2 then everyone would buy it, make the
snes  owners  cringe  for  a change.There are loads of arcade games that
haven`t  been  converted  which  is  a shame, these include wrestlefest,
spiderman and the x men, captain silver and crude busters-data east made
half  of  these  games and converted midnight resistance and robocop but
why not the others?  Go on guys you can do it!
