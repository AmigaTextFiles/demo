PART THREE

                             At The Bolshoi

The  third  character  is Donna Fatale, the star of the Russian Bolshoi.
After  her  performance she will be back at her dressing room when there
is  a  knock  at the door.  In comes a man who introduces himself as RJ,
the  richest  landowner  in Georgia.  He will then tell Donna that he is
passing  through as he is travelling to Venice on the Orient Express but
he  simply  had  to  see  the  performance.   RJ  will then ask Donna to
accompany him to Venice and she will accept.

                     Journey On The Orient Express

Donna and RJ arrive at the station with a large box described by RJ as a
souvenir from the Kremlin he paid a mere one million Rouble dollars for.
Now, our three heroes, Doug, Dino and Donna, are all on board the Orient
Express.

RJ and Donna are in a huge compartment with a large four-poster bed, but
let  Donna  leave the room and head for the bar.  When you arrive at the
bar,  go  up  to  Alex  and  Kos and talk to them.  Alex and Kos are old
friends  of  Donna  who,  before she became famous, had starred in a few
risque  films  for  the boys in the past.  The boys proceed to blackmail
poor  Donna  unless  she  does a spot of acting for them in their latest
venture  to steal the plans for a new microprocessor.  The woman who has
the  plans  is  none  other  than  Miss Molatova, who is currently being
protected by Dino.

Donna  agrees  to get the microfilm containing the plans in exchange for
the  strange  but  arty pictures of herself that the boys just happen to
have.   Now leave the bar and head for room number 3, Doug's room.  Doug
and  Donna have also met before and Donna enlists Doug's help to get the
microfilm  and, for his help, Doug will collect a smacking big kiss from
the busty Donna!

You  now  take  control of Doug, so go to room 10, knock on the door and
find  that  Doug  knows Dino from a past experience too!  Doug will then
find out that Dino is with Miss Molatova and, knowing how thick Dino is,
Doug  tells  him that he needs his help to organise a surprise party for
Miss  Molatova.  Doug will then go on to tell Dino that he needs a photo
of  Miss Molatova for the present so there must be an old negative lying
around somewhere in the compartment.

Now  take  control of Dino and go in search of the microfilm after going
to  the  bar  and buying a cup of coffee for Miss Molatova.  When inside
the  cabin, start to talk to Miss Molatova.  She will ask for her coffee
and Dino will give it to her, all over her coat!  The fool has spilt the
coffee  all  over  her.  When she goes into the bathroom, leave the room
and  instantly  walk  back in.  Now is your chance to find the microfilm
as, by now, Miss Molatova will have finished in the bathroom and gone to
the bar.

Enter  the bathroom, pick up the ring and now go to the bedroom and pick
up the bottle.  Give these two items to Doug who is waiting outside and,
as  Doug,  return  to your own room to meet Donna, giving her the items.
Now,  as Donna, take a close look at the ring and find the microfilm and
then  examine  the bottle to find it contains sleeping pills.  Now leave
the  room  and  go  to  the bar to give the microfilm to Alex and Kos in
return  for  the naughty pictures and the negatives.  Now go back to see
Doug.

Now take control of Doug and go to the bar.  When you get there, look at
the  man  at  the  bar and recognise him as the thief who took the crown
from  under  your  nose in Part One!  Go back and see Donna and tell her
about it.  Donna agrees to try and sweet talk the thief into letting her
into  his room so that she can search for the missing crown.  Take Donna
to  the  bar  and  talk  to the thief, letting Donna's natural aura take
control  of  the  situation.   The thief is gagging for it!!  Donna will
convince the thief, after hours of hard negotiation, to take her back to
his  compartment  to  look at his etchings.  Once Donna gets back to the
room,  put  the  sleeping pills in the champagne and the thief will soon
fall fast asleep.

Once  the thief is out of it, open the wardrobe and examine the shirt to
find  the number 653 written in the shirt cuff.  Now pick up the blanket
and  go  back  to  tell  Doug  what  you found and give him the blanket.
Revert  back  to  Doug  and  go down the corridor and talk to the ticket
inspector, who will ask for a cigarette.  Go to the bar and ask Alex and
Kos  for  a  cigarete.   They  will tell you that they have some special
cigars  for  sale  at 100 Rouble dollars each.  Now go back to see Donna
and  ask  her if she has 100 Rouble dollars.  She will tell you that she
will  ask RJ for it.  Revert to Donna and go to your compartment, number
6.  Donna will actually ask RJ for 10,000 Rouble dollars, which she will
get.  Now direct her back to Doug's room.

Take  charge  of  Doug again and go back to the bar to purchase a cigar.
Now  take  this to the ticket inspector and he will ask you for a light.
Doug  will now have to go all the way back to the bar to get a light off
the soccer fan, sitting beyond Alex and Kos at the back of the carriage.
Now  go  back  through  the  train to the ticket inspector and light his
cigarette.   He  will get really stoned, so take the opportunity to pick
up his keys.

Once you have the keys, make your way back to the bar and go through the
back  door  of  the train, past the soccer fan, and climb onto the train
roof.   Walk  right along the storage car and select the sheet.  You can
now let yourself down on the sheet.  When you are holding it, select the
keys and let yourself in.  Once inside, select the 'OPEN' icon and click
on the trunk.  You can now use the set of numbers that Donna found (653)
as a combination to open the trunk and grab the crown!
