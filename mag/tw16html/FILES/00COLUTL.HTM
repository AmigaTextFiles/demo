That's it, NO MORE (probably) !  Inserting colour codes into my articles
is  taking almost as long as typing them!  So, I'm gonna do summat about
it.
<font color =#F4FFFF>
I  haven't  started  it yet, but I'm gonna code a small(ish) CLI util to
insert them for me!
<font color =#FFFFB8>
I'm just about to code it now, see you all soon ....

                            &lt;later on ....&gt;
<font color =#FFD0FF>
Phew!   It's  done!   I have used it on this article to show you what it
can  do  (the  colours for "By" and "BootB...." were done by myself, but
the rest was done by the util).

I  couldn't  come up with a name (I'm far too impatient to try to), so I
called the "The Word Colour Inserter" (V1.00).

Hopefully,  it'll  be in the "Goodies" drawer on the second disk of this
issue  (that's  if  Kei has included it and D!ck didn't delete it - D!ck
seems to delete most of my stuff (and no D!ck, they're NOT crap!)).

It's  a  LhA'd file and it contains the main executeable (TWCI), the doc
file  and  the source code in ASCII (just load it into Blitz 2).  If you
want to use TWCI, then READ THE DOCS FIRST!!!
<font color =#FFD0DC>
Well, I hope you like it!
