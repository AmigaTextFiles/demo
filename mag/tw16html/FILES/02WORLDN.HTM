Microsoft seem to be getting nearer to their goal of world domination in
the computer world.  I think we'd all sell our computers if they started
running Windows as the standard operating system...


                    MICROSOFT COMMITTED TO MACINTOSH

Microsoft  said  it  remains committed to meeting the needs of Macintosh
users,  regardless  of the latest management wrangles at Apple Computer.
Apple  late  Wednesday  said Chairman and Chief Executive Gilbert Amelio
resigned  Tuesday  night,  after struggling fruitlessly for 17 months to
return  the  company  to  profitability.  "Clearly this is an unsettling
time  for  Apple,"  Microsoft spokesman John Pinette.  "We wish them the
best  in  addressing  their  issues."  But  Microsoft still has a strong
business   selling   applications,   including   word   processors   and
spreadsheets,  to  Apple  users  and  repeatedly  has  said  it  remains
committed  to  those  customers.   Earlier this year, Microsoft chairman
Bill  Gates  met  with Amelio and other Apple executives in Apple's home
town  of  Cupertino  to  discuss  the possibility of closer cooperation.
"People  like  Apple  and would like them to succeed," Gates said at the
time.  "But that doesn't mean they will succeed."

                        NET LOTTERY MILLIONAIRE

The International Red Cross said today its new Internet lottery had made
its  first  millionaire.   The winner chose the six correct numbers from
his  home in Greece via the Internet and will receive 1.25 million Swiss
francs  ($861,000)  tax-free  in Liechtenstein on a draw made on July 4.
The  Red  Cross  launched  the  lottery  in benefit of humanitarian work
worldwide.   To  enter the game, players first have to set up an account
with  Plus  Lotto.   Their  account  is  then credited with winnings and
debited  for  each  bet they make.  The Red Cross federation receives 25
percent of the gross proceeds and 50 percent is paid out in prizes.  The
rest of the proceeds cover administration costs except for five percent,
which go to Liechtenstein charities.

                         New Amigas, new prices

Not  one but two new licensees to create Amiga-based computers have been
announced  in  a  sudden  flurry  of  activity from Amiga International.
First  off the starting blocks was MicroniK who will be housing standard
A1200  motherboards  in  their  Infinitiv tower system as disclosed last
month.   Now we have firm pricing details on the three different systems
being offered.

The  first, the A1300, is a base tower model with no Zorro slots, but as
with  all  these machines, adding them in is simply a matter of ordering
the part and fitting it yourself.  The other two have Zorro slots and an
incrementally larger price.

Index  Information  Ltd.   have  also  been  granted a licence and their
offering  is  actually  the  first  new  Amiga  for  four years.  It's a
completely  new  motherboard  design  based  on  the existing A4000, but
designed  to  fit into a standard 5.25 bay.  The Access, as the new unit
will  be  known,  is  primarily  designed for corporate use so if you're
interested  in  one  for  your  home,  don't  hold  your  breath.  Index
Information are planning a retail version of the Access, but it probably
won't be available at least until early next year.

Lastly,  if  you're interested in a barebones A1200 at a low price, then
Wizard's  announcement  should come as a welcome surprise.  They will be
selling  the  standard  A1200  for just £249.99 for the Amiga Magic pack
(and  DOpus  4.12).   For an extra £100 you can have 4Mb RAM and a 170Mb
hard drive.  Wizard are also doing more powerful bundles.

Contact  Blittersoft  on 01908 261466, Index Information on 01256 703426
and  Wizard  on  0181 303 1800 for more details or visit blittersoft and
Index's websites at:  www.blittersoft.com and www.cix.co.uk/~index/

                             64-MEG MEMORY

Declining  prices  in  the  memory  market  make it likely that computer
vendors will start using the newest 64-megabit memory chips, quadrupling
the  amount  of  memory  most  users get in today's desktops, later this
year.  The memory chips themselves are delivered on small circuit boards
called  modules.   New  modules containing 64-megabit memory chips would
allow PCs which currently come with 16 megabytes of memory, for example,
to  pack  in 64 megabytes in the same space.  Currently, these chips are
used  in  pricey  server computers and workstations.  Broader use should
begin to occur in 1998 with widespread deployment toward 1999, according
to analysts.  The adoption schedule of the chips will be determined in a
tug  of  war  between the chip makers and computer vendors.  Chip makers
want to shift to 64-megabit as soon as possible so they can recoup their
investments.   Computer makers, however, tend to favor lower cost memory
to  keep  overall  prices  low.   Memory  typically constitutes about 10
percent  of  a computer's cost.  The watershed moment for the transition
to  64-megabit  chips  from  16-megabit  chips  will  likely  come  when
approximately  a  4  to  1  pricing  ratio  exists between the two.  The
64-megabit  memory chip costs close to $250 in quantity in January 1996,
dropping to $90 by December 1996 and to around $40 to $45 today.  By the
end of the year, 64-megabit chips will sell in the $30 to $35 range.

                           Picasso IV update

Graphics  card  manufacturers  are notorious for promising all manner of
funky  add-ons  for their products which then never arrive.  Examples of
this  include  the  modules for the OpalVision, Merlin and CyberVision64
card,  but  it  seems that Village Tronic are really trying to break the
mould  in  this  respect.  Talking to Olaf Barthel, a sub-contractor for
support  software  for  the  excellent  Picasso IV, he revealed that the
modules were actually nearly ready:

"The sound card (Concierto) is finished, as far as I can tell, including
the support software, which includes AHI support.  There still are a few
questions   open  regarding  bundling/licensing,  but  these  should  be
resolved  soon  enough.  The Pablo II video encoder is finished as well,
but   I   haven't   written  any  support  software  for  it  yet.   The
TV-tuner/video  capture  module  is  in  the  making and very close to a
production  sample.   Just like with the Pablo II, I haven't written any
support software for it yet.  Also in the making is the announced Denise
adaptor  to allow the PicassoIV to work in an A2000/A3000 with the Video
Toaster plugged into the video slot.  I do not know its status, though."

	Unfortunately,  the  two  most  exciting  developments  for  the
PicassoIV,  the 3D module and PowerPC plug-in, have an unknown status at
the  moment because Village Tronic are trying to decide which chipset to
go  with,  but  this can be seen as a positive development for the Amiga
graphics  card-owning  community.   For  further details on the upcoming
boards,  give Blittersoft, the UK distributor for Village Tronic, a call
on 01908 261466.

                 MICROSOFT AND NETSCAPE TO JOIN FORCES

Threat from US Government is forcing an unprecedented alliance Microsoft
and  Netscape  Communications  Inc.   are  to  join  forces  to confront
proposed  US  Government  legislation  regulating business on-line.  The
bitter  rivals have agreed to put aside their differences in response to
the Government's new privacy laws which aim to protect the rights of the
world's Web surfers to privacy of information.  At the moment, there are
no  regulations  governing  how  a  Web  site's  administrators  can use
information  submitted upon registration, or gained via a cookie used by
the  Web  site  owner.   Cases of so-called spam e-mail have been on the
increase  lately and there have been some disturbing reports of some Web
site  operators  selling information gathered upon registration to third
parties.   Both Microsoft and Netscape have decided to argue for more of
a  self-regulatory  approach  to  the  situation.   Microsoft  has  also
recently   agreed   to  support  Netscape's  Netcaster  Push  technology
standards,  which  has  improved  the  chances  of  a  common  method of
'broadcasting'  content over the Net to a PC.  Until recently, it looked
like  the  technology  used  within  Internet  Explorer  4  and Netscape
Communicator was going to remain forever incompatible.

                           DOUBLE YOUR MONEY

New  software  aims  to  give  you  two PCs for the price of one You can
invest thousands of pounds in your Pentium PC, yet find that most of its
power goes to waste because only one person can use it at a time.  A new
package  from  Chase  Advanced Technologies is seeking to put this right
with  its new program,Sharedware.  Sharedware enables two users to share
the  same PC by employing individual keyboards and monitors, and Win95's
multitasking  abilities.  All you need to work this way is the software,
a Pentium PC, Win95, another monitor, keyboard and mouse, plus a minimum
of  16Mb  of RAM.  Chase claims that implementing Sharedware can save up
to  75 per cent of the costs of buying and running a second PC.  Setting
up  the  system  involves no more than slotting a card into a 16-bit ISA
slot  on  the  PC's motherboard and when active enables users to perform
any task D even share a modem D at the same time.  Chase claims there is
no  measurable  loss of performance when using the system and Sharedware
is  expected to cost something in the region of &amp;#156;250.  Look out for
a  full  review  next  month.  In the meantime, you can contact Chase on
(01275) 225000.

                       Possibility of new OctaMED

OctaMED  SoundStudio is not dead!  According to OctaMED UK publisher Ray
Burt  Frost,  Teijo  Kinunnen is committed to creating a new version for
the  Amiga despite the fact that, as he puts it, "all the Amiga versions
we  have  released  previously  have been pirated in the thousands, thus
making  the  years'  work a total waste of time".  Ray has said that the
new  version  is  not  likely to arrive this year and could only confirm
that  both  AHI  and  16-bit samples would be fully supported along with
plenty  of other, unrevealed, new additions to the program.  For further
details, visit the OctaMED web page at www.octamed.co.uk.

                               WINDOWS 98

Dave Pearman, editor of PC Plus, finds less than he expected in the next
release  of  Windows.   A couple of years ago we all had plenty to write
about  the  launch  of  Windows  95.  After all, Win95 was a substantial
change,  though  it  now seems to have been accepted as a change for the
better.   For  the  next major release, then, we should expect something
even  more  radical, shouldn't we?  Well, we're not going to get it, and
maybe  that's  not  so  bad.   The  current behind-the-scenes release of
Memphis  is, according to Microsoft, representative of most of the major
features  that  we  can  expect  in  the next, as yet unnamed release of
Windows.   What's  surprising  is that we've seen most of it before, and
some  of  it  is  even free.  The most obvious change is the adoption of
Internet  Explorer  4  as  an  extension  to  the Windows interface.  Of
course,  that's  available free from the Web, and will be even when it's
finished.  Next are the FAT32 filing system, which banishes wasted space
on  today's  big  hard  disks, and support for new hardware.  But aren't
these  already  in  Win95  OSR2, pre-installed on new PCs?  Remember the
Plus!   Pack?   Full-window  drag,  gliding  menus,  themes  and  stuff?
That'll  be  enhanced  and  thrown  in,  too.   OnNow  is new, and gives
notebook-like  fast  start and shutdown.  There are less obvious changes
under  the skin, but even these won't get you excited.  So, don't expect
Win98  to  make you go 'Wow!'.  Strangely, I think that's good news, but
only  if  the  three  years  of  development  have  been used elsewhere.
Microsoft  claims changes to the kernel and other code will make the new
release faster.  But let's hope it's more robust too.

                    OFFICIAL: MEMPHIS IS WINDOWS 98

Microsoft  (MSFT)  has finally said that Windows 98 is the official name
of  the  next  version  of Windows, code-named Memphis.  Windows 98 will
ship  in  the  first quarter of next year, said Jim Allchin, senior vice
president  of Microsoft's personal systems and business group.  A second
Windows  98  beta  is  going  out  today, he added.  In the past several
months,  company  representatives  have tried hard to convince the media
and  the  industry that there was indeed a chance of getting Memphis out
before  the  end  of the year.  However, as the Microsoft press division
earlier  this  summer printed up a run of books with "Windows 98" in the
title.   Last  week,  the company sent out Memphis betas to testers that
replaced  "Memphis"  with  "Windows  98" on display screens.  Windows 98
will  have  the  Internet  Explorer  browser  integrated  into  the main
interface.   In  the  week  since  the  latest  beta version of IE 4 was
released,  more than 1 million copies have been downloaded, according to
Maritz.   The  company also promised that the next version of the Office
97  application  suite  will cost 50 percent less to own and administer.
Microsoft  will  achieve  this  with  an  automatic software update "Web
channel"  and  fast  installation  of additional features from a central
server.   In  addition,  the  company  will create a future server-based
version  of  Office  that  needs no application files installed on local
machines.   Executives  did  not  give  a timetable for future versions.
Also  at  today's presentation, Microsoft said the first beta of Windows
NT  5.0  will  be  distributed  during  the first week of September at a
developer  conference  in  San  Diego.   And the company announced it is
shipping a small business server based on Windows NT 4.0 this quarter.
