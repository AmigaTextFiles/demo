<font color =#FFFF88>                       F.A.n.Q YOU DAVE DIAMOND!
                       -------------------------

<font color =#FFD0AC>                By Dave Diamond (the dude with attitude)
<font color =#FFD0E8>
Many  people  ask me frequently asked questions - I`m a celebrity so why
shouldn`t  they?   In this three part interview we find out about Dave`s
youth,his tormented childhood and how the transformation of a lonely boy
lead  to  the  creation  of  the  man  we all love today.  Here are some
questions  you  may have thought about over the past few months/years so
let`s get on with the show and interview Dave Diamond....


Q) What made you write this trilogy of F.A.Qs?
A) The idea stemmed fom a interview on WWF Raw Is War,a wrestling tv
   programme in which a character called `Mankind` was interviewed.
   He  is  an  excellent  interviewee  and gave some emotional documents
   about his youth and career.
   The piece really moved me as he went through more or less exactly the
   same thing I underwent in scool so I thought I`d write a F.A.Q so my
   readers would know about my history.
   As  the  readers  will  soon  know  about  in  this long and detailed
   trilogy.

Q) Will  you  ever  scan a photo of yourself and distribute it for your
   fans to see?
A) I have drawn some pictures of myself that have been doing the rounds
   recently.
   I  think  the  time will come when I`m virtually everywhere text wise
   and  so  the  fans  and  readers will be absolutley gasping to see my
   photo to see if I live up to what I say I look like.
   So  I  guess  I`ll  eventually get around to doing so but only when I
   have regular articles in InterNet site pages,possibly my own site and
   on bulletin boards and computers around the world.

Q) What are you like to be around?
A) I`m  a funny person,very shy and someone who always has something to
   say if interested in the subject.
   I`m a polite,handsome individual (!) who has the most caring and
   wonderfull personality a girl could ever hope to wish for.

Q) Why did you first write articles? What did you hope to acomplish?
A) I  first  wrote  articles to get my views `out there` and to try and
   mussle up a few friends.
   I  didn`t  try to acomplish anything but now that the article writing
   has  increased  200% I hope that I can interest people enough to read
   my articles and so they will have something to look forward to.
   Generally  though  I  would like the knowlege that I`ve acomplished a
   task to entertain all my readers in a frank and witty way.

Q) Why do you write so many articles?
A) I have nothing better to do! Plus I love talking (or rather writing)
   about subjects I feel my "fans" would like to read about.
   I have no job and so I put all my effort in writing (hopefully)
   entertaining and thought provoking articles.

Q) Why the humour in most of your articles?
A) It`s  best  to  refer  to  the  article  `Diamond  Pathos`  for more
   information  but  I  feel  it`s  best to capture an `audience` with a
   crazy and fun style of writing rather than a conservative approach.
   If  you  had  a  boring  documentary and a wacky,fun documentary both
   talking  about  the  same  subject  matter  I would always go for the
   latter and I suppose many others would too.

Q) You  always  mention  your  "fans"  why  is this and do you have any
   `genuine` fans of your work?
A) I  mention  my  fans  because  they are the people who keep the Dave
   Diamond legacy alive,if there were no fans then there wouldn`t be any
   point in continuing my articles.
   I do have real fans such as Mammoth and The Arab - who first got me
   aware of my true entertainment value.

Q) You  seem  to  be saying that your articles are just `entertainment`
   surely  your serious topics about life,drugs etc aren`t just a chance
   for a bit  of fun?
A) Of course not,I try and make my articles a place for people to turn
   to,so if I talk about a serious topic like rape,even though I would
   make it as dramatic as possible to get the readers attention I would
   always end with some fun factor so that reader wouldn`t go away with
   the impression that the world is doomed.
   I`ve made my point so that the readers understands what I`m trying to
   say and also they feel better at the end of the article.

Q) Your  facination  with  Melissa  Joan  Hart  has made some engrosing
   articles  to  see  `what happens next`,taking that from your `Therapy
   Tape`  you`re  a  great  actor  so  can  I  assume that these various
   articles  are just another well produced sketch at Melissa`s expense?
A) No the Melissa articles were (unfortunatley) a genuine cry for help,I
   wouldn`t  write  an  article  at  someone  elses  expense unless they
   deserved  it  for  instance  the Hugh Grant/Divine situation would be
   appropriate as he should have known better.

Q) Many other writers that contribute articles seem to stick to certain
   genres  for  example  sport  or computing code where-as you cover all
   areas why  is  this?
A) Those writers are good at writing what they know about,for example
   BootBlock could write for pages on end about Blitz Basic where-as I
   couldn`t as I dont know anything about that subject.
   I tend to write about stuff that interests me,the readers and also a
   chance to get things off my chest.
   Many  other  writers could stray from their chosen path but they like
   what they write so they stick with it,I couldn`t do that as it`s too
   restrictive and I`d find it boring after a while.

Q) There  used  to be quite a few adult articles in The Word before you
   came along...what happened?
A) I  think  that when The Word went quiet for such a long time most of
   the adult writers gave up.
   If  they  aren`t  still  sending in their articles then they probably
   fear being too stale after what I`ve wrote!

Q) So you`re the king of adult articles then?!
A) Yes,and hopefully other genres too!!

Q) Talking of adult articles why are you still continuing to submit
   revealing articles after what`s already been distributed.
A) I`ll  do  anything  to get that one reader to read my work and if it
   takes shocking material at my expense then so be it!
   I`ll keep on writing about sex and various other adult topics for as
   long as I have something to say.

Q) What was your initial thoughts when you first saw your adult articles
   in The Word issues 11 &amp; 12?
A) At  first  I  though  `Oh  god!!`  as  Freak (the then editor of the
   magazine) didn`t want to include them as they were TOO revealing!

<font color =#FFFF4C>[I  was  the  editor  from issue 11.  I still only let 90% of your adult
articles in based on content and subject matter.  Kei]
<font color =#FFD0E8>
Q) If any of your fans actually met you,would you be the wise-cracking
   flamboyant character we all know and love?
A) That`s  a  hard  question to answer as I`m a very,very shy person in
   real life even though the Dave Diamond character does creep out in
   some alarming situations and events.
   So  I  wouldn`t know,there`s no telling what `character` I`ll play if
   you ever met me,only the long time people know what I`m really like.

Q) So you`re not like you `other half` then?
A) No Dave Diamond is the complete reverse of myself.

Q) You say that Dave Diamond is a character???
A) Find out more next time!
