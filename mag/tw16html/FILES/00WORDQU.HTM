                Word Readership Evaluation Questionnaire

                       Created by Kei of Carnage

 During  a  recent  conversation,  the  question was asked "What sort of
person  reads  The Word?".  This lead onto other questions regarding the
percentages  of  word readers that own a PC, have internet access or are
on a computer scene of some sort.
 I  decided that since some of you send in article contributions and the
rest  obtain  their  copies  of  The  Word  through  a Carnage member or
associate, that  I should get feedback from you so we can get an average
Word  reader  template  which  we  can use to gain a better idea of "Who
reads The Word?".
 So  we,  the  Word  staff  hope  you will take the time to fill in this
questionnaire   and   send  it  in  to  us.   Here's  how  to  get  your
questionnaire in to my hands:

1)  Mail  it  to  The  Word Diskback address on one of your disks.  (You
know, the one with the articles on that you really really really want to
write and send in to us!).

2)  Email  it  to  keiofcarnage@geocities.com 

3) Complete the on-line version located at:

           http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Castle/4500/

..and press SUBMIT and everything will be taken care of!

4)  Email  it to another Carnage member or Dick at Dick@emarkt.com Other
members emails should be in an article somewhere within this issue.

Ok, on with the questionnaire.  Please answer as much of it as possible,
just  turn  on  your favourite music (preferably loud), keep that can of
cherry cola nearby and have phun...

Thanks  for  completing  this  questionnaire.  Make as much space as you
want  when answering the questions by frequent use of the RETURN key.  A
handle,  nickname  or alias is all we need as well as your age to gain a
better  idea  of  who  out  there  is reading The Word.  The rest of the
questions  give  us  more  detail  and  are  fun to answer with the last
section being more informative to us.

The  results  will  be posted as a file in a future issue and will be in
the format :

"Who Reads The Word?

 A  Word  reader  is aged between xx and xx and has been using computers
for xx years on average...."

 Get the idea?
