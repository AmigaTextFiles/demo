While  watching  BBC  one  night  they  featured a game by some american
called  schoolyard  slaughter in which the aim was to kill kids like the
hit  game  zombie  appocalypse.  They showed the firm (penguin software)
and  that  the  manager  said that they had recieved the game a year ago
before  dunblane  (yeah right).  The whole fuss was the sickness of this
game,yes  ok  it`s  sick  but hang on a minute I have a few points here,
first  they put the final nail in the amigas coffin by showing the amiga
a600 computer, why?  they also showed the games graphics from afar so my
point  is  this if they are so opposed to this then why show the game at
all?   surely  some kid is going to think `hey that looks a great game I
think  I`ll  get that`.  Secondly what about the game Doom?  that wasn`t
on  the  TV  now  was  it  but the game is about killing every dam thing
right?   The  media  is to blame for this as they encourage people to do
these  crimes  by  constantly  bombarding us with images of violence and
crime.

The  amiga  kicks ass and I dont care about this game at all, so get off
the amigas back you bastards!!!!!


<font color =#FFFF4C>[Censorship  laws  are getting tougher and extreme violence in commerial
games  in  the  future is to be more closely monitired.  A recent survey
released  by  the Home Office says that violence is caused mostly by the
entertainment  industry  and  needs to be monitored more closely by Mary
Whitehouse types.  Send your views in now..  Kei]
