 To  give  you  an  example of how a thread can be compiled into a short
story.  Here enters Sandman..

The  rain  outside  was  heavy, and the disturbance of pressure when the
door opened sent a near tsunami into the bar.

The  tall,  thin figure in the doorway was silhouetted against the neons
from  outside.   A  halo  of  rainfall  surrounded  him, pounding at his
duster.

Ratz looked over.  No recognition showed in his eyes.

The  man  entered, let the door swing shut behind him.  A grateful quiet
fell  upon the room as the wind found its gateway blocked.  He walked to
the bar, never once taking his eyes off Ratz.

Ratz  returned  the  gaze.  Ankle-length duster, battered and worn.  Big
floppy  black  leather  hat, outback style.  Black jeans, a t-shirt that
read,  in  luminous green, EXIT.  Clean shaven - sort of - and with eyes
like  burning  coals,  two  fiery  pits  of  hell (Nikon S2-11's).  Ratz
couldn't see any sidearms, but he just knew the guy was packing.

"Hi, Ratz."

"Do  I  fucking  know you?" Whirr-click.  A metal fist on the end of the
arm.

"I'm looking for Godeater."

"Well, he's in a lot these days.  Shouldn't have to wait long."

"JD coke.  Thanks."

Ratz  turned  away to make the drink.  The stranger turned to survey the
bar.   While  he  wasn't looking, Ratz signalled to Godeater, settled at
the end of the bar reading a mono greenscreen someone was showing him on
a notebook.  Godeater looked up.  Ratz nodded at the stranger.  Godeater
shook his head, shrugged, examined the stranger.

Ratz  placed the drink on the bar.  The stranger turned round, picked it
up, tossed Ratz some change.

"Thanks, Ratz."  He started to walk straight towards Godeater.

The  third  man  closed  the  notebook  and  stood  back as the stranger
approached.  Hand on trigger.

"Can I help you?"  asked Godeater.

"I'm the Sandman."  Just like that, with a capital S.

"Well, shit.  I was wondering when you'd show your face."

Sandman  tossed half the whisky back.  "Just want to make my peace, man.
Second  Hiway  Girl  piece  -  much  better.   Less irrelevance.  I hate
irrelevance."

"Er, thanks."

Sandman  sat  down,  next to Godeater.  The third man still stood behind
Godeater.   "Although  I  remember  you  condemning  violence in POET 2.
Strange,  considering Hiway Girl's content." He turned to the third man.
"You nightshade?"

"Yeah.  How'd you know."  Suspicious.

"I  read  everything.   Good post on that screen there." Gestured to the
notebook.
"Any previous that might have been before my time?"  Turned to Ratz.
"Whatever these two want."

Nightshade  settled  into the seat on the other side of Godeater as Ratz
brought the drinks over.

"Maybe."

"Good."  Sandman smiled for the first time.

&gt;God  Eater  winced  as  the  man  off the net assumed a position beside
him...He  had  started to get a little annoyed at all these new entries,
this  person waltzes in, says something very solemnly witty and menacing
to  Ratz  and quietly lays claim to the title of bad ass motherfucker of
the universe...  All these fucking guns just itching to go off...None of
this  was  very  cool  at  all,  everybody  so  fucking  uptight  taking
themselves  to be the fourth horseman of the apocalypse...This place had
gone  to  shit...Too  many tough guys sauntering around...Except for him
and  Joe  Ordinary...shit, he might just have to start a little place of
his  own, members only kind of place, good writing and talk and no tough
guys allowed.  He already had a name.

With  an unearthly suddenness, the door flung open.  A blur - blue neon,
here a fleck of green - whipped around the bar.  Godeater could hear the
cock of hammers from around the room.  He winced again.

Sandman  pulled  an  unfeasibly  large caliber handgun out of his duster
pocket,  levelled  it  in  the direction of the blur.  A deafening whine
began,  a tornado forming in the centre of the bar.  Sandman let several
shots fly at the tornado.  The ricochets damn nearly hit Ratz.  Starting
to  panic, Sandman pulled a doublebarrel out of his coat, cocked it, let
loose.

Nothing.

The  tornado  slowed, the blur started to congeal.  Godeater squinted in
recognition...

"ELITIST MAN!" he shouted.  The figure now standing in the centre of the
bar  wore  blue  neon  tights and top with a greenscreen sash across his
chest.  He nodded in Godeater's direction, then turned to Sandman.

"Sandman,  AKA  Justicar,  AKA  Tony  Johnston  -  I  find you guilty of
innumerable  crimes against fiction writing and the cyberpunk genre as a
whole!  The sentence is...DEATH!"

Sandman  began  to  protest,  on  his knees.  "No...No...Please, Elitist
Man!"

But  EM  was  having none of it.  He picked Sandman up by his collar and
flung  him  against the bar.  "We'll see how tough you really are..." he
began  pounding  Sandman's  face, pounding and blood flowing and bruises
and broken bones and blood and blood...

Godeater  woke with a start to find Sandman watching him from across the
table.

"Ease  up,  G," the tall man said, "gonna give yourself an ulcer at this
rate."  He  chuckled,  downed  another JD&amp;C.  "The use of violence in my
fiction   is   kept  strictly  to  relevance  -  apart  from  senseless,
meaningless  random  acts  of  violence, which last time I looked out my
window, were very much a part of real life as we know it.

"The  jaded  attitude  you  have  toward something you obviously used to
participate  in  is  very  common  in  genre  readers  -  call it the CP
backlash, if you will.

"In  1990,  nothing  could have been cooler than lots of wetware, enough
SKIPS  to hold the Encyclopeadia Britannica, and BIG, BIG guns.  Now, in
1995,  times have changed - much as Alan Moore revolutionized comix with
naturalistic  (and realistic) tales of everyday people with problems, as
Tarantino has done in the cinema with his hitmen who argue about whether
pigs are filthy, so too has CP changed, for the better in my opinion.

"The  opening  up  to allcomers of any genre is to be welcomed, surely -
before  the  cookery  programme  boom in the 80s, chefs were an elitist,
closely  guarded  bunch.   Now  top chefs are celebrities - are they any
less respected for it?  No!  Probably MORE respected, by MORE people, as
people are curious and eager to learn.

"There  is  room in CP for all styles of storytelling - Snow Crash isn't
really  an  SF  story at all, it just uses the setting to facilitate the
telling of the plot, and a damned good one it is, too.  Jeff Noon hardly
uses  technology  at all, but the attitude is there.  Even His Most Holy
Mr  Gibson  isn't that interested in the tech itself...but then some, as
Walter  Jon Williams, are, and he too is as valid as you or I.  There is
space for all of us.

"Not  all of my fiction is CP, certainly not all is violent.  Some of it
is  akin  to  poetry,  and  song  lyrics of mine tend to reflect tragedy
rather than violence.  Nevertheless, CP and violence are useful literary
vehicles,  and  we shouldn't deny ourselves their use.  Do you now scorn
books  you  read  as  a  child  that you enjoyed?  Does the very idea of
someone  actually  enjoying  Die  Hard 3 make your blood boil?  Perhaps.
But  there is no fault in enjoying a 'ripping yarn' even though the plot
may have holes in it the size of the moon.

"Think on this.  Farewell."

And with that, Sandman rose and left, tossing Ratz more change.

Godeater watched him leave with visible distaste.

"Smartass."

Vic pulled his shades down, peering over the tops.

"I think I know this guy from somewhere..." he said.


"I TOLD you this was gonna get good," said Jetta.

"Hey!"  snapped  Vic,  putting  a  finger to his lips.  "Shut up.  We're
next."

"Dammit, I feel cheated," muttered Jetta.

"Uh-oh," said Vic.

"Rationalization,"  Jetta  observed.   "I  didn't think it was gonna get
THIS nasty."

"This  guy's  not  pulling  any  punches,"  said Vic.  He glanced at the
Ghost.   "It  usually  doesn't  come  to this here.  Usually it's just a
straight-up, honest-to-God bloodbath with plenty of people getting blown
to hell.  Why the hell hasn't Ratz gotten some decent security in here?"

"You  oughta  ask  him  if  he's  hiring,"  said Jetta.  She watched the
ongoing confrontation.  "If this gets any worse, I'm outta here."

"Oh, this is REALLY getting nasty now," said Jetta.  She started digging
through  her  pockets  for  money.   "I'd say it's about time we started
moving."

"You  know,  that's  a  valid  point," said Vic, his eyes glazed and far
away.  Jetta swore and grabbed him by the collar, shaking him violently.

"SNAP OUT OF IT!" she shouted.  "WAKE UP!"

He blinked.  "Whoa.  What the hell happened?"

"It's  REALLY  time to go now," she said.  She slapped a wad of bills on
the countertop, not even bothering to count them.  They were in a hurry.

"Just  walk,"  whispered  Jetta.   "Right  out  the door.  Look straight
ahead.  Don't try to stare anyone down, huh?  I don't want to be next."

"Couldn't you change your style?" asked the Ghost.

"Fuck no.  Keep walking."


"Quick!" she said.  "They might not notice us!"

"We're safe," said Vic.  "They didn't see us."

"Thank  GOD," said Jetta, breathing a sigh of relief.  "Damn, that was a
close one."

"They might come looking," he warned.

"Let's duck our heads for a while again," she said.  "I am REALLY not in
the mood for that sort of thing right now."

"So what now?" he asked.

"Dunno,"   she  said,  shrugging.   "Guess  we  could  always  walk  out
somewhere, shoot some people, and tell someone about it."

He raised his eyebrow.  "Actually, I'm getting a little bored of that."

"Yeah.   Me  too.   I was kidding." Suddenly, struck by inspiration, she
snapped her fingers.  "I know!  I know what we can do!"

"What?" he asked.

"That  plot  thing!"  she shouted.  "Remember how we were always looking
for one?"

"Yeah.  Found one?"

"I know where one is!" she said.  "Maybe we can find it!"

"I'm game," he said, shrugging.

God  Eater  stared  around  in  bewiderment.   His life had been getting
progressively  wierder  for the past few days, he figured this was a bit
of  a  climactic  moment.  He wasn't sure who or what he addressed these
days so he aimed this one at a relatively smoke and stench free patch of
thin air approximately located three feet above his table.

   "In  the  past months, I have matured a lot.  I have not forgotten my
initial  entrance here at the chatsubo, my tough guy antics with flaming
mugs  and  solemn pronouncements.  But now things have changed.  Many of
my  would be detractors comment without understanding the nature of this
boy's  mind.   I  am  sixteen  years  old  and  my  life  is  an ongoing
revolution.   Everyday's attitude is a relentless purging of yesterdays,
my  opinions  change more often than the weather and in far more drastic
ways.

Everything  I say or produce will be outdated and rejected by the end of
the  week.   I am constantly evolving and progressing as time whips past
it drags me along at it's breakneck pace.  All I can do about this state
of  affairs is to try not to make any claims or statements so drastic as
I  am  full  well aware that I will be tearing them down in disgust come
next  thursday.   In  general I speak freely and openly and call it as I
see  it.   You lot have a number of choices in how you can deal with me,
Violent  and  powerful  disgust/hatred,  bemused detcachment, get on the
bandwagon  and the most popular just live with it, because as often as I
change  one  thing  always  remains the same.  I will change again.  The
best  and  most highly recommended approach, in my opinion, is dont take
me  or yourself too seriously, fuck it, relax.  It's just turned three o
clock  back  here in Real life and I'm tired.  this has been a broadcast
of  the  GE personal revolution broadcast system, stay tuned for further
updates.  Theres always more."

GE flops forward onto the table, skull whacking against the table with a
dull  thonk.   He  lies  as  a discarded marionette at a childs birthday
party, on to better things.
