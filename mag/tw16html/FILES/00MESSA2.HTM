I  take exception to your comments about the mighty N.C.F.C.  I mean how
can  you  slag a team off that Ian Crook chose to stay with us over your
bunch  of  handbag  wielding pansies.  So o.k you finished the season in
the  playoffs  and we finished lower than you, but we had almost all our
first  team  out  injured  for  half the season.  It will be a different
story  next  season,  with  the  yellow  and  green army promoted to the
premier league and the crappy blues relegated to division 2.

Anyway  what a bag of total shite James fucking Scowcroft is, he doesn't
even start to compare with the talents of Dazza Eadie and Kieth O'Neill.
And  that  fucking  Alan Brazil, Sky TV should tell him to sling his fat
fucking  biased  hook, if they can get him to remove his slimy cock from
George Burley's warty arse.  So next time the mighty City crush the puny
Town 10-0.  I will remember your slimy jealous comments and laugh a evil
sadistic  chuckle  to  myself and whisper under my breath "Choke on that
you  fucking  oversized cheese mould".  By the way BootBlock agrees with
me 100%.  $9ff [Oi, don't bring me into this yer bag of beef dripping, I
don't  even  like  turdy footie.  Anyone that says "Soccer" needs a reet
f'kin KICKING!  (ie.  Americans) - BB/TrF].


TO: Kei/Carnage
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

Yeah, but Dave Diamond is supposed to fix the car and that Chinese bloke
is  telling  him  the  instructions,  right?  But, where do you come in?
....

        Chinese Geeza   =   PeeCee game
        Dave Diamond    =   CPU
        Kei/Carnage     =   Emulator?

So,  you  are  the translator (the emulator), which means Dave can't fix
the  car without you, as he can't understand Chinese.  My point exactly!
I  know  what you mean about the architecture (spelt right?), but I just
came  out  with  the  example  while  I  was typing away, and anyway, it
would've turned into an article if I had typed anymore!  :)

Chinese Porno mags?  Yes please!  :P


TO: D!ck
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

Look!   You're  turning  into a PeeCee owner!  Why?  My Matrox blah blah
DirectX  blah-dee-bloh 512k bluergh, caches bloop IRQ bleeoph I luv paph
Bill Gate's, bleeph rectum phoophy.  Argh, shat it!

You  power  supply  killer,  pink day-glo slinky fondler, thumb cutting,
fusing blowing, trapdoor lid nabbing bag of LARD!  You're the cheap lard
from Netto's, I'm the dead expensive stuff, me.

Hey,  got  any  nice pix of Chloë Annett or Belinda Carlisle in Bodyshop
Central   ?    Hmmm...    wait   till   I   get   me   cable   line  and
modulator/de-modulator, I'll be raiding the bloody place!


TO: Zee Germans (or "Fuzzy Wuzzies")
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

Oi,  you  said you would like a game of football for deciding things?  I
vote we should have a WAR!  Héi Hitler!


TO: Mammoth/Syndicate
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

Where  are you m8?  And why are you sending me 17 disks?  Are they blank
or is there some good pervy stuff on them?  :)

An 8-bitplane scrolltext in 1 frame?  Easy!


TO: BattleAngel
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

Soz  to hear about your pooter dying.  It'll take you months to reply to
my  72k  letter!   (yes readers, that was 72k !).  Mine was big, but how
big will yours be?  :D


TO: Kei/Carnage
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

Kei,  I'm  thinking  of  moving groups and was wondering about trying to
join Carnage.  What is the criteria for joining?

I'm  a  coder  (Blitz 2), beginner-ish ray-tracer (Cinema4D II), sampler
dude  and a swapper.  And obviously an article writer (fer The Word only
- I pledge my eternal support).  Any good?

Oh,  I'll  also be getting a cable line &amp; modem soon, so I'll be nobbing
every board I can find (I've got to get to know how to use a modem/board
first!) !


To: Bootblock/Terraform and Anyone
Fm: Kei/Carnage

Just  send  examples  of your work to me.  All we really require is that
you  own a computer that can read either a PC or Amiga disk and that you
love computers so much that you sometimes forget you have a girlfriend.


TO: All my contacts
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

Sorry,  I'll  reply to you all soon, as I've got loads of coding/article
writing to do.  I may stop swapping...  until I get a modem.


TO: Anyone
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

Can  someone  tell  me what the hell (AmigaShell) pipes are?  All I know
is, they are used for storing things.

Also,  you  know  them  Doc  disks  that  used to be about (full docs on
commerical  programs, etc) ?  Does anyone know of anything similiar, but
for  PlayStation games?  If anyone is willing to write a PSX doc(s) out,
then  send  it/them to me and I'll create the ultimate diskmag interface
for them!


TO: Any females that read The Word
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm (or Clitty Flicker)

Write  in  for  Venus's  sake!   Let yourself been known!  Are there any
women  out  there that know how to use a text-editor?  If so, then WRITE
IN!   No articles about knitting or "Does He Really Love You?" type pooh
flakes, thanks.  Although, info on how to create an imitation fadge will
be gratefully appreciated by Dave Diamond. 


TO: Dave Diamond/The Invaders
FM: BootBlock/TerraForm

Reasons for my cack-like jiffy ....

 1. Are you sure disks 1 and 2 wasn't in the pack of QB'd disks?
 2. I didn't include the Big Time Sensuality mod because I
    couldn't find it! Anyway, I've found it now.
 3. Yeah, I forgot about the postage.
 4. TransWrite spell checker? Whoops! Be with ya soon m8.
 5. There ain't any Cinema4D docs!! I had to learn it myself!
    (There's no way AmigaFormat were gonna give the manual to
    C4D II away!! It'll be at least twice as big as the main mag!)

The  reason why I "took my time" (I didn't, did I?), is because I've got
LOADS of coding to do (BlitzAMC, etc).  By the way, I'm NOT A CRACKER!

Er... my sister is 17 yrs old. No, I ain't got a recent photo!

If you're serious about doing a diskmag, then get BlitzAMC when it comes
out, as the rest that are currently out are crap!

Tit sucking is not a bad thing!!  :)

Wales  has  got  some weird sounding places....  like Ebbw Vale (how the
hell do you say `Eddw' ?!), Brynmawrm, etc.
