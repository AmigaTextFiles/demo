<font color =#FFFFFF>Using a PC PSU for the amiga


                              by john/indi


<font color =#884C4C>**WARNING**

This  is  a  hardware  hack which enables a cheap PC PSU to power amigas
from a500 to a1200 ( NOT big box amigas obviously ).  Please do not take
these  diagrams  as  gospel, they are correct in my experience BUT check
all voltages with a multimeter before connecting your amiga.  I will not
be held responsible ( blah blah etc.  ).


<font color =#FFFFFF>Has your crappy amiga power brick ever given up on you?  Been ripped off
for a goliath or similar "high wattage" PSU.  No?  Shit.

Well read on anyway, it may happen some day.
 
Get  a  hold  of  an old PC power supply, you'll get one from a computer
fair  for  less  than  £5.  Using a multimeter (if you aint got one then
give up now.) check the voltages on one of the large 4-wire female ends.
They should match up with this.  All voltages are DC.

                           +12v           +5v
                             _______________
                            /               \
                           |  O   O   O   O  |

                                  0v  0v      


<font color =#FFFFFF>Check  all  voltages to be sure, all PSU's that I've tested (dozens) are
configured  this  way but some older units may suffer from lack of volts
on  one  wire  or more.  Anything less than 11.9v and 4.9v should not be
used as this will drop slightly when on load.

If  your  amiga  PSU  is still alive then check the voltages on the male
plug end.  They should match up with this.  Again all DC voltages.

                              Voltages...

                            1 -  +12v dc
                            2 -    0v dc
                            3 -    0v dc
                            4 -   +5v dc
                            5 -    earth


<font color =#FFFFFF>If  your  PSU  is dead then don't worry, ALL amiga supplies from A500 to
A1200 are the same.


Now  simply  chop  the  cable  off  the amiga supply where it leaves the
brick,  peel  back  the  insulation,  and  connect  to the corresponding
voltages  on  the PC unit.  Put connection 5 down to earth, under a case
fixing  screw or something.  Keep the joints inside the PSU if possible,
keeps  it nice and tidy, but there are no dangerous voltages involved so
make  a pudding joint outside if you want :) Seriously though, use a bit
of  solder to make the joint safe, if your hard drive loses voltage when
it's  reading  it  sounds  like  the  heads  have  hit a brick wall, not
recommended.
                                                                                
Once  all  the connections are made then check AND DOUBLE CHECK that the
voltages are as specified in the amiga diagram.

A standard sized PC PSU should be enough to power any accesories you may
want  to  add,  DO  NOT  be tempted though to power an IDE CD drive from
within  your  amiga,  the teeny weeny circuit board tracks will not take
it.
