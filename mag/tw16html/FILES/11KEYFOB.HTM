<FONT SIZE=7>Keyfobs!</FONT><BR>
A D!crosoft 2020 "freeware" document!</CENTER>
<BR><FONT COLOR=#C1CDDA>
To celebrate our recent court victory (see last issue), as well as the
renaming of "D!crosoft" to "D!crosoft 2020" we are very pleased to give
away - completely free of charge - this money saving (and potentially
money spinning and completely royalty-free) file!
<P></FONT><FONT COLOR=#C1FCDA>
Evidently you can now buy keyfobs of your favourite Wallace and Gromit
characters to carry around with you, these sell for a couple of quid,
but using this document you can create your own, almost for nothing!
<P></FONT><FONT COLOR=#FFCDFF>
The keyfobs are exactly the same figured as those found in Kelloggs 
Cornflakes and Rice Crispies a short while ago, and the same figures
are being sold at Woolworth's in sets of four for three quid a time.
<P></FONT><FONT COLOR=#FFCDC1>
All you have to do is buy a packet of eye-hooks, these are basically
loops of metal with a screw-thread on them so that you can screw them
into a wall to provide a loop where you can then hang your net curtains
or whatever, these sell for approximately 79p a packet from Wilko's.
<P></FONT><FONT COLOR=#DAF9C1>
Take one of these hooks and screw it firmly into the head of your free
or cheap-from-Woolworths Wallace and Gromit figure, and hey presto, you
have created a Wallace and Gromit keyfob for a fraction of the cost!
<P></FONT><FONT COLOR=#DAF9FF>
You can now sell these for 1.50-2.00 quid each at your local car-boot
sale and make a fortune, or just have one on your keyfob and look extra
cool and trendy!  You can also create characters that are not available
in key-fob form, like Gromit and Preston!
