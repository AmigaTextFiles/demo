Dear Word..

Ahhhh  I tell you, I`m totally beat, I was up last night with 40 women -
all in the same bed - all after the same thing.....the pillow.

 Dear Dave

 Glad  to  hear you haven't lost your sense of humour.  We were starting
to  get  worried  that you'd forgotten us or were unable to write due to
hairy palms or blindness.  Well my mother said if..

                  CLOTHING - WHO GET'S AWAY WITH MORE?

Something  interesting,  that  not  many  people seem to think of.  If a
woman  goes  around  in  a  skirt  50cm above their knee, they get often
looked  upon  as  a  bit  of  a tart, but have you noticed if a man goes
around in a pair of shorts the same legnth, no one even bats an eyelid.

So  what's really the difference apart from a pair of shorts has a join,
that's  it,  is  that  the  reason?   It's wierd, because a man can walk
around  with  no  shirt  on  through  the town centre, but a woman wears
anything  a bit revealing..  slag.  It's still the case that male bodies
are more accepted in society, unfair if you ask me.

Any comments on this?

 Dear Dan

 As long as women are allowed to wear sweet fa in public then I'm afraid
we don't wish to complain.  We don't call them slags however but relief.
As  for  guys,  I'm  afraid  I don't give two hoots what they wear to be
honest  as long as it's not a "I love Windows 95" T-Shirt because that's
just asking for it!  ;)

In  issue  11  of the word I placed an advert for help to get me to meet
girls  and  due  to  an overwhelming response from 0 I would like to ask
that is it because none of us can pull birds?

Come on guys, the blow up doll is punctured and I`m desperate.

 Dear Dave

 Since  this  "article" was classed as too small to be an article it has
some how found it's way into my mailbag.  The answer to your question is
probably  that  not  many  girls read the Word as yet.  However with the
Word  going  on-line  from  this  issue,  we calculate about another 300
people  will  read  your articles a week so your best bet is to put away
the  puncture  repair kit and get typing those articles designed to "hit
the spot".

A letter I recieved the other day....

Dear Mr.Diamond,
                It  has  come  to  our attention that you have written a
number  of  articles  about your sexual fantasies and stories in various
computer publications and on the World Wide Web.

A  number  of  our girls are very fond of your writings and so they have
asked  me  to deliver an invitation for you to attend a photo shoot with
our girls and for myself on behalf of my managers company to offer you a
substantial wage to pose for our July issue centerfold fully nude.

Such benefits would come your way with dates and sexual ecstasy with our
many wonderfull ladies.

Please  let  me know as soon as possible so we can make arrangements for
the shoot.

Thanking you in advance.

A.Studd
(Head of photo shoots,Playboy Magazine)


I  of  course  declined  the  offer  as the Razzle Magazine offered more
lucrative offers!

 Did  you  explain  your  problems  regarding  arriving  to  early  when

 Dear Dave

 We,  the  Word  staff  can't  really go around letting everyone get the
impression  that  certain people are not worth contacting unless several
different  people  tell  us the same thing.  I must also remind you Dave
that  when  you  originally  wrote  for  contacts a while back, you came
across  as  so lame that it just wasn't worth a response.  Even I didn't
reply  to  your  letter.   However, Dick did and through him you started
contributing  to  the Word and then re-contacting me where my opinion of
you  has  changed  somewhat.   However,  in this world we live in today,
first impressions count so it might mot be them but you.  I can actually
comment  here  that  Carp is a great contact of mine.  I traded with him
years  ago  and recently we started up again.  He's a lot faster than me
and gets good stuff fast but if you came across as being a "know it all"
or "no-nothing" then he may not reply.

 Yes.  Articles travel various routes to get to me.  Those that come via
the  BBS and contacts of Carnage take longer and therefore may appear in
a future issue so keep looking!  Those that come direct to me through my
letterbox  or  via  email usually get published 99.9% of the time unless
they  contain  something  so  illegal  that after a discussion among the
staff, we have decided not to publish it.
 It's  also  worth mentioning that over the past few issues, things have
been  in a bit of a state here at Word central as we've had to re-direct
mail  and  change  addresses  due  to  people  moving.  Mail going to 41
Lambourne  Drive  is  still  being  re-directed and any mail going to 59
Waldeck is lost as Amida moved and there is no one there to redirect the
mail.   To  guarantee  your  articles  arriving  at the correct address,
always  reply  to  the LATEST issue of The Word.  The current address is
107B  Newton  Road  so  make  a  note of it.  You can confirm receipt by

                           "DAVE DIAMOND QUITS!"


On  the  05/04/97  I  decided after reading the news that my former love
(you  know  who she is by now) has a boyfriend.  Distraught I felt there
was no need for me to continue writing as the very life was drained from
my  soul  after reading that line.  There is now no need for me to go on
as  the  only  thing  that  kept me sane was knowing that I`ll always be
hunting  high  and  low, as there`s no end to the lengths I`d go to find
her,  now  that  she has a boyfriend the last drop of ability I have was
shed.

"I`M  HUNTING  HIGH  AND  LOW  AND  NOW  THEY`RE TELLING ME SHE`S GOT TO
GO.....AWAY"

"I`LL ALWAYS BE HUNTING HIGH AND LOW .....ONLY FOR YOU"

"WATCH  ME  TEARING MYSELF TO PIECES HUNTING HIGH AND LOW THERE`S NO END
TO THE LENGTHS I`D GO TO.....

"FOR YOU I`LL BE HUNTING HIGH AND LOW"

The final Tear Of Love has been wept.

 Kei/Carnage,

Congratulations on another excellent production!  The Word #15 is really
cool  and  I think the colourful menu bar works just fine.  It isn't any
harder to use at all, and the clock is a nice touch too.

I only started reading the Word last year (I was at my mates house, that
is  - my mate with the CD-ROM drive....  Damn him!) and I found some old
editions  and  really  enjoyed reading them.  He told me he didn't think
they  were being made anymore because Freak was getting tired of them or
something  like that.  But now that I'm on the interNET with my peecee I
can download the new ones anytime I want!

What happened to NFA anyway?  No offence meant, Carnage is doing just as
good  if not better with the Word at the moment, but what happened?  One
minute  I  was reading old ones where NFA were present and then all of a
sudden BANG!  Carnage have landed.  Hmm.

Now on to the reason I'm writing this.....  er, shit, what was it again?
Wait,  wait,  here  it  comes....  oh yeah!  How can I send you articles
over  the  internet?   Do  I just E-Mail them to you or what?  I want to
contribute  to what I reckon is the coolest Disk Mag there is and I want
to do it without finding a jiffy bag for my disks.  Yeah, that was it.

What  I would really like to do is join Carnage but I don't think I have
the skills to do anything worthwhile.  I've pretty well mastered DPaintV
and  I  can  use  ImageFX to an extent.  I've programmed some very basic
programs  in  QBASIC  and  GWBASIC on my very old computer that I nicked
from  my  Dad's  work.   I've  experimented  with  AREXX  mostly through
tutorials  in  CU  Amiga, and I had a go at AMOS but I'll be damned if I
can  get  anything  to  work  with that thing...  I can type fast and do
written  stuff  and  I've  done  some  ascii art, but whether it's up to
standard I just don't know.

I  have  an  A1200  with 6Mb RAM, a 1.7 Gb Hard Drive (nowhere near even
half  full yet) a second disk drive and some stains on the case.  I know
my  Amiga inside-out, and there's nothing that goes on that I don't know
about.  I guess I'm just an expert....  :)

I also have a P166 16Mb RAM 1.2Gb HD 8x CD-ROM drive which I use for the
internet  and  sending  messages  to people with silly names that create
damn  fine disk mags!  I don't know my PeeCee as well as I know my Amiga
-  there's  just  too  much  that  goes on behind my back.  Bastard Bill
Gates...

If  there  is anything I can do to contribute to the running of the Word
or  any other so-called Amiga 'Scene' stuff then drop me a line or seven
at:  jayay@usa.net

I'd  better  go  and  see if I can finish that damned questionnaire now.
Why did you make it so LONG?  Grrrrrrrrrr.

 Dear jAyaY

 Thnks  for  the kind comments.  This issue is kind of a hack I did from
issue  15  as I only had 3 days to do it in and no one had sent anything
(from  the  group)  previously.   This issues menu bar had to be changed
because  I  made  the  mistake  of  putting  the  number "15" in it thus
limiting  it's  use.   This  time around I "borrowed" part of the colour
version  of  Andy  Bolt's  skull picture and pasted my buttons on it.  I
like  it  but I'm sure I'll find out everyone elses opinion soon enough.
;)
 Regarding  NFA,  they  changed  their  name (I believe) and Mike Carter
(Buddha)  is  still  running it.  In fact, if Mike's reading this, could
you email me?
 Carnage  have actually been around as long as NFA but we have only been
called  Carnage  since  1994.   Before that it was Cyberdreams.  You can
find our pre-Carnage releases on most Amiga CDROMs.
 I've  probably  replied to you via email already but for everyone elses
benefit..   just  send us examples of your work if you wish to join.  We
are  into  everything  computer related these days and we are a friendly
bunch  of  guys so you will probably encounter someone in the group with
similar  interests  to  you.  We have an internal communications network
and  we  offer our members friendship, fun, parties and info on stuff to
make life more fun/easy/cheaper.  ;) At present we are 80% Amiga and 20%
PC  with  50% of those members owning a PSX or N64.  70% of us are wired
to  the  Net.  We are supposed to be 100% legal but some of us come from
dubious backgrounds so you never know what you'll learn from us.  ;)))
 As  for  contributing  to  the  Word..   articles,  clipart, web space,
articles,  PT-modules, articles, images, articles, group news, articles,
group news and yep..  more articles!

 Kei.. Re: Competition in The Word

Good  idea,  especially  if  you  can find a company willing to donate a
prize,  even  at half cost as opposed to free.  I think that we can have
small  prizes  now,  say  a  competition  every  two issues?  I am quite
prepared  to  donate  a small prize, I will buy a PC mouse from Dixons -
about  8  quid  - and offer that in one, as long as someone else donates
one  two  issues  later  and  we  work towards getting bigger and better
prizes once the readership goes up.

If  there  are  just three of us, one small prize every six months isn't
going  to  stretch  anyone is it?  At that rate we can start giving away
whole  new  commercial  games without being out of pocket.  It is a good
idea  and  if  we set an example it will be easier to get companies more
interested,  readership  needs  to go up and I agree that prizes are the
way to go.

BTW,  the mouse example is just something I thought of off the top of my
head,  I  was  thinking  about  a  prize  to the value of about 20 quid,
ideally  it  would need to be usable on Amiga and PC, so perhaps a mouse
for  each  of them?  Anyway, the first competition will be in issue 17 -
write  an article for 16 telling people, no-one associated with The Word
or Carnage can enter etc, the competition can be art, music, articles or
whatever.

Competition idea, make a HOT TOPIC and award the prize to whoever writes
the best article for it in the next issue.  So, you say the hot topic is
"PC v Amiga" (or whatever) in issue 17, and publish the articles in 18 &amp;
award  the  prize, the announce another in 19, award the prize in 20 etc
etc etc, it would work quite well, AND get more articles in.

Competition Topics: Set Top Boxes
                    Internet Censorship
                    Computers on TV

and  so on, make then really INTERESTING topics, not shit like Digi, who
ask "Would you pay for Digitiser?", load of shite!

  You  put  it  into  words  better  than  I  could so I basically did a
cut-n-paste  job on your email.  Hope you don't mind?  It's a great idea
so  lets  sit  back  and see what the response is like from the readers.

 Hi!

   Having  spent  quite  a  bit of time (4 years) tied down to one Amiga
disk  mag,  I'm  expanding and getting into lots of others now.  I'm not
saying  which  diskmag I own, but it's out there on magazine CD-ROMs and
the  net  and PD libs.  So you may come across it, but no mention of the
'competition'  here.   (even  though  I do VERY little on it these days,
it's left to my assistant :)

 So  I'm  entering  the  'Scene, which is a part of the Amiga world I've
never  been  'up'  with.   I've  seen  some issues of THE WORD from it's
earlier  days, and I like the approach of "say what you want".  And talk
about nothing :) So I'm going to try and become a 'regular' for THE WORD
with any luck.  Good to see it's back.

 Dear Dan,

  I wish I had more time to write for other magazines. I used to write
for a pulp magazine called "Miracle" which I miss plus other UK based
diskmags like Visual Intensity and Grapevine which are sadly no more.
I'm about to start writing cyberpunk stories as that's the sort of world
I inhabit these days. I know which mag you write for and I'm glad you
want to help with The Word. Some people are probably sitting in their
house reading this right now wanting to reply but thinking they are not
good enough. You are! If you have something to say then say it!
 I  can't  see  myself selling my Amiga so the Word will last as long as
there are readers to support it.  Maybe if someone started voting for it
in  the  international  charts  it may cause more foreign readers to say
"What is this mag?  Anyone have a copy" and from there..  who knows?
 You  don't  need to be on any of the computer scenes or to be part of a
group  to  read  the  Word.   You  just  need to have a computer and the
ability to type.

 Righty  ho then.  One slightly used hamster.  I'll have to open the lid
of  my  486  to  get  it for you.  I'm afraid the turbo button no longer
