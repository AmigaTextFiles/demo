In  The  Word #10 (or #11), I wrote an article about a brand-new diskmag
creator  that was coming out, but due to me over-writing the source code
files  by accident (also, the main article selection routine wasn't done
- as I didn't know how to do it at the time).
<font color =#C4FFC4>
Well,  here  comes to 100% re-written version that has far more features
than  the diskmag creators that are currently out.  BlitzAMC is probably
the best diskmag creator on any computer platform.
<font color =#B8FFC4>
At  the  time  of typing, BlitzAMC is about 75% complete and it is being
constantly worked on.
<font color =#ACFFC4>
This  file contains aditional information to the BlitzAMC advert (in the
IFF Adverts section).
<font color =#B8B8B8>
                                --------
<font color =#FFFFFF>
BlitzAMC comes with (at the time of typing) ....
<font color =#FFF4FF>
 IndexCreator.   This  program  lets  you easily create the main article
 index memu, as well as set the preferences for the main magazine engine
 (loading/main modules, background/panel gfx, intro pics, etc).
<font color =#FFE8FF>
 Article Tester.   This lets you test articles (also displays clipart as
 well as  some other things), edit them, indent/un-indent text.  You can
 also create the article's palette within this program.  Also does other
 things regarding articles.
<font color =#FFDCFF>
 Encrypter.  This  lets  you  encrypt ALL the files that have to do with
 BlitzAMC.  For  example,  you  can  encrypt the background/panel/intro/
 pictures as well as the articles and modules.  Anything, infact.
<font color =#FFD0FF>
 ClipCompiler.  This  lets  you take ordinary IFF pictures and turn them
 into   a   single   file(s)   so  you  can  include  clipart  into your
 articles/index menu.  Upto 256 colour clipart is supported.
<font color =#FFC4FF>
 Unknown Title. This will check to see if all files are in their correct
 places, as well as some other miscellneous things.

<font color =#FFFFFF>
ALL  files  can  be  encrypted  and/or crunched with StoneCracker.  Full
internal StoneCracker support.
<font color =#F4FFFF>
Articles can have their own colour palette as well as clipart.  Articles
can  have basic drawing commands embedded in them for things like boxes,
lines, elipses, circles and things.

Full Anim5/Anim7 support.
<font color =#E8FFFF>
Upto  1000  intro screens (from 2 colours upto HAM8 - no interlaced pics
though (not my fault)) with their own delay and fade values.

The  user  can optionally have a loading module playing while things are
being loaded/displayed and upto 5 main selectable modules.  FULL Tracker
(abd clones) supported.
<font color =#DCFFFF>
There's a 4-channel equaliser on the main panel.

Users  can also include their own scroll-text messages because there's a
very sexy scrolltext at the bottom of the screen.  Looks great!
<font color =#D0FFFF>
BlitzAMC  will  also  take advantage of the AGA chipset if found (24-bit
fades, faster/smoother update (x3 fetchmode), etc).
<font color =#C4FFFF>
2  type of clock in the titlebar.  A standard timer clock that shows you
how long the mag has been loaded for.  And a normal clock that reads the
system time and displays it.
<font color =#B8FFFF>
Full keyboard support.

All docs in AmigaGuide format using textstyles/colour codes.

You  also get a 2nd disk containing more panel/background gfx as well as
intro/main modules, plus lots more.
<font color =#B8F4E8>
OS v2.04 required and probably 1Mb minium.

<font color =#B8B8B8>
                                --------
<font color =#FFFFFF>
There's  still  a  load  of (un-decided) features to implement.  So, how
much  will  all  this  cost?   Only  £5!   (plus  50p  p&amp;p)  It'll be F1
Licenceware,  thus  it can be bought from F1 themselves or directly from
me.  Demo version out soon.
