<font color =#707058>                               By Kei/Crn

The  WORD  is  an  e-Zine  for  anyone.   NFA  set  out with the goal of
producing  an  internal  disk  magazine  for  themselves but after their
contacts started getting their say on it's contents, by issue 5 it was a
regular PD release.

Carnage  got  involved  through my friendship with Dick (aka Freak).  We
were  planning  our  own  diskmag  "SMU" (working title) but we ended up
helping out on The WORD and now we are doing it!

Carnage are a group of computer enthusiasts who own quite a few makes of
computer but we each cut our teeth on the Amiga scene and we consider it
our  home.   We  are  not  an  "elite" demo/trader group but we consider
ourselves to be "part" of the UK Amiga scene.  We get together more than
the  average  scene group even though we live far apart from each other.
We  call  these get-togethers "Gathering's" and so far there have been 9
over  the  last  3 years.  We use these few days to discuss Carnage, the
Amiga  scene,  Carnage  releases  and  what to do next.  A major current
topic is "The WORD" and how we can improve it.

There  are  loads  of  glossy disk magazines out there that take so much
effort  that they barely survive past issue 2.  We in Carnage don't want
that  to  happen  to  The  WORD so we aim to keep it going as long as we
receive  your support.  In return for your precious support we pledge to
maintain  and update the WORD engine, edit articles, provide great music
modules and imagery.

So you know where WE are coming from.  Here's what we need from you:

 The  WORD is divided into sections.  I suppose this makes it easier for
us to clarify which section a particular article should fall under.  You
don't  have to write an article to suit us though.  We want you to write
whatever  YOU  are  interested  in  writing about.  I find that the best
articles  are by those who are really interested in the subject they are
writing about.

 Don't  feel  like you have to churn out a stack of articles though.  If
we  get too many good articles and we lack the space to include them all
then  we'll  include them in the next issue.  We are happy if we receive
one  article  from  a  reader that straight away, you can tell they have
thought about what they are writing.

 I write a lot, I have to for university.  What I tend to do though is I
keep  a piece of paper next to my monitor and when I suddenly think of a
good  topic for an article, I pencil a rough article header and synopsis
down  on the piece of paper.  That way when I do sit down in front of my
computer and start to type..  I have a clear idea of what I want to say.
 We will readily admit that our readership is male.  This is not because
of  the content of this diskmag but due to the amount of ladies that use
an  Amiga.   Although I chat via computer to many a female computer user
everyday  (IRC),  they  all own PC's and have no idea what a "scene" is.
Therefore  The  WORD  will  come  across  to  the average user as a male
publication.

 What  can  you  write about?  Well articles like "My name is Jeremy and
I'd  like  to tell you about my first sexual experience.." is not top of
our list, besides, Dave Diamond has cornered the market!
 The  Amiga scene is in a lull at present but we at Carnage and you, the
reader  are still here with an underated piece of kit in front of us, so
let's use it!

 The  computer scene is changing every day so articles on new technology
and  life  in  general  are  ok.  We will include any news on the scene.
This includes software reviews, group news, parties, rumours and general
info.   Just  as  long  as  they  have not already been aired in another
magazine already.
 UFO  conspiracies  and  the  paranomal  are  also popular topics, as is
bizzare  stories  and the adult section.  Reviews of films and music are
also  appreciated.   Internet  topics  are also accepted.  Start a topic
thread  on anything from surfing the net, hacking, satellite TV, people,
places, nostalgia, football, cyberpunk, books or hamsters.
 Whatever  you want to talk about is ok with us.  Although we do reserve
the  right to refuse an article on the grounds that it discusess a topic
that we think should not be aired in The WORD.  I've only had to do this
once recently for an article submitted for the adult section.
 Ideas  on  how  to improve the WORD are greatly received and discussed.
If  you  think  the  WORD  isn't up to much then tell us why!  Don't say
"..because it's coded in AMOS" though.  The engine was handed over to us
in  this  format  so we have to work with it.  We did consider using our
WIP  diskmag  engine  but we figured such a complete change of interface
might  annoy  the  present  readers.   If you want us to change the WORD
completly  then  tell  us.  Untill we get a huge enough response we will
continue  modifying  Dick's engine.

Got  a  question  for  the Word staff?  Hard drive won't work, your 1200
won't  run  certain  software or your satellite system can't receive 1D?
Then  write  in  to  the  Q  &amp;  A forum and we'll attempt to answer your
question or find someone who can!

<font color =#70584C></PRE><CENTER><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=5><B><I>Adverts</CENTER></FONT></B></I><PRE>


<font color =#4C704C>
We  will  include any articles sent to us that are by people looking for
new  contacts  or  to sell/buy stuff.  Images and texts are ok.  You can
advertise your BBS or Web Site as well.



 It's raining outside.  The chicken burgers are in the microwave and the
pepsi's  chilled..   Hit  that  power  switch,  surf  workbench  and let
inspiration flow through your fingers...
