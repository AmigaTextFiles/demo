PART TWO

         (NOTE: There are TWO methods of going about Part Two)

Method One

You  are now in control of the movements of one Dino Fagoli, an ex-boxer
of  Italian  origin  who is a bit short on brain cells to say the least!
You  start off on a wharf of a small town, but what do you do?  Firstly,
leave  the  wharf  and  head  for  the drugstore, opposite the circus in
Circus  Square.   Go over to the shelves and purchase a can of beans and
then  eat  them.   This will make Dino feel lively so go into the Circus
and  enter  the  weightlifting competition.  Do this by walking straight
into  the  tent  and  getting stooped by the Ringmaster.  Ask him who he
thinks he is and he will announce that "We have a volunteer to challenge
Big Ursus in Weightlifting".  Dino will then go inside the tent and lift
the same weight as the champion to win 100 Rouble dollars!

Now  go  to  the drugstore and purchase a casket of rum and the headache
pills.   Head  back to the wharf and enter the Inn.  Pick up the tankard
and  give  it to the Landlord and he will fill it with water.  Leave the
Inn  and  go back to Circus Square and enter Zelda's cabin.  Talk to her
about your future.  Madam Zelda will tell you that she visualises a land
scorched  by the sun, a man on a horse and hidden treasure.  She will go
on  to  see  two  strangers  named Alex and Kos, telling you your future
depends on them!

Zelda  will  now  leave the room, so take the opportunity to talk to the
parrot  on  the  perch  who will ask you for some sunflower seeds.  Then
exit.   Head  back to the wharf, combine the headache pills with the jug
of  water  and give the mixture to the drunk.  Now talk to the drunk and
ask  him about his box.  It will turn out to contain sunflower seeds and
the drunk is willing to swap his box for a cask of rum.

Swap  the  rum  for  the box and then pick up the box and open it.  It's
full  of  seeds.   Go  back  to  Zelda's cabin and give the seeds to the
parrot.   The  parrot will then have an argument with his female partner
and  quickly  leave  her to go with you, saying married life didn't suit
him.  Before leaving, pick up the skull and the potion.

Head back to the Inn and show the parrot to the old sea dog sitting near
the  door.   The  old dog turns out to be a captain who was the original
owner  of  the parrot.  The captain asks how he can repay you so ask him
about  the  route  of the oil tanker Potemkin and when it is next due to
dock here.

The captain will tell you but don't rush him; take time out to listen to
his  old  tales  of  a life on the high seas.  He will then tell you the
ship is heading for Stokafisburg, about 60 miles from the Inn.  You find
out  that  there is a ship going to Stokafisburg named the Santa Rosalia
and  that  the  captain  is  a good friend of the old sea dog named Vito
Corallo.

However,  the  Santa  Rosalia  will be unable to reach the next port for
about  a  week,  which is far too long for you so you'll have to find an
alternative route.  Walk over to the innkeeper and ask him how to get to
Stokasfisburg.   He  will  tell  you to go on the Orient Express line at
Zerograd,  a  small town just up the road.  Leave the Inn and proceed to
the crossroads, which are beyond the circus.

At  the  crossroads,  go  straight  on towards the woods and enter them.
Head  for  the  dark  wood and turn into the channel that leads into the
distance.   You  will now arrive at a sign with a wasps nest to the left
of  it.   Select  your  lollipop and show it to the nest of wasps.  They
will  then  chase  you  to  a nearby cave.  When you arrive at the cave,
throw  the lollipop inside so that the wasps fly in after it.  This will
then  get  rid  of  the pair of wolves inside, allowing you to go safely
into the cave yourself.

The  cave  will  lead  to another part of the woods, so you can continue
onward  until  you  reach  the town of Zerograd.  You will arrive at the
train station in the centre of town.  Firstly, pick up the poster on the
wall and then go into the luggage office and show the poster to the ape.
This  will  make  the ape throw a banana at you.  Pick up the banana and
then talk to Miss Molatova's bodyguard back on the platform.  He will be
extremely rude, so eat the banana allowing the skin to drop to the floor
and  then talk to Miss Molatova.  The bodyguard will then try to hit you
but  he  will  slip  on  the banana skin.  The bodyguard breaks his leg,
leaving  a vacancy which you step into by talking to Miss Molatova.  She
will  ask you to escort her to Venice and you will now be able to get on
board the train.

Method Two

Although this is much the same as method one, there are some differences
along the way, so read on to find out more....

Go  inside  the  Inn  and  pick  up  the jug, give it to the landlord to
receive  some  water.   Examine  the wine list and talk to the innkeeper
about  wine.   Buy the goldengrape and, when he disappears, take all the
items  off the walls.  Now head for the drugstore opposite the circus in
Circus  Square.   Go over to the shelves and purchase a can of beans and
eat  them.   This  will  make Dino feel lively so go into the circus and
enter  the  weightlifting  competition as described in method one to win
100  Rouble  dollars.   Now go to the Drugstore and purchase a casket of
rum.

Next,  go  back to Circus Square and enter Zelda's cabin and talk to her
about your future.  Madam Zelda will tell you that she visualises a land
scorched  by  the  sun,  a man on a horse and hidden treasure.  She will
continue to see two strangers named Alex and Kos, your future depends on
them.  Zelda will now leave the room, so take the opportunity to examine
the  headache  potion  and  combine  the ingredients together.  Give the
headache  potion  to the drunk.  Now talk to the drunk and ask him about
his  box.   It  will  turn  out that it contains sunflower seeds and the
drunk would be willing to swap his box for a cask of rum.

Swap the rum for the box, pick up the box and open it.  You will find it
full of seeds.  Take the seeds to the parrot in Zelda's caravan and then
take  the  parrot  along  with  you.  Proceed to the Inn and reunite the
parrot  with the old sea dog and then go to the sword-swallower and talk
to  him.   When he swallows his sword, pick up another from the front of
the  stall.  Now go to the crossroads and head to the lake.  Pick up all
the  items  from  the snowman and use the sword on the ice.  Combine the
broom  and  the  pendant  and  use it in the hole.  You will now catch a
fish,  so  take  it back to the wharf and show it to the cat.  Then take
the  cat  into the Inn and show it to the dog.  Now you can grab another
sword and combine the swords with the box to make a sledge.

Go to the frozen lake again and sledge across it to reach Zerograd.  You
will eventually arrive at the train station in the centre of town.  Pick
up  the  poster on the wall and then go into the luggage office and show
the  poster  to  the ape.  This will make the ape throw a banana at you.
Pick  up  the  banana and then talk to Miss Molatova's bodyguard back on
the  platform.   The bodyguard will be extremely rude, so eat the banana
allowing  the  skin to drop to the floor and then talk to Miss Molatova.
The  bodyguard  will  then  try  to hit you but he'll slip on the banana
skin.   The bodyguard will break his leg, leaving a vacancy that you can
step  into  by talking to Miss Molatova.  She will ask you to escort her
to Venice and you will now be able to get on board the train.
