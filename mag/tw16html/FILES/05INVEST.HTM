                   --------------------------------
<font color =#FFD0B8>
Got  a few quid mounting up?  Here's a few ideas about savings you might
want to consider..  First some info on TAX.

TAX - Net &amp; Gross
-----------------

Unless  specifically stated, all interest payments from savings accounts
are  taxable.   If you dont pay tax because your earnings (including any
interest) are below your personal allowance (currently around £4000 for=
a  single person) then you are entitled to have interest paid "GROSS" to
your  account  IE:   untaxed  (you just fill out a special form when you
open  an  account).  Everyone else who pays tax on their earnings at the
lower  rates  (ie:   under 40%), receives their interest "NET" IE:  Less
20% tax.

Bank Accounts
-------------

Banks  tend to pay the worst interest rates on savings.  I find its best
to  use  banks  to  your  advantage  by  getting a instant access cheque
account  and  then  keep  the  bare  minimum of cash in there - put your
serious  money elsewhere!  The TBS's interest-cheque account for example
gives  you cheque book, cash card, direct debit facilities and also pays
token  interest  (about  1%!).  Also you'll soon be sent credit card and
phone banking applications.

The  very  good  account at the moment is run by Sainsbury's.  It can be
opened with as little as £1 and offers telephone banking, Link cash card
etc whilst still paying around 5% net on your savings.

Building Societies
------------------

Something of a dying breed what with all the take-overs and windfalls of
late!   Still,  building  societies  do  tend  to  have  a more relaxed,
personal  approach  to  their  clients.   They also tend to offer better
rates  and a wide range of accounts, such as TESSAs, bonds, etc.  Having
said that, if you do have a building society account its best to keep an
eye  on the interest rate paid on your account - building societies have
a  habit  of  dropping  interest  rates  dramatically  on  old accounts,
sometimes so badly that its hardly worth being in there.

Postal  accounts  can  be  quite  convenient  - offering slightly better
rates,  a  cash  card  for  withdrawals  from any Link cash machine, and
freepost  envelopes  etc.   Investments  are limited to cheques however,
sending cash is a no-no.

Types of account:
-----------------

TESSA
-----
Tax  exempt  savings  account.   Original  Tessas  have  now matured and
"second  generation  tessas"  are  now  available.   The rules are quite
simple,  you  can  invest  up  to  £9000  over 5 years, and the interest
generated  in  paid  tax free.  You can withdraw but there are penalties
such as losing your tax exemption bonus.  Currently paying around 7% per
year.

Bonds
-----
Many  types  but  normally  you invest "x" amount of cash and it is then
tied-up  for  "y"  years  &amp;  generally  for investments over £1000.  You
cannot add to it and you cannot withdraw until it matures.  The interest
offered  varies  from day to day, but is usually then fixed for the life
of  your bond.  Interest may be paid monthly or yearly and is subject to
Tax  if  you  are  a  tax  payer.  "Escalator bonds" are sometimes quite
attractive:  the interest rate increases each year.

National Savings
----------------
Various  schemes  run  by  the  government, (operated by mail) sometimes
offering  quite  decent  rates.   "Income bonds" pay monthly interest on
your  savings and only require 30 days notice for withdrawal.  Rates are
constanlty varying and tax is payable.

Premium Bonds
-------------
Just  like  the national lottery really, except the draw is once a month
and  you  never lose the money you put in!  Obviously unless you win you
never  get  any  "interest"  on  your  money  either!   But with savings
accounts  offering  rates  lower  than  inflation  for savings less than
£1000,  theres  not much to lose!  Minimum "investment" is £100, maximum
is  £20,000.   There  are  loads  of  prizes  other  than the £1,000,000
jackpot.  £50,000s, £25,000s £10,000s £5,000s etc.  Winners are notified
by  mail  (and  winning numbers are published on teletext).  You can ask
for  some  / all of your investment back at any time.  Application forms
at the post office.

PEPs
----
Personal  Equity Plan.  Recently, with the low interest rates offered by
traditional  bank  /  building  society accounts these TAX FREE accounts
have been a real winner - Doubling original investments over 5 years has
not  been uncommon.  These are offered by insurance companies as well as
some  banks  / building societies.  The money you invest (up to £6000 in
any  one  tax  year) is put into a fund with everyone elses and invested
across a wide range of stocks and shares, managed by the company running
the  PEP.   This  way, any losses should be countered by growth in other
sectors  -  PEPs are not guarenteed however, there is some risk involved
and  should  be  viewed  a  middle  to  long term investment (5 years at
least.) PEPs are available several guises, EG:  "Growth" concentrates on
increasing  your  capital,  "Income"  pays  a  monthly  income  on  your
investment.  It should be said that the future is somewhat uncertain for
PEPs  as  the  government  is  considering  proposals for a new personal
investment plan which will probably replace them.

Current Info

Apart  from  trawling the high street / internet some info on the latest
offers  etc  can be found on page 540 on channel 4 teletext and page 250
on BBC2.


<font color =#FFFF4C>[It  would  be  interesting  to  see  some reviews on Banks and Building
Society's  as  I for one am looking into a bank account with a different
bank.   How  about  some  readers  telling  us  about their bank and the
service it offers it's customers?  Kei]
