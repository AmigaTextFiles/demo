@node BUR "Burnout"

I declare I don't care no more
I'm burning up and out and growing BORED
In my smoked out BORING room
My hair is shagging in my eyes
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
To drive along these shit town lights

I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
to walk amongst the DEAD

A pathy has rained on me
Now I'm feeling like a soggy dream
So close to drowning but I DON'T MIND
I've lived inside this mental cave
Throw my emotions in the grave
HELL,who needs them anyway

I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
to walk amongst the DEAD

(Repeat many times)

@node HAV "Having a Blast"

I'm taking all you down with me
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothings gonna change my mind

I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothing left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway

No one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've ment
To me its nothing...

I'm losing all my happiness
The happiness YOU pinned on me
Loneliness still comforts me

My anger DWELLS inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you
And all the shit you put me through

No one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've ment
To me its nothing...

Do you ever thing back to another time?
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost you're mind?
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
and mow down any BULLSHIT that comfronts you?
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head?
To make one problem that adds up to NOTHING
To me its nothing...

@node CHU "Chump"

I don't know you
But,I think I HATE you
You're the reason for my misery
Strange how you've become
my biggest enemy
And I've never even seen your face

Maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a VIOLENT mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much SENSE
Or maybe I'm just DUMB

You're the cloud hanging out over my head
Hail comes crashing down
welting my face
MAGIC MAN,EGOCENTRIC PLASTIC MAN
Yet you still get one over on me

Maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a VIOLENT mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much SENSE
Or maybe I'm just DUMB

@node LON "Longview"

Sit around and watch the tube,but nothing's on
Change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fucking lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored I'm going BLIND!!!
And I smell like shit

Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a DOG IN HEAT
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to MY OWN CELL
And I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored I'm going BLIND!!!
And I smell like shit

I GOT NO MOTIVATION
WHERE IS MY MOTIVATION
NO TIME FOR THE MOTIVATION
SMOKING MY INSPIRATION

Sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me WHAT YOU WILL
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one SHE'S got
When masturbation's lost its fun
You're fucking breaking

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn BORED
I'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice
Bite my lip and close my eyes
I was slipping away to paradise
Some say,"Quit or I'll go BLIND."
But it's just a myth

Dear mother,
Can you hear me whining?
It's been three whole weeks
Since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feeling so alone

Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it the slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through
a wasteland I like to call
my home
Welcome To Paradise

A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through
a wasteland I like to call

Welcome To Paradise

Dear mother,
Can you hear me laughing
It's been six whole months since
Since that I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home

Some call it the slums

to listen to me whine
About NOTHING and EVERYTHING

Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm CRACKING UP
Am I just PARANOID?
Or am I just STONED

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
SHE says it's lack of sex
that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
HE said my life's a bore
So quit my whining cause
it's bringing HER down

Sometimes I give myself the CREEPS
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up

Uh, yuh, yuh, ya

Grasping to CONTROL

You've been searching for that someone,
and it's me out on the prowl

As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Don't get lonely now
Dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment

Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight
you been thinking about ditching me
No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
to try and slag me down because I know I'm right

So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your selfdoubt means nothing
was ever there

You can't go forcing something if it's just
not right

No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Or a bullet in my face
To hell with unity

Torn to shreds and disjointed

All of her favorite things
Sold the rest at a rainy yard sale
Big plans and leaving friends and
A westbound sign
Weighed out
Her choices on a scale
Prevailing nothing made sense
Just transportation and a
Blank decision... 

She's taking off
Taking off...
Taking off...
Taking off...

No time and no copping out
She's burning daylight and petrol
Blacked out the rearview mirror
Heading westward on
Strung out
On confusion road
And ten minute nervous breakdowns
Xanex a beer for thought
And she determined... 

She's taking off
Taking off...
Taking off...
Taking off...

Is it salvation?
Or an escape from discontent?
Will she find her name
In the California cement?
Punched out of the grind
That punched her one too many times...
Is tragedy 2000 miles away?

She's taking off
Taking off...

I'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right

Do as I say not as I do because
The shit so deep you can't run away
I beg to differ on the contrary
I agree with every word that you say
Talk is cheap and lies are expensive
My wallet's fat and so is my head
Hit and run and then I'll hit you again
I'm a smart ass but I'm playing dumb

I have no belief
But I believe
I'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right

I have no belief
But I believe
I'm a walking contradiction
And I ain't got no right

@node NIC "Nice Guys Finish Last"

Nice guys finish last.
You're running out of gas.
Your sympathy will get you left behind.
Sometimes you're at your best, when you look the worst.
Do you feel washed up, like piss going down the drain

Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane.
I'm so fucking happy I could cry.
Every joke can have its truth and now the joke's on you.
I never knew you were such a funny guy.

Oh nice guys finish last, when you are the outcast.
Don't pat yourself on the back, you might break your spine.

Living on command.
You're shaking lots of hands.
Kissing up and bleeding all your trust, taking what you need.
Bit the hand that feeds.
You kill your memory
@endnode

@node HIT "Hitchin' A Ride"

Hey mister, where you headed?
Are you in a hurry?
I need a lift to happy hour.
Say oh no.
Do you brake for distilled spirits?
I need a break as well.
The well that inebriates the guilt.
1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4.

Cold turkey's getting stale, tonight I'm eating crow. 
Fermented salmonella poison oak no 

There's a drought at the fountain of youth, and now I'm dehydrating.
My tongue is swelling up, as say 1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. 
Troubled times, you know i can not lie. 
I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride. 

There's a drought at the fountain of youth, and now I'm dehydrating. 
My tongue is swelling up, I say Shit! 
@endnode

@node GRO "The Grouch"

I was a young boy that had big plans.
Now I'm just another shitty old man. 
I don't have fun and I hate everything. 
The world owes me, so fuck you. 

Glory days don't mean shit to me. 
I drank a six pack of apathy. 
Life's a bitch and so am I. 
The world owes me, so fuck you. 

Wasted youth and a fustful of ideals. 
I had a young and optimisitic point of view. 
Wasted youth and a fustful of ideals.
I had a young and optimisitic point of view. 

I've decomposed, yet my gut's getting fat. 
Oh my god I'm turning out like my dad. 
I'm just a grouch sitting on the couch. 
The world owes me, so fuck you. 

The wife's a nag and the kid's fucking up.
I don't have sex `cause i can't get it up.
I'm always rude.
I've got a bad attitude.
The world owes, so fuck you.
@endnode

@node RED "Redundant"

We're living in repetition.
Content in the same old shtick again.
Now the routine's turning to contention,
Like a production line going over and over and over, roller coaster.

Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice.
I'm speechless and redundant.
'Cause I love you's not enough.
I'm lost for words.

Choreographed and lack of passion.
Prototypes of what we were.
Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous.
Taken for granted now.
Now I waste it, faked it, ate it, now i hate it.

Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice.
I'm speechless and redundant, 'cause I love you's not enough.
I'm lost for words, now I cannot speak.
@endnode

@node SCA "Scattered"

I've got some scattered pictures lying on my bedroom floor.
Reminds me of the times we shared.
Makes me wish that you were here.
Now it seems I've forgotten my purpose in this life.
All the songs have been erased.
Guess I've learned from my mistakes.

Open the past and present.
Now and we are there.
Story to tell and I am listening.
Open the past and present.
And the future too.
It's all I've got and I'm giving it up to you.

Loose ends tied in knots.
Leaving a lump down in my throat.
Gagging on a souvenir.
Lodged to fill another year.
Drag it on and on until my skin is ripped to shreds.
Leaving myself wide open.
Living out a sacrifice.

If you got no one and I've got no place to go, would it be alright?
Could it be alright?
@endnode

@node TIM "All The Time"

All the time, every time I need it.
What's the time?
I'd say the time is right.
Here's to me.
Let's find another reason.
Down the hatch and a bad attitude.
Salud.

Wasting time
Wasting time down a bum fuck road.
And I don't know where the hell it'll go.
Heirlooms and huffing fumes, and I'm picking up the pace
and I'm gonna smash straight into a wall. 

All the time. 
A "New Year's Resolution" 
How soon that we forget.
Doing time. 
Loving every minute. 
Live it up on another let down. 
Salud. 

Promises, promises, it was all set in stone, cross my heart and hope to die. 
Sugar fix, dirty tricks and a trick question. 
Guess i should have read between the lines.
Having the time of my life, watching the clock tick. 

All the time, where did all the time go? 
It's too late to say goodnight. 
Time flies when you're having fun. 
Time's up when you work like a dog. 
Salud. 
@endnode

@node WRC "Worry Rock"

Another sentimental argument and bitter love.
Fucked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud.
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone. 
The worry rock has turned to dust and fallen on our pride. 

A knocked down dragged out fight. 
Fat lips and open wounds. 
Another wasted night and no one will take the fall. 

Where do we go from here? 
And what did you do with the directions? 
Promise me no dead end streets
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road. 
@endnode

@node PLA "Platypus (I Hate You)"

Your rise and fall
Back up against the wall 
What goes around is coming back and haunting you 
It's time to quit 
Cause you ain't worth the shit
Under my shoes or the piss on the ground 

No one loves you and you know it 
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care 
Cause now I wouldn't lie or tell you all the things you want 
to hear. 

I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU 

I heard your sick 
Sucked on that cancer stick 
A throbbing tumor and a radiation high 
Shit out of luck
And now your time is up 
It brings me pleasure just to know your going to die 

Dickhead, Fuckface, cock smoking, mother fucking, asshole, dirty twat, waste
of semen, I hope you die HEY 

Red eye, code blue 
I'd like to strangle you 
And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull 
When you go down
Head first into the ground
I'll stand above you just to piss on your grave
@endnode

@node UPT "Uptight"

I woke up on the wrong side of the floor.
Made, made my way through the front door.
Broke my engagement with myself.
Perfect picture of bad health, another notch scratched on my belt.
The future just ain't what it used to be.

I got a new start on a dead end road.
Peaked, peaked out on reaching new lows.
Owe, I paid off all my debts to myself.
Perfect picture of bad health, another notch scratched on my belt.
The future's in my living room.

Uptight, I'm a nag with a gun.
All night, suicide's last call.
I've been uptight all night.
I'm a son of a gun.
Uptight I'm a nag with a gun.
@endnode

@node JIN "Jinx"

I fucked up again it's all my fault.
So turn me around and face the wall. 
Read me my rights and tell me I'm wrong. 
Until it gets into my thick skull. 

A slap on the wrist. 
A stab in the back. 
Torture me, I've been a bad boy. 
Nail me to the cross until you have won.
I lost before I did any wrong. 

I'm hexed with regrets and bad luck. 
Keep you distance 'cause it's rubbing off. 
Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell. 
Or earth with me tangled at your feet. 
You finally met you nemesis disguised as your fatal long lost love. 
So kiss it good bye 
Until death do we part. 
You fell for a jinx for crying out loud. 
@endnode

@node HAU "Haushinka"

Haushinka is a girl with a peculiar name.
I met her on the eve of my birthday. 
Did she know, did she know, before she went away, does she know? But it's
too damn late 

This girl has gone far away. 
Now she's gone. 

All I have now is a memory to date.
A cheap hat and cigarettes, and a peculiar name. 
I didn't know, I didn't know, before she went away. 
I know now, I know now, and it's too damn late. 

Will she ever find her way? 
I'm too damn young to be too late, but am I? 
Yet again I'm kicking myself, and I'll be here in battle scars,
Waiting for you.
Waiting for you now. 
@endnode

@node WON "Walking Alone"

Come together like a foot in a shoe
Only this time I think I stuck my foot in my mouth. 
Thinking out loud and acting in vain. 
Knocking over anyone that stands in my way. 

Sometimes I need to apologize. 
Sometimes I need to admit that I ain't right. 
Sometimes I should just keep my mouth shut, or only say hello. 
Sometimes I still feel I'm walking alone. 

Walk on eggshells on my old stomping ground, yet there's really no one left,
that's hanging around. 
Isn't that another familiar face? 
Too drunk to figure out they're fading away. 
@endnode

@node REJ "Reject"

Who the hell are you to tell me what I am
And what's my master plan.
What makes you think that it includes you? 
Self-righteous wealth 
Stop flattering yourself, 'cause when the smoke clears here I am. 
Your reject all-American. 

Sucking up you social sect, making you a nervous wreck. 
To hell and back and hell again I've gone. 
You're not my type. 
Not my type. 

What's the difference between you and me? 
I do what I want, and you do what you're told. 
So listen up and shut the hell up. 
It ain't no big deal.
And I'll see you in hell, 'cause when the smoke clears here I am,
Your reject all-American.

Falling from grace, right on my fave. 
To hell and back and hell again I've gone. 
@endnode

@node BAC "Take Back"

You pushed me once too far again
I'd like to break you fucking teeth. 
Stick a knife in the center of your back. 
You better grow some eyes in the back of your head. 
I fight dirty, just like your looks. 
Can't take, can't take, can't take anymore. 
Take back, Take back, Take. 

The taste of bad blood on the tip of my tongue. 
An eye for an eye. 
Gun for a gun. 

Cold-cocked and I'm taking back what's mine. 
Expect it when you're least expecting it.
No loss of love, the smell of regret. 
Lights out 
Can't take anymore 

Shit 
@endnode

@node KIN "King For A Day"

Started at the age of 4.
My mother went to the grocery store. 
Went sneaking throught her bedroom door to find something in a size 4. 

Sugar and spice and everything nice wasn't made for only girls. 
GI Joe in panty hose is making room for the one and only. 

King for a day, princess by dawn. 
King for a day in a leather thong. 
King for a day, princess by dawn. 
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me. 

My daddy threw me in therapy. 
He thinks I'm not a real man.
Who put the drag in the drag queen. 
Don't knock it until you tried it 
@endnode

@node GRI "Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)"

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road.
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to do. 
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why. 
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time. 

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. 
I hope you had the time of your life. 

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind. 
Hang it on a shelf of good health and good time. 
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial. 
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while. 
I hope you had the time of your life. 

I hope you had the time of your life. 
@endnode

@node PRO "Prosthetic Head"

I see you, down in the front line.
Such a sight for sore eyes, you're a suicide makeover. 
Plastic eyes, lookin' through a numbskull. 
Self-effaced, what's his face. 
You erased yourself so shut up. 
You don't let up. 

You have a growth that must be treated 
Like a severed severe pain in the neck. 
You can smell it but you can't see it. 
No explanation identified 'cause you don't know. 
You don't say. 

And you got no reply. 
Hey you, where did you come from? 
Got a head full of lead, you're a inbred bastard son. 
All dressed up, red blooded, Amannequin 
Do or die, no reply, don't deny that you're synthetic. 
You're pathetic. 
@endnode

@node DES "Desensitized (Japanese Version Only)"

Clenching my teeth tight
My head is like a sponge
Give it to me free
I wanna get ripped off
And drown in the airwaves
Another fatal wreck
On the Information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves
It all amuses me
For I'll be damned to spend
My life in hell
Another wise ingrete

Bring me blood and pain
of a stranger's fate
Give it all away
Gimme gimme now
I'm desensitized
I wanna watch the bomb
Blow the masses high
