			NOTE TO JP5 COMMERCIAL INTRO:

Sorry for low design; I (Modem) coded this intro in 2 days, so i used old
routines instead of the new ones that i'll release in my new demo for the
Euskal party this summer. Sorry also for large memory needed, i didn't found
the time to add a dinamic memory allocation routine, so there's only a standard
cruncher-decruncher inside. I hope you will like the mag, it really rule! Thanx
to Ghandy for this opportunity to code the intro for one of the best mags EVER!
Ah... before i forgot, try to find the hidden part! 8-)
