Three Little Elks  (3LE)
                            (last change: # 15 - april '97)

  ANDROID   -  musician, moral support
  ANT       -  graphician
  COMA      -  musician, swapper
  EXPLORER  -  coder
  NUDE      -  graphician, spiritual leader
  PLUS8     -  raytracer, designer, 3LE merchandise dealer
  SPOT      -  graphician
  TABASCO   -  coder

 - Ant is a doublemember of Spiderboys C64.

 - Ant quit swapping for his C64 business, so Coma is the
   "mail-HQ" of 3LE.

 - Spot and Plus8, both graphicians, joined from New Age.

 - Laz is inactive since he needs to care about his family
   and his PC.

 - Blunt/GHD is the official spreader of 3LE-productions.

 - You haven't seen much of 3LE lately, because the coders
   (all 2 of them) are studying heavily at the technical
   university of Chalmers.
