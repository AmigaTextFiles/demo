To install Rage!, just copy the fonts and libs in appropriate directory 
(if  ever  you did not have them), then copy Rage07.exe and Rage07.Data
in the same directory.

Rage! handles fast Ram now, but it still should work with chipr ram only
machines. Also it now only runs on HD (sorry, for the others but it's time
to support the Amiga and upgrade :-)
