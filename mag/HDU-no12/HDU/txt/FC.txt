FloatingClock v2.10 (BUG FIX from Version 2.0)

============================================

A Simple but very nice workbench clock program. Now tries 
to match a colour specified with the nearest one in the 
workbench palette. The digits are also smaller, but still may 
look a bit out of proportin on low res screen modes. ( c'mon, 
buy a monitor! ).
