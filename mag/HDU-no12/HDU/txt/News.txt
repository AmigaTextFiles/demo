Alive Mediasoft Sign up Samba World Cup
===============================================
I have just received news that Alive Mediasoft, the team behind the 
upcoming Haunted have just secured the rights to publish Samba 
World Cup. You may remember the game from when I brought you 
news on it a couple of weeks ago, back then details were quite low 
and varied, however, I am now able to bring you confirmed details 
on what the game will feature and one thing is for sure, it certainly 
sounds like it could turn out to be one hell of a good game.

Its unusual for the Amiga to be short on football games during a 
tournament as big as the world cup, however, ever since the big 
guns left the Amiga there hasn't actually been a game of any note 
released. The last decent football game we saw was Sensible 
World of Soccer, Samba World Cup is setting some high targets 
and is going out to beat this excellent game. It certainly has a very 
nice feature list to help it on its way and I'm sure you can see from 
the screenshots that it certainly looks the part, all it needs to do 
now is have the gameplay - something that we'll hopefully find out 
in the next fews weeks when a demo is released.

The game is a mixture of both action & management for 1 or 2 
players, the management part of the game is being qouted as 
being very comprehensive, with a massive range of statistics for 
you to look through.  The action part may be where the games 
makes or breaks though, in this you take total control of the team 
and so can actually make the difference unlike other management 
games. This game is going out to succeed where other games that 
have tried this combination of the management and action have 
failed. The game includes six of the best leagues in Europe and 
allows you to play in any of them. These include the English 
Permier League, Serie A, Bunesliga and also the Dutch, French 
and Spanish leagues.  Many cup competitions will also be in the 
game including European Cup, World Cup and many others. The 
action part of the game will take place in variable weather 
conditions, 6 in total and will also include a nice feature that will 
allow you to save highlights from the match allowing you to keep 
that treasured moment of a great goal on disk forever.  The sound 
is not being left out in the dark either with full spoken commentry in 
both English and German (CD Only), this also includes spoken 
player names. The game will be released on CD and Floppy 
formats for both AGA & ECS. Graphics cards will also be 
supported. The minimum spec for the ECS version is any ECS 
Amiga with 1.5Mb RAM, the AGA version requires an 
A1200/A4000 with at least 2.5Mb RAM. The game will be available 
in the first week of July with a demo hopefully being released 
sometime next week.

Amiga Abuse Port Released
===============================================

Finally, an Amiga port of the PC jump 'n run game Abuse has been 
made available. The source to this game was released around the 
same time and Descent and so was pushed out of the limelight 
somewhat. However, now, thanks to the programmers of ADescent 
we can all play it.

For those of you that haven't heard of Abuse, it is a platform game 
very much in the style of Obliterator from Psygnosis, however, it 
has a lot more to offer. The Amiga has been devoid of a decent 
platform game recently and it seems rather ironic that when a good 
one does finally come along it is in the form of a PC port, mainly 
due to the fact that the Amiga has always been considered the best 
platform for games of this type. Abuse was released to the PC 
market around Spring 1996, while it was reasonably popular it 
didn't cause a massive stir in the market.  It is different to many of 
the platform games that we have seen before on the Amiga mainly 
due to fact that it contains a number of features and special effects 
that haven't been seen before in games of this type. The first of 
these is Dynamic Light Effects, probably the last thing you would 
expect to see in a platform game, however, bear in mind that is has 
come from the PC, and they'll use any excuse to get things like this 
in any game, no matter what type it is. For what it matters, it does 
actually look quite good although I'm not sure hoe much it really 
adds to the game. The second (and most interesting, in my 
opinion) is Network play. This allows up to 8 players to play 
eachother in deathmatch mode, sounds something like Quake on 
platforms.  Unfortunalty, I haven't yet tried this, however, I'll let you 
know what its like as soon as I have.As with the other port that was
developed by this team, Abuse uses the RTGMaster Library, due 
to this it is playable on any Amiga (AGA, GFX Card and even ECS 
(although ECS support it slightly limited).

I'll be having a more detailed look at this as soon as I have had 
more time to play it. Currently, the Amiga port is only downloadable 
from the webpage of the authors at :

http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/CIP/tfrieden

To play the game, as well as the main exe files you will need a set 
of data files. Shareware versions of these are downloadable from 
the above webpage.

Corruption Software & Dafel Bloodline Update ( team massage )

First off I would like to thank Amiga Nuttah for its continuing support 
to our project. Without its help we would not have been able to 
gather together our graphical team. Thank you to everyone who 
applied for the job and apologies to those we had to turn down! We 
had nearly 20 requests for the job from all over the world! It just 
shows you how many passionate and professional AMIGA people 
there are out there!

We were originally known as Desktop Corruption Software, but due 
to our initials, (DC) and some confusion with users, we were 
mistaken for a cracking crew of a similar name. For that reason, we 
are now called Corruption Software and everything is still business 
as usual. We would also like to tell everyone that our website 
address has changed and that the link from the Sadeness 
homepage is out of date and has been for some time. You can now 
find us at our perminate web home at http://www.thehub.u-net.com 
Unlike some reports we had back, we have not gone out of 
business or given up on the game!

About Us
Corruption Software was first formed over 2 years ago by some 
passionate Blitz coders from the Blitz List. Our aim was to convert 
PC games over to the AMIGA, but a lack of interest from PC 
companies forced us into doing our own project which we are 
grateful for. From our initial group of 12 users, only 3 of the initial 
Blitz List members are still present with 5 new group members 
making up our graphical and audio team. We are an internet based 
coding group with the net as our office with our employees 
streached out around the world. Our team consists of:

Liz Tucker (England) Group Leader and Head Coder.
Jason "Caradog" Hayman (Wales) Group Leader and 
Designer/Project Manager.
Richard Hodger (Ireland)
Ad Hoc coding and TCP/IP (UDP) Code Basher.
Ben Brosdahl (USA) Manga Animations.
Ruben Monteiro (Portugal) CD music.
Henrik Johansson (Sweden) In-game graphics.
Nick Salt & Curtis Fell (Wales) In-game character animations.

About Dafel : Bloodline
Bloodline is part one of a series of RPG games that we intend to 
create. The game centres around a character named Dafel 
(pronounced Dav-el) and the quests he has to complete. Unlike 
most other RPGs in the past, Bloodline is based upon a written 
story so that we can add to the game a strong storyline that we 
believe you, the gaming public, will enjoy. Without giving too much 
away, the story is based upon Dafel's conflict with his old religion 
and the new religion that is sweaping across his land. Dafel is a 
knight of this new religion (although he used to believe in the old 
religion) and finds out quite harshly that he is being used for evil 
means. You can read the prologue to the game from our website 
that can explain the initial story far better than we can here. It is an 
original story with some typical RPG cliches that we like to throw in 
to add a twists in the tails to keep the player on their toes.

The game also uses our FSG sound system that mixes 
atmospheric CD music to sound effects. Half of the audio channels 
available are reserved for environment samples that change 
dynamical as Dafel investigates his surroundings. For example, if 
Dafel is walking through a woods, then the sounds of birds can be 
heard, if he then walks near a cliff edge, the sound of wind blowing 
appears. The second half of the audio channels have been 
reserved for sound objects. These allow objects and locations to be 
"tagged" to sounds and for that sound to then be play relative to 
Dafel's location on the map. If Dafel hears a bell and he is standing 
to the left of it, then the sound will emerge from the right speaker, 
similarly if Dafel is standing on the opposite side of the object, the 
sound will come from the corresponding speaker. Also, the closer 
Dafel is to the sound, the louder it will be heard. Likewise, the 
further away Dafel is, then the quieter the sound will be head. This 
allows us to add sur ound style sound to the game and also means 
we can can purely sound based puzzles and objects! At present 
only basic Paula sound is supported, but in the near future we hope 
to add support for AHI.

Technical Specifications
Processor: 68030+. The faster, the better the game will run. 
Memory : AGA version - 2meg Chip/4-6meg Fast (320x256), RTG 
version - 4meg 
Chip/4-6meg Fast (640x400 est).
CD-ROM: (SCSI/IDE) 2x or better.
Hard drive: 40meg aprrox. free space to store data files to allow 
CD-ROM music to play uninterrupted.
Audio: It is recommended that you have your AMIGA hooked up to 
a good stereo/amplifier/headphone socket for the FSG Sound 
Objects to be heard correctly.

All in-game animations have been 3D modelled while we have kept 
all in-game graphics drawn traditionally by hand. All graphics have 
been rendered/drawn in 256 colours and are stored and rendered 
to the screen from Fast memory breaking the AGA 2meg Chip 
barrier. All graphics are also rendered to the screen by the CPU 
and not the blitter.

We will post a pre-demo on our website very soon.  Again, that 
website is : http://www.thehub.u-net.com
