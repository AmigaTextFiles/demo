More Lambda Screenshots
Yet more screenshots of Lambda have been released as as is the 
norm they continue to look better and better each time. Even 
though coding of the game has stopped for a while (due to the 
coder working on a demo production) new features have still been 
added. One of these features is the inclusion of ships having 'vital 
systems'. For example, the bridge structure could be destroyed 
thus disabling maneuverability, gun turrents can be destroyed to 
stop them shooting you etc. For the latest information on Lambda 
keep an eye on the official website at :

Z for Amiga from clickBOOM?

News on Z being ported the the Amiga was brought to you on 
these pages just a few weeks ago. Well, there has now been 
another twist to this news. The Z logo has now appeared on the 
clickBOOM site, this and the mentio of it on the PXL Computers 
site very much points to them taking some part in the publishing of
the title. This is yet to be comfirmed by clickBOOM themselves and 
I doubt that if it is the fact that an official announcment will be made 
before the release of Napalm.

Wasted Dreams Out Soon

Wasted Dreams, the long awaited adventure/action game from 
Vulcan is finally approaching release. If all goes to plan to should 
be released on CD-ROM format at the end of July.

Gilbert Goodmate Update

The development of Gilbert Goodmate has changed slightly. The 
developers have now decided to also do a PC version of the game, 
this will probably be released before the Amiga verison although 
there is a chance both will be released at the same time. More info 
on this soon.

Virtual GP
I'm sure many of you will be glad to know that development of this 
game is still going along nicely. The author is currently in the 
process of constructing the tracks. Other changes that have been 
made to the game includes the addition of a new resolution 
(320x512), support for GFX boards and maybe PPC support...

Ultra Violent Worlds.
===============================================

You may remember this game from when I wrote an article about 
it. This was quite a long time ago now and even I thought that the 
game had gone the way of many of the other planned Amiga 
games, however, I'm pleased to say that I have been proved 
wrong, the game has now actually been finished and is available 
directly from the authors. 

For those of you that don't remember, Ultra Violent Worlds is a 2D 
vertical shoot-em-up is the old style of Xenon 2 and the like, 
however, it has advanced on them in many departments, 
especially the graphics. The Amiga has been devoid of this type 
of game for a very long time, a type of game that was once 
commenly available and something the Amiga was renowned for.

Ultra Violent Worlds promices fast and hectic action and from 
what I have seen of the demo it certainly delivers, the game 
moves at a very respectable pace - even on a base A1200.  I'm 
told that the game holds a very good 25fps even on this machine.  
The game is played in glorious 256 colours and it really does look 
the part. One example of this is the explosions in the game, they 
certainly improve on what has been seen it games of this ilk 
before. To add to the visual treat the game also features 3 layers 
of parallax strolling and some great background animations.

Sound isn't left out in the cold either as the game features a noce 
soundtrack that is constantly player throughout the game and also 
some very ambient sound effects.

Another nice feature that always suits this type of game is the 
support for 2 players. In UTW, two players can combine there 
efforts and take on the enemy simultaniously. As well as the 
Amiga version, Vorlon Software have also written Windows 95, 
MS-DOM and Linux versions of the game, all of these are 
included on the same CD.  The game is being sold for a very 
respectable £14.95.For details on how to purchase the game visit

Free Jelly Software: Terraces, Formula Miggy Racing

Free Jelly Software are a new development team in the UK. They 
currently have quite a few games in early stages of development, 
two of these are Terraces & Formula Miggy Racing.

The first of these, Terraces, is a football management game in the 
Championship Manager 2 style, however, it hopes to improve 
things on the playability front where CM2 sadly (Due more to the 
way it was programmed then the game itself) failed. Details on the 
game are low at the moment however, it will contain all of the 
things you would expect to find in a football management game 
these days including all English clubs with accurate player data, a 
massive range of tactics to choose from, intelligent AI computer 
opponents and a fair bit more. The minimum spec for this game will 
be a 020 Amiga with 4Mb RAM and a 2x speed CD-ROM drive, 
recommened is a 040 with 8Mb RAM.

The other game which they are concentrating on is Formula Miggy 
Racing. This, as the name suggests is a racing game. It takes 
place in a fully gourade shaded polygon 3D environment and I'm 
told it runs at a very good speed. It will contain 120 tracks set over 
a number of terrains including desert, forest, marsh and beach.  
You will be able to race as one of 12 charcters in either a car, boat 
or plane. The game will also include a link-ip option allowing over 
12 people to race against each-other. Minimum specs for the game 
are an 030 Amiga with 8Mb RAM and a CD-ROM drive, preferebly 
a 040 with 16Mb and a GFX card should be used. Both of these 
games include something which is described by the authors as 
being revelotionary. It is something that is called Accu-Speech©.  
Basically, this is real-time computer synthesised speech, that can, 
via the use of special voice files can simulate vityually any voice.  
This means that the commentry in the above games can actually 
be made to sound like real commentators on TV. 

I will hopefully have more info on these games quite soon.

  Latest on Forgotten Forever
=============================================

Charm Design have revealed more details and graphics on 
Forgotten Forever, certainly one of the more better C&C type 
games that are in the course of development for the Amiga.

Forgotten Forever is planned to feature up to 50-60 missions with 
mission disks also planned and it will have 4064*4064 pixel 
maximum terrain size, this is pretty vast as Dune II was only 
1024*1024. There will be 50 different vehicles at your disposal 
including air, sea and ground units for total warfare along with 
another 25-30 different buildings. The game will consist of multiple 
terrain types such as snow, desert, rock, forest and their are to be 
night missions. A very exciting feature is that you can have two 
Amiga's connected with nullmodem for two player mode and 
possibly a multi player mode for up to four players with modem or 
TCP/IP. The minuim requirements for your Amiga is AGA or 
CyberGraphX, 020 processor, 1MB Chip Ram, 4MB Fast Ram, 
and come on CD. But remember it will run far better on an even 
more upgraded Amiga. There is quite a lot of C&C style games 
lined up for 98 and next year with the competition strong to be the 
top C&C type game for the Amiga.  Forgotten Forever will most 
likely feature highly but we'll probably know more when the demo 
of Forgotten Forver is made available.

  In Shadow of Time Demo Released
==================================================

After a long delay a demo of 'In Shadow of Time' has finally been 
released. For those of you that don't remember this game it is a 
point & click adventure in the Monkey Island style. I brought you 
news on this game way back in early 1997, since then quite a lot 
has changed in the game, the developers have been promicing a 
demo for ages - only now have they got around to releasing it.

First impressions of the demo are quite good. The game runs very 
smoothly and the graphics look very good. The Advventure genre 
is yet another area where the Amiga has lacked games recently, 
other then Sixth Sense Inventigations there isn't much to base this 
game on apart from the older classics such as Monkey Island 2 
and even Beneath a Steel Sky.  As for if this will be better then 
these, well, that is something that'll we'll have to wait to find ourt, 
one thing is for sure is that it will have to be very good to surpass 
these. The game certainly isn't lacking in the features department, 
the engine of the game is particually impressive.  Graphics wise tt 
allows 384 colours on screen at once, has real-time image scaling 
routines, real-time shadow routines and much more. The game is 
completly OS friendly and thus allows multi-tasking, however, 
sadly it doesn't work with GFX cards. To play the demo you will 
require an AGA Amiga with at least an 68020 and 1,5-2Mb 
memory. Fast memory and a hard-drive are recommeneded.
