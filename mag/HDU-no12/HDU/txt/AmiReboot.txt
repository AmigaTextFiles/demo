AmiReboot v1.5

1.What is it?
This program was written for my friend. He adviced me to write it 
because he likes a cool look interface, and i was learning to 
program. This program is my first one, and when i started it i didn't 
know anything about programming on Amiga, and now i can work 
with basic libraries and build graphic interface. I want to thank my 
friend for this idea, because it is really cool and i like it too. In fact 
this program is another reboot utility. It asks you if you really want 
to reboot the machine, waits for pressing one of two buttons and 
restarts the system if you are agree. This utility is, of course, 
freeware.

2. Bugs and limitations.
To the moment of writing this documentation i haven't found any 
undocumented features in this program. In this version i added:
a) Now it works on kickstart 3.0!
b) Now you can change all the text in the window. Program has 3 
tool types now :

BODY - Requester body text.
REBOOT - Text for the reboot button.
CANCEL - Text for the cancel button.

3.Future.
I still want to add a pattern to the window. Also i've got two more 
suggestions. For the first, somebody want to put an animation into 
the left part of the window (like in ARQ). And for the second, i'm 
going to improve 3D look of the buttons.
