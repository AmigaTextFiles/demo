============================================
V1.5 Drop files on AppIcon to change icon.  Configurable.

============================================

IconHandler is a program to help manage file icons on 
Workbench. Say you create a file using a program which does 
not save icons with the file or saves them with icons you don't 
like. You might want to give that file an icon. Normally this 
would involve either copying an icon from another file using the 
CLI or using an icon editor to load an icon from another file and 
save it out to your new file.

But no longer.

Now, you can simply have an AppIcon on your desktop which 
sits and waits for you to drop files on it. Then you can select 
from a list of your favourite icons, click and...bang! Your file has 
a new icon.
