============================================

SUMMARY
This free utility makes operating system code a lot faster by 
copying Kickstart - the built-in part of the Amiga's operating 
system - into fast memory. It does this dynamically and can be 
activated or deactivated at any time. It has been tested on CPU 
accelerators made by Commodore, GVP, MacroSystem and 
Phase Five and written with compatibility and reliability in mind.

First Aminet Release: 3rd May 1998.

Unsolicited comment from an early user:
"Thanks for writing QuickROM. I'm amazed at how much better 
my 4000 with Cyberstorm Mach-II is working! Disk access is 
much faster, as well as FTP downloads. There's one site that I 
thought was just slow, but after installing QuickROM, the 
downloads fly. The only problem is that when I run QuickROM 
from the workbench instead of CLI, it gurus, while still speeding 
up the system. That doesn't really matter, though, because it 
works fine in my user startup."  - Dave Wright

Second Aminet Release: 21st May 1998.
In response to this and other comments I've added a Workbench-
friendly version (QuickROM_WB) which can be put into 
Wbstartup or run at any time by clicking on the icon, and added 
installation instructions.  - Simon N Goodwin

REQUIREMENTS
Any Amiga with Fast Memory and a 68040 or 68060 processor: 
LC, XC or MC version - as a MMU Memory Management Unit is 
required. Up-to-date SetPatch with CPU libraries, Enforcer or 
equivalent. Amiga include files to re-assemble the Workbench 
startup code.

BENEFITS
* Boosts speed of all Kickstart ROM routines by up to 30 times.
* Allocates RAM from the top of memory to minimise 
fragmentation.
* Allows de-allocation as well as allocation, freeing 516K 
memory.
* Full diagnostic Exec result codes for cases when it can't work.
* Avoids undocumented 68060.library hooks, for compatibility 
with all 68060 or 68040 systems with an MMU.
* Designed to suit 1 Mb Kickstarts as well as Commodore 512K 
ones.
* Works from CLI/Shell, Opus, AREXX, and now Workbench 
icons too.
* Freely distributable, with full assembly language source code.

Please see QuickROM.text and QuickROM.asm for more details.
