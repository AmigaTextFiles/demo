@{b}  INSTALATION AND USAGE@{ub}

Before you start the program, you might find it useful to copy all 
libraries and into LIBS : directory on your Workbench partition. 
This is especially valid if you dont have cando libraries installed 
yet. Then reboot computer and start the program ( click on the 
icon called HDU ). Problem info : miro.hacek@uni-lj.si

Usage
In second menu are some music options in menu called music. 
You can also quit HDU program clicking on Quit ( in the main menu ). 
In utility and game/patch/help parts of the program, you can print
documents, see pictures ( if any ) and install program. 
Program(s) will be automatically installed into directory, where
you have put HDU program. Also see instructions in the 
readme file on Aminet.

@{b} POSSIBLE PROBLEMS@{ub}

Program runs on all AGA Amigas with 6Mb RAM ( I 
think 4Mb will also be enough ). You will also need
about 3Mb free space on your hard drive. Tested
on 020/28 and 030/50 with 4Mb RAM. If program fails 
to run, please try xtra-libs ( math libs ), but before you 
do that, please backup your original libs.

@{b}  HISTORY & AUTHOR@{ub}

Until number 42 (or sep97) this program was available only 
in Slovenia in Slovene language. It was collection of utility 
programs on one disk without any graphical interface. 
Number 1 was produced on 15.03 1996. Till 01.07 1997 
there was 41 disks. Number 42 or sep97 is first graphical 
HD Utilities program -- rather enhanced mode. We hope 
we will be able to produce one number of HD Utilities every 
month and upload it to Aminet. Please, send us your 
comments and wishes and we will try to include all your 
wishes to the main program.
