@node introduction "x-files - introduction"

                              introduction

ok, my holidays are gone and i am back in germany. the trip to usa was very
cool, but every good thing has an end... :-(

this will be the last amiga-guide issue. from the next issue on, the x-files
will be a fully coded mag, with everything like graphical surface, modules
and a search function...

for the coded x-files issues we need title-pictures, x-files-logos,
ethic-logos (all aga or ecs, hires or hires-interlace, maximum size about
250kb) and some modules (maximum size about 200kb).
so if you want to help us to make the x-files looking and sounding better,
please do whatever you can... :)


and never forget:  read, spread and support the x-files !!!! :-)

ok, thanx for now and see ya soon...

@node wanted "wanted"

for the x-files i'm searching for up-to-date news:

with news i mean:

            - memberlists (with username and function (and country if possible))
            - newcommers (with old group if possible)
            - "go-away'ers" (with reason like new group, kicked, left scene))
            - general news about groups (like next releases, planed projects
                                         planned parties, and so on...)
            - information about parties (like invitations, results, reports,
                                         visitor-lists)
            - news about everything that's worth interesting

i can not check every news i get. so it is possible, that an error appears in
the x-files. don't blame me for this, but please mail me the error with the
correction and i will fix it immediately.

i am also searching for ascii-logos for x-files. 

so, if you have news, corrections, comments, suggestions, ideas or anything
else worth mentioning, then contact me at:

By car:

     on your left, then continue untill you see a big building with the
     sign SOLNA HALLEN on your left .

By train:

1:   Travel to STOCKHOLM and go to T-Centralen and take the subway towards
     AKALLA ,and when you reach SOLNA CENTRUM you get off, go towards
     STADIUM. If you go towards SOLNA CENTRUM you are lost.

2:   And then you will see a STATOIL gasstation ,go in that direction and
     follow Frösundaleden until you see SOLNA HALLEN ON YOUR LEFT!

By plane:

     Fly to ARLANDA airport and take the bus towards BROMMA and get of at
     SOLNA CENTRUM. And then find Mc.Donalds and STATOIL and follow the
     "By train 2:" instructions.

There will be signs posted from Solna station so you wont get lost.
