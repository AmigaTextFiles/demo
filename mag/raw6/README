If you want to run RAW from HD/RAM/CD (-: whatever,
just copy the files Raw6, (Raw6.info) and Raw6.data
into the same directory, and start it from there.
You also need the xpkmaster.library file and the
compressors/xpkNUKE.library in your LIBS: directory.

To iconify/quit RAW, press ESC inside the mag, then
use the menu or close-gadget.

Big thanks to Urban D Mueller and Bryan Ford for the
XPK package.
