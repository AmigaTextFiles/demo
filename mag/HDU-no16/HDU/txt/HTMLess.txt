HTMLess
===========================================

1. Introduction
===============
HTMLess is just another utility to extract the text inside HTML 
files (Web pages) and convert it to a readable text format.One 
month ago I released the first version, since them I received lot 
of EMails with bugs, ideas and support who keep me busy 
developing and improving HTMLess, I released 3 improved 
versions, today (1.May.96; btw it's my birthday *8) a major 
release is ready: v2.0, I hope this new version could fill the 
needs of everybody, my goal was a small, eficient, easy to use, 
fast and reliable program to convert WWW HTML pages to text 
files. I hope all you will find HTMLess useful.

The main features are:
- Fast, written 100% in assembler. (Even faster since v1.2, and 
the fastest with the new in v1.3 CLI option -w or the ToolType 
WINDOW disabled)
- Small but powerful utility (only 12000 bytes long).
- CLI and Workbench usage.
- ToolTypes support. [New since v2.0]
- Admit filenames as CLI parameters (can be launched from a
DiskMaster/DirOpus type program to autoconvert HTML's).
- All non-ASCII chars are converted.
- Output text could be formatted to easy reading.
- Can keep [href's] (like WWW adresses) in the output text.
- .HTML or .HTM filename suffix could be changed to your own 
defined text extension. [New since v2.0]
- The program will report any kind of errors.
- Very easy to use...just try it.
- WYSIAWYG (WhatYouSawIsAlmostWhatYouGet)
- Great results (complex AI routines used *8).
- HTML Lists converted to text lists.
- `HTMLess' is a wonderful name. 
- No annoying requesters when starting/using/quitting program.
- It's OriginalWare (OriginalWhat?) and it's only Amiga (Yeah!).
 
The only requirement is the "ReqTools.library" by Nico Francois 
and Magnus Holmgren who fortunately is continuing the 
development of the indispensable reqtools library.

If you need a custom version of this program (for a personal 
necessity); contact me and I will try to make a customized 
version for you (if it isn't to difficult or too much work).

If you think the sources (100% assembler) could be useful for 
you (to include in a program you are developing or for learning 
purposes) just contact me and ask for them.

OriginalWare ?
=================

This  utility  is OriginalWare.That means if you like this program 
you must buy  an  original Amiga program or game, or send the 
money to the author of any ShareWare program or game you 
are using often. (This includes me, $5 or $10 will be welcome)

There  are  lots  of  great Amiga software like `DiskMaster', 
`Remind', `MultiCX', `Spot', `ReqTools.library', `Deluxe Galaga', 
`APlayer' and a lot more that you won't never regret to spend 
your money. If you do this you support the Amiga, and if you 
support AMIGA you support US.Support software authors and 
you will get more and better software. This program could be 
included in any PD compilation at a symbolic price.

Aminet and Fred Fish collections are specifically allowed to 
include it. This program could be freely included in any Web 
page or FTP site, but send me an EMail to know it (I can include 
the address in this doc). For using them in commercial products, 
my written permission is required. Inclusion in magazines and 
diskmags will be allowed, if you send me a copy of this 
publication.
