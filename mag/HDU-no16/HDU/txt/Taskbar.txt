===========================================
Short: Win95 style taskbar v6.1 (Minor update)
Author: Robert Ennals
===========================================
Amiga TaskBar - Version 6.1
===========================================

===========
What is it?
===========
Just like the much praised Windows 95 taskbar, but for Workbench 
Simply click on buttons to maximise, bring to front or panel any 
workbench windows. This is not just a program launcher, it is a 
complete window manager!!
	      
This is an essential addition to everybodies WBStartup Drawer and
it isn't going to waste disk space. Since TaskBar v1 was released 
some other similar programs have appeared, but none come close 
to the power or stability of TaskBar.

If you have used a previous version (eg v5.2 that was released with
Amiga Computing) then read the changes section. If you are new to 
TaskBar then go straight to the features section. TaskBar comes 
with WBRun by Sylvain Rougier and Pierre Carrette

========================
Changes from other versions
========================
Changes since version 6
* Several bugs fixed in TaskBarPrefs
* Harmless enforcer hit removed from TaskBar (introduced with 
AUTOSHIFT)

Changes since version 5.3
* Prefs editor
* Minimise all windows (useful for a rapid cleanup if things get
slow, you run out of memory or you just want more space
* Shift and resize windows so they don't cover the taskbar
* Automatic shift when windows move (instead of having to ask it)
* Reload prefs - you can even chanage the number of buttons on 
the fly!
* Installer script (no more bad manual installs)
* Now includes WBRun in the distribution so nothing more to 
download
* Stay on top now optional (gets on better with drag and drop)
