===========================================
VersionWB is a replacement for the usual c:version command.

If you want the version information to be presented in a requester, 
this program is for you. Instead of like c:version just tell the version 
and revision number by default, VersionWB always tells you all it 
could find.

VersionWB have these features:

* It will bring up a requester with the version information.
* It support several files in the command line parameter template.
* You can shift-doubleclick an icon with VersionWB and then get all 
that version stuff.
* You may also pick the file you want to know the version number of
by using a file requester.
* It will find version strings in WB1.3 libraries and devices, c:version 
does not, e.g. narrator.device.
* If you use it with ToolManager you can have an appicon in your 
Workbench. Drop the icon on the appicon, and the version 
information will be presented (if the file contains a version string).
* It also have an optional text output.
