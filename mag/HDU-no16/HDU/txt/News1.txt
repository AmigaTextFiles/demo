Sadeness News
A lot of people have been wondering recently what has actually 
happened to Sadeness. There hasn't been a lot coming from them 
and the website hasn't been updated in months. 

Well, I can now inform you that they are still alive and sre still 
commited to the Amiga market. There has been a number of 
changes and reasons for the lack of news from them, them moving 
being one of these. However, Sadeness Software are now only 
part-time and cannot be contacted via phone, a new email 
address should be available soon. 

As for Operation: Counterstrike, well, they will still be publishing 
this game. I'm also told that they will also still be publishing Dafel: 
Bloodline although this isn't confirmed. As for Forgotten Forever, I 
have no idea at the moment, I will try to find out... 

===========================================
New Eat the Whistle Demo

A new demo of Eat the Whistle has been released. The game is 
already available from Epic Marketing and this demo is the final 
demo that will be released of the game. It is available from the 
Hurricane Software webpage at : 
http://www.freeweb.org/freeweb/hurricane 

===========================================
Olofight Update

This game was only recently released at the Computer '98 show 
and already the authors have announced that there will be an 
update released very soon. First of all, the authors have 
announced that they will be making a CD release of Olofight in 
about 2/3 weeks, I'm sure you'll agree, this is much better then the 
mammoth 10 disks that the game currently comes on. They will 
also be releasing a GFX board patch for the game which will be 
available in about a month. A new demo should be available soon.

===========================================
Settlers 2
===========================================

It was confirmed at the Computer 98 show that Titan Computer is 
to convert Settlers 2, a god sim to the Amiga but details have been 
hard to come by. Amiga Gamers should expect an excellent title 
that has already proved to be a success on the pc and mac with 
over a million copies sold. The storyline to the sequel is that after 
fighting a losing battle with the raging sea, a brave people find 
themselves stranded on an apparently uninhabited island. You 
must lead these survivors on the ultimate quest of world 
domination. Amiga Flame has now learned that Settlers 2 will 
feature Network Play ICP/ TCP and also have a random level 
generator.  It boasts over 30 different building types such as 
sawmills, metalworks, pig farms, coal mines and more, building a 
medieval empire. You can then send scouts to explore unknown 
territories and build catapults and use various types of soldiers to 
fight against the Vikings, Nubians and Asiatics.

Settlers 2 will surprisingly run on an 030 processor, with 16MB 
Fast Ram, 40MB Hard Drive and will be CD-Rom only.  A special 
PowerPC version will be included. You can visit Titan Computer at

Titan Computer logs
===========================================

I have recently had comments that the logs of the interview can be 
to long to read at times and it is difficult to pick up on specific 
answers to questions. Because of this, I have decided to write a 
short summary of the whole interview each week. This will start 
with the Titan Interview that was held on Sunday. 

* First of all, we'll concentrate of Claws of the Devil, the Tomb 
Raider like game that is in development. First of all, the game will 
be released in March/April and there won't be a demo until 2/3 
weeks before release (and not around now like was suggested at 
Computer '98). There will be no AGA version, only GFX card 
equiped machines will be supported. The game will run best on 
PPC although it will run on an 060 in low-res (res on PPC will be 
640x480). 

* To begin with, Claws will use the PowerUP kernal and not 
WarpOS like has been suggested. Permedia support will be 
included in the game although this will not be via Warp3D to start 
off with, instead the game will use the Permedia chip directly. 
Warp3D support may be added in the future. 

* Settlers 2. This will hopefully be released in late January, again, 
a demo will be released a few weeks before release. The game 
will run on both 68k & PPC. Titan were not given the whole 
sources to the game, only the sound and gfx sources. There will 
be additions to the original PC game such as TCP/IP support and 
a level generator. 

* Evils Doom: Special Edition will be released in January, the 3D 
engine in the game has not been completly reworked just mearly 
made smoother. 

* Any future high spec Amiga games will depend on the sales of 
Settlers 2, Titan will continue with other PC ports and also have an 
option on Settlers 3 if Settlers 2 sells well. If it sells badly, it could 
be the end. Whats good sales, well, Titan want 3000 - 4000 at 
least, if Settlers 2 doesn't get this then we might as well give up. 

* Shadow of the Third Moon 2 PPC is a possibility, however, PC & 
MAC versions of shadow 1 will be released first. 

* Total Combustion is still on the cards, first details of this are 
expected in the 2nd quarter of '99. 

* Titan currently have 2 PC conversions lined up for '99, they are 
in talks with several PC companies including Eidos.

Eat The Whistle Released
===========================================

Epic Marketing has released the long awaited soccer game, Eat 
The Whistle from developers Hurricane Studios. In Eat The 
Whistle there is the World cup, Leagues, Cups with real teams but 
of course players names have to be modified. Each player has 
more than 550 frames of animation, 300 for the goalkeeper and 
100 for the referee. There is around 30 types of pitches such as 
muddy, frozen and wet. It has an intuitive control system allowing 
acceleration/ deceleration of players, and of course for other 
aspects like fouls, corners, throw-ins, heading and other special 
shots. In "arcade mode" it plays more like Speedball 2 with the 
inclusion of powerups, bonuses to spice up the action even more.  
There is a 1 & 2 players mode but there is support for 3 & 4 
players mode using a 4 Joystick Adapter or Keyboard. It has a 
team editor and tactic editor, and what the authors describe as 
being a very complex menu. It includes spoken commentary and 
action replays which can be saved and loaded.

Hurricane Studios have said that it will work on all Amiga's, with 
support for GFX boards and also for AHI and sound cards. Those 
who have faster CPU's get a faster frame rate.  You can purchase 
Eat The Whistle from Epic Marketing at the bargain price of 14.99 
UK Pounds.  If you are still unsure whether to get it, then check 
out the new demo from the developers web site.

ClickBOOM News: Z Announced, Napalm Site up.
===========================================

ClickBOOM have finally announced that they will be releasing Z 
on the Amiga. It has been common knowledge for ages that they 
intended to do this, however, it hadn't, until now, been made 
official. 

Sadly, however, they give no details on the game, all that is 
revealed is that the game will make its way onto our screens 
sometime next year. This Command & Conquer varient from the 
Bitmap Brothers (Who made such classics as Speedball 2 & the 
Chaos Engine series) was quite successful in the PC market 
would be welcomed with open arms by many Amiga owners. 

There were rumours that the game was to be PPC only, however, 
I now believe this to not be the case although this hasn't actually 
been confirmed by clickBOOM in anyway. 

ClickBOOM have also made a long awaited update to the Napalm 
page on their site, however, they still have not given a idea as to 
when the game will actually be out mearly saying 'Napalm will be 
ready soon'. Hopefully it will be with us in time or christmas. 

It is also interesting to see that clickBOOM plan to have Napalm 
converted onto other platforms. I believe a PC version is already in 
the works and a MAC version may not be that far away. This 
movement into other markets can only be a good thing as is will 
hopefully fund the development of more Amiga games.
