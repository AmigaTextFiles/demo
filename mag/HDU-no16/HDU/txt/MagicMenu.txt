Frequently asked questions
===========================================
MagicMenu and the preferences editor may not always do what 
you expect them to. Here is a short list of such situations and an 
explanation of what has happened:

Cannot configure the multicolour menu colours
The preferences program needs at least 24 colours to display the 
settings page that controls the multicolour menu. As the operating 
system will always allocate 11 colours for itself, this means you will 
need to run the preferences program on a screen with at least 64 
colours available. 

The multicolour menu never shows up
I always get the old 3D look menu For the multicolour menu to 
work, MagicMenu needs to allocate the colours that make up its 
display from the set the screen has to offer it is to open on. Not all 
screens allow for this to work, as they may not have unallocated 
pens to work with or a colour palette which already has the correct 
colours in the right places. In these cases MagicMenu will fail to 
get the colours it needs and step back to the old style 3D menu. 
MagicMenu will also refuse to use the multicolour menu if the 
screen to use is a low resolution screen.

History
===========================================
MagicMenu versions 0.01 through 2.3 were developed by Martin 
Korndörfer. With V2.4 development passed into the hands of Olaf 
`Olsen' Barthel.

MagicMenu 2.11 (beta)
=====================
- The preferences editor now opens a custom screen with 32 
colours if it cannot get that many from the requested public screen.
- When MagicMenu has taken control of the menus, window depth
arrangement calls are no longer ignored, but delayed until the 
menu closes. Actually, I would have to add a whole lot more 
patches to make operation halfway safe, but for now I'm just 
plastering patches onto routines which are somewhat likely to get 
triggered while the menus are up.

Authors
===========================================
Martin Korndörfer wrote the original MagicMenu program. He is no 
longer involved in the development of the program. The 3D 
multicolour menu artwork and design were created by Mario 
Cattaneo. This documentation, the preferences editor and the 
development work following MagicMenu 2.3 were done by Olaf 
`Olsen' Barthel.

development, this the only address you can refer to.
