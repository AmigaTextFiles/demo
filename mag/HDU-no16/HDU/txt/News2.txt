APC&TCP Release Marblelous 2 And Flyin' High Patch
===========================================

APC&TCP have published Marblelous 2, the Marblelous series 
have never really struck me as being the best that Gaming has to 
offer us but it seems they must have sold enough copies last time 
to warrant a sequel. The publishers have stated that Marblelous 2 
isn't about extensive 3D graphics but gameplay. Just a few of the 
100 levels you'll be playing through Your mission is to guide up to 
three marbles around various walls to the exit by placing arrows. 
But before you can leave the level your marbles must collect the 
items and solve some little puzzles to reach the objects and the 
exit. Teleports, shields, rails and other items help you on your 
mission. A fourth marble (a grey one) is controlled by the 
computer who is out to destroy your marbles. Marblelous 2 boasts 
100's of levels and you can always make some more with the 
Level Editor that is included with the game. It is hoped that some 
of these creations will be placed in Aminet for other Marblelous 
Gamers to enjoy. 

Other news from APC&TCP is that they have just released a patch 
for graphics cards Gamers to use in Flyin' High. A reader informed 
Amiga Flame that it runs "a hell of a lot smoother now".

MAX Rally
===========================================

Price : £19.99
Publisher : Fortress
Requirements : All, 2MB Ram, HD Installable

I'm always a little nervous of a developer going it alone to publish 
their game, you always worry that without the backing of a 
publisher you're going to get 2 disks sent through the post, along 
with scribbled note informing you that you've just got the game 
you ordered. Worry not, for Fortress did a great little job with the 
packaging, with MAX Rally coming in a jewel case and with some 
fantastic covers. It's perfect for display in a shop, if only they 
would accept Amiga software.

MAX Rally comes on two disks, it can be played by floppy but to 
have it installed on the hard drive takes away all that annoying 
disk swapping.  It's just a matter of double clicking on the MAX 
Rally icon, fasten your seat belts, put the clutch in, rave the engine 
and your away just after you click on Championship, pick the 
player you want to be and chose the map you want to play from 
the various terrain's.

The MAX Rally Championship offers you the opportunity to race in 
25 tracks up against 3 opponents. They have split up the tracks 
into 5 scenario that a racing driving would have to face, the 
Woodland section, Cosmic (in space), the Dunes, Alpine and best 
section has to be Challenge. Each of these sections contain 5 
tracks all of varying difficulty levels, to find which ones are the 
easiest, is a matter of moving the joystick over the track where a 
star system gives awards the difficult tracks the most stars (the 
deadly ones have 5 stars). To complete the championship you 
must complete every course using only 5 continues or you're spun 
out of the Championship.

At last I have found a game that means what it says, MAX Rally in 
Easy mode is as it states easy unlike some other games that I 
won't name, but to some other games Easy mode means Insane 
mode for you're unlikely to beat it. For a few hours after winning 
numerous tracks, it seemed ridiculously easy but then I adjusted 
the settings.  I must of had a big head at the time for I chose Hard 
mode, the race started somewhat differently for a few brave 
seconds I was in the lead and then they got pass, the speed was 
incredibly fast, the car made huge jumps over the mounds and 
flew around corners. Even though I thought I was doing well, from 
behind came the three computer cars to overlap me. After that 
race, I decided to play in Medium mode - suited me just fine. 
I've been doing driving lessons for quite a while now, so I know 
there is still something missing in MAX Rally.  I have a tendency to 
brake at the very last moment when I'm out driving, it gives my 
driving instructor a heart attack, for at times you would think that 
I'm about to slam into the vehicle in front or into some other object 
and as my instructor keeps pointing out, I'll be doing his car in one 
of these days (especially after playing MAX Rally). It would have 
been really good if the rally cars in MAX Rally could be damaged 
when I ram into the car in front, or even some smoke just to give it 
some measure of realism.

I did play a preview of MAX Rally months ago and I thought at the 
time that it was pretty good but I did feel at the time that it wouldn't 
have that same appeal for those who would play it in one player 
compared with those multi-player games. But they have 
addressed this problem to some degree with the creation of a 
Challenge section, you've got to race 3 laps round the track, but 
this time you've got a few obstacles to deal with, the main one 
being that the screen moves independently around the track, so if 
you're going to slow then you are put out. You encounter such 
problems as falling off the edge of the track (use the moving 
platforms), or even off the side of the screen. And I won't explain 
about flashing pads.  The name of this section really rings true, for 
it is a Challenge.

The tracks in MAX Rally have been designed well and my overall 
impression is that the graphics are of a good quality.  I like the way 
they have added some obstacles to help and even hinder you, 
such as the ramp that allows you to jump ahead, or you can turn 
quickly in mid air for an upcoming bend, or jump straight into 
something off the track.

Nevertheless MAX Rally offers mainly a good deal to multi-player 
Gamers, providing you have a 4 player adapter or serial cable, 
you could have your friends round for some racing fun. Alright, so 
it's no Sega Rally but in my book it's still a fine game and I look 
forward to playing more games from Fortress.

Graphics 83% - "The racing envirnoment has been well created"
Playability 90% - "Easy"
Sound 78%- "Sound good music and the usual engine noises you 
would expect"
Addiction 76% - "Once you get the first few tracks under your belt, 
you won't finish until you win the Championship"
Lastability 74% - "You would need to be a racing fan to stay 
addicted"

Overall 80% - "Its no Sega Rally, but still a good overhead racer 
for those multi-player Gamers"

Bubble Heroes
=============================================

Arcadia Developments are a development team who were so 
bored by the lack of console/ japanese style games for Amiga, that 
they decided to develop their own game called Bubble Heroes, a 
puzzle/ adventure game in the same style as the popular Puzzle 
Bobble.  Bubble Heroes is 70% complete and they are currently 
looking for a Publisher. The story is based on the magical world of 
Radia that is in serious danger. The peacefulness and the joy of 
this realm is threatened by a dark, evil knight named Gonzul and 
his bunglers, arrived on floating islands from unknown parts of the 
universe. Gonzul's aim is to conquer and enslave the world; to do 
this they abduct the four Nimphs, sources of power and pillars of 
peace and richness, bleeding their energy and life.  But as they 
were being abducted, the Queen of these Nimphs, Adora spread 
by her mental powers a message to all the heroes of Radia; to 
rescue the Nimphs. Three Heroes hear the calling - Nekochan a 
young mercenary cat-girl, Gupochi a valiant prince transformed 
into an amphibian creature and Yorumaru a brave and bold knight 
in search of glory.  Bubble Heroes is made up of four worlds, 
containing 60 levels in which you have to free the jailed Nimphs 
from Gonzul's bunglers.

The game can be played in various modes, story mode, 
championship mode, VS playing mode with a human player or the 
computer.  There are of course three playing characters each with 
their own story that leads to a different ending sequence, this all 
wrapped up in a truly manga style with cute animation's. There is 
lots of graphic special effects such as transparencies, animated 
backgrounds, multiple scrolling playfields during the game, 
gigantic objects, tons of colours on screen, all running at 50 fps.  
Bubble Heroes also includes it own CDDA soundtracks.

Bubble Heroes will require an Aga Amiga with at least an 020 
processor, 4MB Fast Ram, and will be CD-Rom only.
