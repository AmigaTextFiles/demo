PointerX
===========================================

=======================
What does it do and why ?
=======================
Some time in 1994, I got a program called PointerX 2.0 from a 
magazine coverdisk, which made me think `Cool!, This program 
makes the hands on the busy pointer spin!' However, after 
loading the program on my 1200, it refused to animate the busy 
pointer!

So, I threw the disk back into the diskbox, and continued with 
everyday life. That was, until one day when I was soooo bored 
whilst waiting for a program to assemble, that I thought, `shame 
PointerX don't work, it'd look real neat right now'. A quick 
disassembly/fix-up later, and PointerX 3.00 was made.

And since then, I've been updating PointerX the whole time.

Version 4 saw more or less a complete re-write, as some features 
were impossible to implement easily on the old framework. The 
4.x generation brings resolution support, Choice of one or two 
hands, Recognition of more busy pointers, better patching, lower 
usage of memory, and probably much more to come!

Some people have suggested that I shouldn't take credit for 
PointerX However, I would like to point out, that the only remnant 
of Steve Tibbetts PointerX 2 in my version, is the pointer graphic 
data. (And as of v4.5 even that has changed!) EVERYTHING has 
been recoded, now, completely from scratch, and bears very little 
resemblance to Steve's original version. Also, I think, judging by 
the structure of the v2.0 code, I'd say that Steve's version may 
have been written in C.

Requirements
=============
To run PointerX you need...
° Workbench 2 or above. (Yup, now even WB3 is okay!)
° Something that sets the busy `clock' pointer
(To test it, Load a workbench, select `execute program' and click
back in the workbench screen ;^) 
*NB: Since v4.1, PtrX will also replace busy pointers from several
other programs.

No other requirements whatsoever.
