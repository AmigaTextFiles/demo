=========================================

VideoText V5.41+, download teletext pages into the amiga, browse 
them, save them, print them. Requires a teletext decoder chip (SAA 
5246) with an I²C bus interface to the amiga, e.g. the one described 
in "c't" magazine. Many features, including job queue, list of 
favourite page numbers for each TV station, page monitoring on 
screen or to a file. German version, German docs only, but with an 
Installer script in both English and German.  And there's an English 
"localization" available (by Adriano de Minicis): 
hard/drivr/VTXT_eng_pch.lha. VideoText is Postcard-ware.
