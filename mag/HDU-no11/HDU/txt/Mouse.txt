AnalogMouse v1.0 by Piotr Pawlow (PP/UNION)
================================================

1. Introduction
AnalogMouse is a CLI-only tool that allows you to control your 
mouse with an analog joystick connected to the joystick port.  You 
can use your joystick to work with the system as well as play many 
mouse-only games. I tried it with DoomAttack, ADoom and 
MegaBall and it was working very well.  (To be honest - I made this 
program just to be able to play DoomAttack with my analog 
joystick, compatibility with the system and other games is simply a 
side-effect.

2. Disclaimer, legal things etc.
This program is freeware...  Thus it's free...  So you can copy it, 
give it to your friends, change it, do with it whatever you want (even
delete it) freely. I am not responsible for any damage this program 
may or may not do, so use it at your own risk BLAHBLAHBLAH :)))

3. Requirements
Any Amiga with at least Kickstart 2.0, about 8KB of free memory 
and 6KB of free disk space. (or at least Pentium Pro 200 with a 
huge hard drive and a lot of memory, running UAE.
