Introduction
TTManager began as an attempt to improve upon the tooltype 
editing features offerred by Workbench's standard icon information 
requester. With version 2.0 it's become a complete alternative to 
theinformation requester, allowing the user to not only manipulate 
tooltypes, butalso the protection bits, file comment, icon type, and 
more.  ...And all this with an easy to use, resizable, font-sensitive, 
localized, GadTools GUI. 

Features :
* Font-sensitive, resizable, style guide compliant GUI.
* AppIcon and AppWindows for drag & drop convenience.
* Adds itself to Workbench's Tools menu (AppMenu item).
* It's a Commodity.
* Button-bar with the following features : add, toggle, delete, move, 
duplicate, cut to Clipboard,...
