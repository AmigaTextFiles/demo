   NEWS ABOUT AMIGA GAMES -part 1
================================================

================================================
Quake, Foundation & Genetic Species all Released
================================================

After lots of waiting by Amiga users all three of these games were 
released in the same week. 

Quake is a game that we all know about, a massive PC port that 
has caused a hugh stir in the Amiga community. It is probably the 
peak of multi-player gaming, and although the multi-player aspect 
of the game won't be available to us until Quakeworld is ready, it 
doesn't really matter as the one player game can be just as 
engrossing. Sadly though, until a PowerPC version is available to 
get the best out of this game your going to need an 060.

One thing to remember is that when you buy Quake, your not just 
getting one game - you are giving yourself access to the massive 
range of total conversions that use the Quake engine, these are 
virtually new games in themselves. One example of these is 
Malice, this was sold commercially seperately from Quake, its that 
different.

The second of the games released is Foundation. Again, this is a 
game that has been eagerly awaited by many. It takes all the best 
parts of games like Settlers, Warcraft, Command & Conquer and 
moulds them all into one game. Originally due for release at 
christmas last year, it has had a host of new features that have 
been continously added to it. Infact there were so many features 
to be added that the author didn't have time to fit them all in for 
the games release, however, this will be rectified after release 
with a number of patches.

Foundation has gained almost a cult following since it was 
announced with constant updates being released letting the 
Amiga public know what was going on. The game looks the part 
too with some stunning looking graphics and in-game rendered 
pictures.

The game contains literally hundreds of features, far to many to 
list here that will make it one of the best games you have played 
on the Amiga in a long time. This is one game you should not be 
missing out on.

The last but by no means least of the 3 releases is Genetic 
Species. Developed by Marble Eyes this is another 3D shoot - em 
- up to enter the Amiga market. However, this could easily be the 
best so far. While it doesn't have the complicated engines of Alien 
Breed 3D 2 and Quake, it makes up for this in the speed and 
action departments. Thats not to say that the game doesn't look 
good though as it has some amazing special effects. One of the 
biggest features of the game is the fact that it will run even on an 
030/50mhz at a very acceptable rate - the engine is amazingly 
fast, something that really has to be seen to be believed.

================================================
Samba World Cup
================================================
Samba World Cup is a new football management/action game 
from German developers Sayonare Software. It is a follow-up to 
Samba and Samba Professional which received German only 
releases. Currently, as far as I know, this is what Samba World 
Cup is set for - A German only release, although this could easily 
change. Details on the game are quite low, however, I can tell of 
some of the features that the game will include. It will support both 
AGA and ECS, with the AGA version being in 256 colours and the 
ECS version in 16/32 colours, all graphics will be in hi-res.

In will features extensive detail including a massive range of 
statistics, 6 european leagues, all european cups, over 30 
national teams and much more. It will feature speech commentry 
throughout the game, has 2 player support, supports GFX cards 
and will also come with a utility with which you can edit the details 
of the game. I'll hopefully be able to bring you more news soon.  
Currently, the game is set for a June 1998 release on both 
CD-ROM and disk. For more information about the game, check 
out the developers webpage (Currently in German) out at :

Virtual Karting 2 Demo Released.
================================================

A demo of the terribly delayed Virtual Karting 2 has been released 
on Aminet. The original Virtual Karting was released back in late 
1995 and received a mixed responce with people either loving or 
hating it. Virtual Kerting 2 hopes to pick up on the points where 
the previous game failed, with this demo you have the chance to 
see if it does this. For those of you that don't know, Virtual Karting 
is ( suprisingly enough ) a kart racing game. It is quite unlike any 
racing game on the Amiga in that it is completly texture mapped - 
the only game that it bears any real likeness to is the excellent 
Xtreme Racing. You have a choise of two different karts in the 
game, these are a 125cc and a 80cc kart. Both have their good 
and bad points ie. the 125cc is very powerful but can be difficult to 
control, whereas the 80cc one has the opposite characteristics.  
Both manual and automatic gears are available for both karts 
making driving easier for the beginner and also giving the more 
experienced player the chance to get more out of the karts. The 
game is also billed as being very realistic, all of the karts have 
identical performance, so you won't be able to just steam past 
your opponants on the straight. You'll have to use techniques 
such as slip-streaming and braking later to pass them. There are 
a host of improvments in the game over the original Virtual Karting
including many more tracks, 2x1 resolution, on-road objects, 
water reflections, control improvments and much more. The game 
was released on both CD-ROM and disk. The game engine is 
extremlly fast, getting 50fps on just a basic A1200. It would be 
very interesting to see what this guy could do woth faster 
machines, sadly it isn't looking as though we'll see much more 
Amiga stuff from this guy in the immediate future.

Shock News!  Amiga Maim & Mangle Cancelled
===========================================

Vulcan & Deimos Designs have just released news that will come 
as a massive shock to many (although not all, rumours that this 
would happen have being flying around) that all Amiga versions of 
Maim & Mangle have been cancelled. This news comes just a few 
weeks after the PPC version was scrapped due to many problems 
with the format. They have now deleivered a massive a bombshell 
to the Amiga community that they will also be stoping development 
of 68k Amiga versions, PC versions of the game have also been 
cancelled.  The team will be starting a number of new projects that 
will be released on PC CD-ROM only.

Maim & Mangle was a Command & Conquer clone that was being 
eagerly awaited by the Amiga community, it promised much - things 
that have never been seen a game of this type before, sadly it 
would seem we'll never get to see how these would have turned 
out. The reason for this decision?  Well, there are a lot of things 
that have happened in the Amiga community since the game was 
started that have dampened the enthusiasm of the developers, 
however, the biggest reason was the constantly eroding Amiga 
user base. I would like to point out that development of Explorer 
2260 is still moving along nicely and that Deimos Designs no longer 
have anything to do with World Foundry. All is not lost though, we 
still have Commandstrike, Napalm & Forgotten Forever coming our 
way, however, although nothing was ever seen of Maim & Mangle - 
it certainly sounded great. Another one bites the dust.....

================================================
News in Brief: 8th June 1998.
================================================

Lambda Continues to Improve.
Lambda, the space combat game for the Amiga is still moving along 
nicely. On this page there are a couple of screenshots from the 
latest version of the game - I'm sure you'll agree, they look better 
then ever. This latest version includes background planets and lens 
flare. New features are constantly being worked on with the game 
currently being re-coded to assembly in selective areas - speed 
increases of up to 120% have been experienced.  It is also worth 
noting that Lambda is now FPU only. More news when I get it.

clickBOOM Update
With the release of Quake out of the way for clickBOOM they are 
now concentrating on QuakeWorld.  For those of you that don't 
know, this makes internet play a much better experience by 
removing the lag problem which is often encountered.  Hopefully 
this will be with us sometime in June so get ready to go kick some 
arse!
clickBOOM have recently been at the E3 show in Atlanta showing 
off their latest game Napalm, giving the Amiga massive exposure in 
one of the biggest shows - I'm sure the game got itself some 
massive attention.  On a different note regarding Napalm, the 
minimun specification for the game RAM wise has changed to 
16Mb. This is due to the hugh amount of animations that the game 
will feature, clickBOOM are still considering a slightly cut-down 8Mb 
version though.
