World of Amiga Report
=============================================

Previous years WoA shows have been quite dull, however, this 
years show was quite different. For the first time for quite a while 
we finally have some positive news that seems to have made 
quite a lot of Amiga users and developers happy. However, the 
'big announcment' wasn't the be all and end all of the show 
though as there was plenty of other things going on.  

Unfortunalty, the thing that the readers of this page are most 
interested in wasn't quite as well represented as some might 
have hoped. There were quite a few new games which were 
promised to be unveiled at the show that were not there in any 
form whatsoever.

The biggest games news of the show had to be the release of 
four top games. Namely these were Foundation, Quake, Genetic 
Species and Virtual Karting. The first three of these were very 
popular and seemed to be selling vert well, however, things didn't 
seem to be so good for Virtual Karting.

The biggest games display at the show had to be the Weird 
Science stand, not only were they selling the big three releases 
but they also had demonstrations of all three games. Paul 
Burkey was around to help promote his game Foundation, he 
was signing copies as they were being sold and was also giving 
demos of the game to anyone that wanted to see it. Quake was 
also running on this stand and at quite a pace too, I didn't find 
out what machine it was running on but it certainly wasn't slow.  
Weird science were also selling a hugh range of add-ons for 
Quake including Malice, time of reckoning and a number of 
mission disks. The Weird Science stand was also host to the 
developers of Dafel: Bloodline, unforunalty, they didn't actually 
have a demo as was planned, however, they did have a 
slideshow running that showed bits if the game. Another 
disappointment was that one of best looking games that is due to 
be coming out way, Forgotten Forever, wasn't there in any form.

Power Computing were also there selling a wide range of 
hardware for the Amiga, it was planned for them to have a demo 
of Golem running, however, it would seem that this fell through 
as it wasn't anywhere to be seen. Quite a shame really as going 
by the demo of the game I have seen it would have gained a lot 
of interest from the shows visitors. According to Power 
Computing the game should be with us sometime in the 
Summer. 
 
Epic Marketing could also be found at the show, they had two 
stands. One of which was devoted to a massive range of Amiga 
games and another which was demonstrating their latest 
releases, Virtual Karting and Sixth Sense Investigations. Both of 
these were getting a moderate amount of interest, however, I'm 
sure the stand would have been much busier if the promised 
Shadow of the Third Moon 2 PPC (Which I have heard was a 
complete rumour and doesn't actually exist) and Claws of the 
Devil were there. On the more serious side they did have a demo 
of Elastic Dreams which looked very good.

Another non-attender to the show was clickBOOM. Allthough 
Quake was being demonstrated on both the Weird Sceince and 
Amiga Format stand they had other commitments and couldn't 
make it. This meant that there forthcoming game, Napalm, wasn't 
at the show in any form. A shame as I'm sure it would have got 
no-end of interest from Amiga owners. Hopefully they will be 
presenting it at the forthcoming Canadian show.

Other companies you could find at the show included Alive 
Mediasoft. They were selling a massive range of games, 
however, they didn't have the long awaited Haunted on display 
like was promised. The release of this game has now been held 
back till later in the summer. There was also mention from them 
about a new car racing game they have on the way, hopefully, I'll 
have more details about this soon.

On the Amiga Inc. stand there were a number of products being 
demonstrated including the new wordprocessor from Haage & 
Partner, easywriter and Netconnect2 (Which incidently should be 
available in a couple of weeks), there was also a very 
atmospheric display for Genetic Species which I must say looked 
absolutely stunning.  It was running at an exceptional pace and 
allthough the demo machine was a 060 with CyberGFX graphics 
card it runs on lower powered machines just as well. The Amiga 
Inc stand was also giving out Amiga goodies including pens, 
posters and the odd CD too, Petro was on hand a lot of the time 
and was signing anything that people wanted him to.

Another demonstration that may be of interest to games players 
was the CyberVisionPPC. This looked quite impressive, 
however, it wasn't available at the show - I'm informed that it will 
hopefully be available at the end of June. Due to the nature of 
the Amiga Inc. news Phase5 were not too happy, if this delays 
the release of the card I don't really know.

The AAA award winner was also annouced at the show, it was 
won by Miami author Hodger Kruse for his exceptional work on 
getting Amiga owners onto the Internet. There were also a 
number of conferences held which explained specifics about the 
Amiga future, the biggest of these had to be the developers one, 
if you were lucky enough to have got into this you would have 
been able to hear some things that a lot of developers seemed 
very happy about. I have heard that some stunning things were 
announed.

This years show also had the unvailing of the Amiga Hymn.  The 
playing of this was accompanied by and excellent dance 
performance by Annex. This was a massive crowd puller, 
although I'm not too sure if all these people were there for the 
right reasons. Seriously, the song is actually quite good and is 
something you may actually listen to again if got yours hands on 
one of the CD's. Of course, the bar was quite busy as you'ld 
expect and quite a few people were sinking down pints at quite a 
regular rate, the only downpart of this was the very thin plastic 
pint containers they were provided in - they broke quite easily. 
So, to sum things up, it was a good show, however, in my 
opinion it could have been quite a bit better - escpecially for 
gamers.  The show in general was very well organised but could 
have done with being held in a bigger centre as it was very 
packed, moving around wasn't the easiest thing. I'll be looking 
forward to next years show...

Power Computing Sign up Golem
===============================================

Many of you may remember the Golem from the articles I wrote 
about it quite a while ago. Well, the game has now been signed up 
by Power Computing. Power Computing have released excellent 
games such as Big Red Adventure and Breathless in the past.

Golem is an adventure like game, you will control the Golem 
though a number of levels. The game is being billed as being an 
interactive film. The game is completly rendered with Lightwave, 
contains full motion video and has some snimated sequences that 
will make your jaw drop.

It will also contain a number of sub games including a beat-em-up 
and a shoot-em up. The game is looking as though it will be 
something very special, I have played a small demo of it whihc is 
quite old now and even that is very good.  I can't wait to see how 
much it has improved since then. To run you will require a 
minimum of a 6x Cd-ROM drive, a 68020 and Fast RAM present.  
A 68030 is reccomeneded along with 8Mb RAM.  GFX card 
versions are also in development. The game will be released on 2 
CDs, hopefully in June. For more information about that game 
check out the Power Computing website out

===========================================
Marblelous 2
===========================================
You prefer gameplay than extensive 3D graphics? Then 
Marblelous 2 is the right choice for you.

Your mission is to guide up to three marbles around walls to the 
exit by placing arrows. But before you can leave the level your 
marbles must collect the items and solve some little puzzles to 
reach the objects and the exit. Teleports, shields, rails and other 
items help you on your mission. The fourth marble (which is grey) 
is controlled by the computer and wants to destroy your marbles.

With the included editor you can create your own levels by simply 
clicking some gadgets. Another feature is that you can use your 
own graphics from any IFF paint program. With this it's possible to 
use figures instead of marbles. Or just paint anything you want! 
Marblelous 2 will look like a new game if you change all graphics! 
With the editor you can also define time and other features of 
every level. You can even choose passwords.

Features :
- about 100 Levels
- Level-Editor
- possible to use own graphics
- you can send your own levels to Aminet
- AGA/ECS/RTG-Support (CyberGraphX/Picasso96-boards)
- runs on any Amiga (but uses modern hardware)

Available: July '98.

PFS 2 - To be released in July 1998
================================================

GREat Effects Development proudly presents the new 
Ami-FileSafe...it's called PROFESSIONAL FILESYSTEM 2! After 
the failing support and all the complaints about former AFS 
distributor Fourth Level Developments, the author, Michiel Pelt, 
reclaimed copyright and will republish PFS2 under the label of 
GREat Effects Development. PFS2 is the BEST filesystem for your 
Amiga. 

Improvements over Ami-FileSafe
* special price for registered AFS users
* 68000, 68020, 68040 and 68060 versions
* Build-in interface for live optimiser. There is no optimiser yet, but  
this interface makes it possible to optimise the disk without taking  it 
off-line. When the disk is accessed during optimisation, PFS2  will 
stop the optimiser, which can continue afterwards. A dormant  
optimiser can even be automatically notified when the system is 
idle, making optimisation completely transparent.
* improved testing procedures making PFS2 more stable and 
reliable then  ever before.
* enhanced documentation including programming docs (disk 
structure and  special packets).
* new versions of all supplied tools (bug-fixes mostly), pfsls, 
diskvalid etc 
* full support plus disk repair service
* fully Ami-FileSafe compatible
* early problem detection mechanism. The early problem detection  
mechanism detects problems with your disk before it is too late, 
ensuring  optimal protection of your data.
* extended disk structure to make disk-repair easier
* Comes on CD

Plus all that Ami-FileSafe already had 
* superior performance. Up-to 500% improvement over FFS.
* disk are always valid. No more 'validation disk'!
* reliability
* concurrent access without performance loss. PFS2 handles 
simultaneous accesses very well!
* easy file-recovery with the delete directory. Getting a deleted file  
back never was so easy.
* automatically truncated logfiles. Get rid of those ever growing 
logfiles.

================================================
Update: TraumaZero.
================================================

Remember this? That excellent looking shoot-em-up that was 
featured in HDU a while ago. Some of you may even remember the 
rolling demo that was released on Aminet. Well, I'm pleased to tell 
you that development of the game is still going on and it's getting 
better all the time. The Amiga hasn't seen a decent shoot-em-up for 
quite a long time now.  The last ones that really spring to mind are 
Super Startdust and Project X. TraumaZero is probably more in the 
Project X vain then anything else. The game moves along at an 
excellent pace and is also very smooth. The game runs in 256 
colours, one of very few shoot-em-ups to boast this. It will have 
both horizontal and vertical scrolling, both at 50hz, it also boasts 
some very complicated routines which allow there to be many 
objects on the screen at once all moving around without any 
slowdown.
Moving away from the technical side, the game also offers some 
very exciting gameplay features. It will support both one player and 
simultaneous 2 player options. Each player will be able to select 
from 3 different ships all with there own features, there will also be 
a hidden ship in the game which you'll have to find yourself. Also, a 
nice authentic touch is that you'll be able to choose the colour of 
your ship, no more getting mixed up with whos ship is who in 
2-player games.

Other features that the game boasts includes CD Soundtrack, 
Speech & Sound-FX, animated raytraced intro sequence, 5000+ 
frames of animation and much more. To run the game you will 
require an AGA Amiga with at least a 030/50mhz, 4Mb Fast RAM, a 
hard-disk and a CD-ROM.  Faster processors will also be supported
with seperate versions for 040 and 060 processors. A release date 
for the game has not yet been set, however, I will let you know as 
soon as I have anymore info.

Amiga Survivor
===============================================

For a long time there has been no Amiga Games Publications 
especially after the closure of Amiga Power, Amiga Action and One 
Amiga well over two years ago. This is to change with the first Amiga 
Games Publication called Amiga Survivor to be published in late 
June. This is a significant step being taken by the makers but we 
must give our support and buy it every month for it to be a success. 
Amiga Survivor is being run by Robert Iveson who is the Editor & 
Writer and is also the Managing Director of the Amiga Publishing 
Department of Crystal Software International. Robert Iveson thought 
it was about time a dedicated Amiga games magazine was produced 
after the appearance of so many Games Developers, companies all 
making games for the Amiga.  He use to run The Domain magazine 
which covered the PD and Shareware scene.

Crystal Software International have offices in the Netherlands, US, 
UK, Australia and Japan, they will be advertising and distributing 
Amiga Survivor on a worldwide scale. The publication division 
distribute many magazines for many different platforms such as 
Atari, PC, Playstation & M-Crystal.

The main purpose of Amiga Survivor is to provide news, previews 
and reviews of all the forthcoming commercial, freeware, shareware 
and licenceware titles. It will feature regular articles such as 'Website 
of the Month', The Fifth Column (a general rant about the world of 
computers), The Trashcan (Software to be avoided!), Aminet 
Ramble (a monthly dig into the recent Aminet postings), Magnetic 
Fiction - (A collection of short stories from Andy Campbell), Joe and 
Ami - (An Amiga related exclusive comic strip), there will be a letters 
page, a hints and tips page and a section for readers to submit their 
own ideas for games.  It's going to be cramped full with everything 
on Amiga games and this is only a small taste so what to expect.

Amiga Survivor will be Mail-Order only initially as Newstand 
publication is a little on the expensive side but it may hit the 
newstands in Germany. It will be an A5 mag, black and white with 
hopefully a colour cover including around 40+ pages every month, 
the first issue is out in late June.  I know that for a long time many 
Amiga Gamers have wanted a Amiga Games only Publication, 
Amiga Survivor provides this but it needs our input and support, so 
we must buy an issue. This is a great opportunity and we can't let it 
go. You can e-mail Robert Iveson, the Editor & Writer your ideas and 
support to :

thedomainenterprise.net

To order your copy of Amiga Survivor, send a cheque or postal order 
of £2.95 UK Pounds, made payable to 'Robert Iveson' sending it to:-
