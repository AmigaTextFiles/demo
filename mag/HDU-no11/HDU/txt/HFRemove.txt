HFRemove
================================================

Requirements
Hardware: CPU : 68000, RAM : 512 Kb, HD : Prg : No FMS : Yes, 
OS: 3.x
Software: Device :  fmsdisk.device (v3.0), Command : Assign

Usage
Simply double-click the icon to start. After that a window will be 
opened, where you can select and remove a fms-device, if 
mounted. The program can be left by clicking the menuitem 'Quit' or 
by clicking on the CLOSEGADGET. The menuitem 'About' will give 
you some information. The menuitem 'Info' outs the diskname of the 
actual device. This is very useful, if more devices were mounted and 
you just know their names, but not which device has what name, 
because the system just displays the disk-names.

The menuitem 'HFMount' let's you start the HFM program, with it 
you can mount the units. You can specify the path of this tool, by 
editing the tooltypes and alter the 'HFMount' type. Default is C:HFM.
(Example: HFMount=C:HFMount) The menuitem 'Sleep' let you 
iconify the program. The program isn't useless in this mode ! Take 
the icon of a dms, lha or lzx archive and let it drop onto the appicon 
and select the device or dir. It will be unpacked automatically ! You 
can also take more than one archive !

Background
Once a day I discovered the HFM-archive and was very enthuiastic 
in using virtual floppies on my HD. So i decided to use this program 
in my system. But the concept had one disadvantage - i wasn't able 
to remove these disks from system again whithout using a shell and 
many commands and chars. So i wrote a little cli command, which 
should do all the work in one cycle. But i still had to use a shell, 
what i didn't like as a satisfied workbench user. So i created a gui 
for the command and HFRemove v1.0 was born. But i didn't like the 
split into two seperate programs and one of them 
(IFMSDR-Command) was written in a basic, what wasn't an 
advantage, neither for the size nor for the memory usage. So i 
decided to link these two parts in one program - and i think i did the 
work well - in version 1.1 of HFRemove...
