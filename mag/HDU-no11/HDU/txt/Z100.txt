   Z100 - ZIP drive tools
===================================================

Installation

The installtion  of  Z100  is  imaginable  easy,  because  neither
external  commands,  function  librarys  nor  a tedious assign are
Needed. The included installerskript will normally find out the 
devicename and unit of your SCSI-drive automatically. In order to 
do this the drive must be switched on and it must be mounted. The 
skript  will save  those parameters into an ENV:-variable and also 
they will be filled into the tooltypes of the icons.  Afterwards  the  
software package will be copied to a choosen location on your 
harddrive. I appreciate to use the script because even experienced 
users  may encounter  problems  when they install the package 
manually, which could be avoided by the usage of the script.
