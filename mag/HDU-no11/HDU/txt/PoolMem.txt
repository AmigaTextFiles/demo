================================================

Several people reported instabilities when running PoolMem. I can't 
reproduce any of these crashes here at my system, thus if you find 
a REPRODUCABLE crash, please, please let me know!

NEWS FLASH: Found serious bug in XiPaint that caused crashes 
with PoolMem, check below for details.

1.22:
PoolMem merges now automatically all adjacent memory lists of the 
same type. 

About PoolMem:
If you run a lot of programs without resetting the system, you'll 
usually find that the main memory of the computer is getting 
"messed up", split in lots of tiny memory "snippets" that are more or 
less useless due to their tinyness. It may happen that you can't start 
an application even though enough memory is available - because 
this memory is too fragmentated to be of any use. That's the point 
where PoolMem tries to help you: It manages the main memory in a 
way such that it can't get fragmentated too easely. It replaces also 
the function of AllocP, which is therefore obsolete.
