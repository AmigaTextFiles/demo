                   Release Date: September 15, 1998



o  Created  and  released  at the Vectors Development Meeting in Opava
   (yeah, and we enjoyed the party very much...!)

o  This is version 1.2, optimized & fixed.

o  Program, music                  Trixie
   Logo, font, symbols, design     Spider
   Animation                       Viper

o  Requirements: OS3.0 or later (AGA not needed :-)
                 medplayer.library V5 or later

o  The program was done in AmigaE 2.1b, so don't expect miracles...

o  The  programmer himself is a musician and a student of linguistics,
   so don't expect miracles...

o  EVERYTHING was done very QUICKLY, so don't expect miracles...

o  The  program  tries to be as system friendly as possible (no direct
   hardware access), but don't expect miracles...

o  No CyberGFX support I'm afraid...

o  Runs only in PAL, sorry...

o  Tested on: A1200, OS3.0, 68EC020, NO FAST
              A1200, OS3.0, 68030, 8MB FAST
              A1200, OS3.1, 68030, 32MB FAST
              A1200, OS3.0, 68040, 16MB FAST

o  Should  you  get a 'Music module missing!' error-message, make sure
   you run the intro from the directory where both the program and the
   module reside.

o  If  you  start  the intro from a diskette without running Workbench
   you  must  execute SetPatch before. Do the same under UAE or Fellow
   on the PC.

o  Trixie is much obliged to Jofa, LG, and Shaman for their advice and
   valuable help.

o  Thanks for moral support: Future Sound Of London, Coldcut, Intense,
   His  Name Is Alive, Neotropic, Renegade Soundwave, Tangerine Dream,
   Massive Attack, Levellers...

o  This production is FREELY DISTRIBUTABLE as long as the program, the
   music module, and this text file remain unchanged.

o  Medplayer.library is © RBF Software.
