                              Imagine there's no WINDOWS
                                 It's easy if you try
                             No fatal errors or new bugs
                               To kill our hard drives
                                Imagine Mr. Bill Gates
                                 Leaving us in peace!

                            Imagine neverending hard disks
                                 It isn't hard to do
                              Nothing to del or wipe off
                                  And no floppy too
                                Imagine Mr. Bill Gates
                                Sharing all his world

                               You may say I'm a hacker
                               But I'm not the only one
                            I hope someday you'll join us
                            And our games will fit in RAM

                                  Imagine 1-giga RAM
                                 I wonder if you can
                           No need for left-shift or setups
                            And no booting again and again
                            Imagine all operating systems
                                Working all life-time!

                               You may say I'm a hacker
                               But I'm not the only one
                         Maybe someday I'll become a cracker
                           Then I'll make my WINDOWS run !

                                 Sits at the keyboard
                          And waits for a line on the screen
                                   Lives in a dream
                                  Waits for a signal
                                  Finding some code
                       That will make the machine do some more.
                                   What is it for?

                  All the lonely users, where do they all come from?
                   All the lonely users, why does it take so long?

                 Typing the lines of a program that no one will run;
                                    Isn't it fun?
                                 Look at him working,
               Munching some chips as he waits for the code to compile;
                                 It takes  a while...

                    Crashes the system and loses 6 hours of work;
                                  Feels like a jerk.

               Wiping the crumbs off the keys as he types in the code;
                                  Nothing will load.
