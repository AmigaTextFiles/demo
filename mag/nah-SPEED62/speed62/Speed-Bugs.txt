If you are running Picasso96 on a gfx board, Speed may run in NTSC mode,
which means you won't be able to see the panels. The only way to properly
avoid this is to boot with no startup sequence (+ setpatch).

On Mr Tickle/DKG's Amiga (A4000 060 CV64/3D), Speed sometimes messes up
bigtime (the pointer doesn't appear, etc.) This can also be fixed with
a no startup sequence boot.
