Amiga Scene - FreaksAmiga Scene - Freaks
 
What is a freak?
Beware: this is serious fun!
 
Over 99% of all freaks are male. It is not exactly clear if female freaks exist. 
Neither are there female celebrities in the scene, nor have we heard legends 
about such. The question why freaks are male has not been answered. There is no 
evident explanation. Interestingly, many of the freak's typical characteristics 
are not very male at all. 

Freaks are independent thinkers. To build their point of view they rely on their 
own mind instead of on what "important" people say.

Freaks have many friends, yet the usually don't go out much and if they do, they 
only meet other freaks to go to the cinema or mc donalds.

As opposed to common legends, most freaks hate beer, they even hate pubs. Some 
smoke but most do not.

They think that sports is boring loss of time.

They love electronic technoid and rahter independent music like Yello and 
everything between DM and Front 242. Melancholic music attracts them, yet most 
are not really depressive and like having fun.

They love cool technoid design. Their preferred colour is black.

They love fantasy books like Lord of the Rings, Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's 
Guide to the Galaxy and so forth.

They love Star Trek and admire the coolness of Mr. Spock.

Many are collectors. They collect everything from Star Trek items to contacts.

Freaks are very curious. What they like most is to be first to discover 
something new. Freaks are often pioneers and vice versa.

Most freaks are good guys with high ideals of a better world. They help the weak 
and fight the bad, even if it is only inside their head. They would not harm 
anybody.
They usually do not have a girlfriend even though many are longing for love and 
adventure. As soon as they finally reach it, they turn into someone new and stop 
being a freak.

Why do freaks not have girlfriends?
  The freak does not have time for a girlfriend. 
  He is too shy to impress girls. 
  He is too good. This makes the girl doubt he can protect her. 
  He is not attractive because 
  a. he does not have money
  b. the girl cannot explain to others what he is really doing
  c. his celebrity is not "real" outside the freak community
  d. he does not go to places 
  The girl rejects him because he is not really willing to admire her. (For that 
  she would have to be a better freak than he himself.) 
Some people would say freaks are geeks. But these guys are ignorant lamers and 
have no idea what they are talking about. Yet there is some truth related: 
freaks have remained children and are not really mentally grown up.
 
(The author of this text has known over 60 freaks and another 100 freakoid guys. 
Some of them he was able to watch for over 10 years.)
