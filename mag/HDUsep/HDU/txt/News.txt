	SOME NEWS FROM AMIGA WORLD - SEP97
==================================================

Pinball Brain Damage.

You may remember this game from a news item I done on this
game a few months ago.  Well since then quite a few things 
have changed.  The biggest of which has to be that Vulcan will 
no longer be publishing the game, instead, it will now be 
published by APC&TCP.  They have now released some new 
details on the game. The game will include Hi-Res table 
graphics (640x256) with 256 colours in normal mode and 
Super-Hi-Res (1280x512) in multiball mode.  The highest
resolution ever used in a Amiga pinball game and probably 
any Amiga game.  The multiball mode is promised to be the 
best so far.

The game will include many different modes with animations
and soundtracks to fit the theme of each table.  The game 
will also incoporate Pseudo 3D table rendering, which promices
to make the game even more realistic.

It will require an AGA Amiga with 2Mb Chip RAM and either a 
Hard-drive ( For the Disk version ) or a CD-ROM ( For the CD 
version ).

One other thing that is worth mentioning is that the CD-ROM 
version will include a table editor so you can make your own 
tables.  This is something that has been talked about before 
but never actually done, it will be very interesting to see if the 
programmers can pull this one off.

The game should be getting a Disk and CD-ROM release towards 
the end of the year.

====================================================
Guildhall CD Releases.

Some exciting comes from Guildhall Leisure regarding there 
future Amiga plans.The long-time Amiga publisher in co-operation
with Epic Marketing will be bringer a number of Amiga CD-ROMS 
to the highstreet.

Game, HMV and Electronics Boutique will now be stocking a 
range of Amiga CD-ROM's.  The games in these plans include 
Formula One Grand Prix, Theme Park, Dune 2, Super Skidmarks 
as well as a few others.

They will also be releasing Cililization CD.  This will include 
both the AGA and ECS versions of the game, both playable 
from the CD.  This is an excellent game that everyone should have, 
anyone that has played the multiplayer FreeCiv over the Internet 
will love the original Civilization.

On top of this they will also be releasing a re-hashed version 
of Gloom.  It will be called Gloom 3 and will consist of the original 
Gloom Deluxe engine as well as a multitude of extra levels and 
utilities for the game ( see more in special article ).

================================================
Gloom 3

I'm sure many of you have played at least one of the Gloom 
series of games.  It is considered by many to be one of the best 
Doom clones on the Amiga. Hopefully, with the addition of Gloom
3 to the series this good reputation will continue.

It may seem odd to some of you that Gloom 3 has actually arrived 
on the Amiga considering Black Magic (The original programming 
team) have long since quit from programming for it.  Well, it goes 
something like this.  Gloom 3 isn't actually from Black Magic, it is 
instead, from a new company called Alpha Software. They decided 
that since Gloom was such a good game it was worth another 
release, this time, however, instead of coming on disk the game 
will be on CD-ROM ( standard these days )

The game engine which is used is virtually identical to the Gloom
Deluxe engine.The improvments to the game have come in other 
areas.  For example, Gloom 3 will include 50 new levels, spanning 
over 7 stages!!  There will also be around ten new nasties included 
the game, with all new GFX and sound.

The game will also improve the fun for multiplayer games. There 
will be 30 new 2-player combat levels included, which will also 
contain zombies to make things that bit harder.  Modem support 
will also be improved with a much wider range of modems being 
supported.

To run the game at a decent speed you will require a decent 
spec Amiga. Although you can actually run the game on a base 
A1200, it will be slow in all but the smallest of screenmodes.  
To get a decent game out of it, it is reccommended that you have
 at least an 030 with 4Mb FAST.  To play the game in the 1x1 
screenmode an 040/060 is recommended. 
 
As is the trend with a lot of recent games graphic card owners 
will not be left out.  The game will support GFX cards allowing 
you to play the game in extremally high resolutions.  You will 
also be able to play the game in a workbench window, although 
this isn't recommened unless you have a very powerful Amiga.

The game will be released by Guildhall Leisure and Epic 
Marketing, hopefully in time for Christmas.

===================================================
Whats Out in September?

September looks as though it will be a good month for games 
releases.  The following games are set for release in this month :

Strangers AGA (Vulcan; picture) - An excellent looking Renegade like 
beat-em-up that was due in late August, but hasn't arrived yet.  
It is certain to come out early September, delays have been due to 
duplication problems, but these have hopefully been sorted out 
now.  This will be Vulcans first CD release, so it is quite a big step for
them.  The game boasts many features such as allowing 6 players to 
play at once, 32 fighters all with there own intelligence, a massive
range of moves and much more.  Certainly one to look out for.

Uropa² - the Ulteria Colony (Vulcan) - Another CD release by Vulcan. 
This is an excellent isometric adventure/vector shoot-em-up.Was 
released as Shareware earlier this year but was quickly picked up 
by Vulcan for a commercial release. Will contain amounst other 
great things some excellent sampled speach.  The shareware 
release was excellent and hopefully, Vulcan will have made 
improvments that will make it an all round better game.

Trapped 2 (Oxyron) - The follow-up to the not too well received 
Trapped.  A 3D RPG with some excellent graphical effects 
Although the game uses a Doom type engine that game is far
different and from what I can tell from the latest demo released this 
is going to be an excellent game, probably the best Doom/RPG 
game of the year.  I suggest you all try the demo for this game.
The game is in meantime allready out ( in Germany and continental
Europe ). SUPERB GAME !!! YOU MUST SEE THAT ONE !!!

Sixth Sense Investigations (Epic Marketing) - An adventure 
in the mould of the old LucasArts games.  A demo was recently
available on the CU Amiga/Amiga Format coverdisks.  Didn't look 
too bad, but certainly didn't, in my opinion come anyways near the 
classic Monkey Island series.  Maybe I will be proved wrong....

Sword (Titan Computers; picture) - A platform game that not 
many people seem to know about.  Looks quite nice, there will 
be both a disk and CD-ROM release of this one.  A game along the 
line of Rick Dangerous is what this is, very smooth with nice 
graphics.  A game that brings back the memories of the old days 
when every other Amiga game was a platformer, this however, looks
like it could beat all of them.  NOTE: Disk version already out in 
continental Europe. The Disk version (Which will be ECS and AGA) 
will be released in October ( GB ), with the CD-ROM version (AGA 
only) coming in early December.

Hover Bomber (Aurora Works) - This is a Bomberman game 
with a difference. Instead of just copying the old formula, Aurora
Works have brought it up to date.  Instead of being restricted to
laying you bombs in a grid format you can place them anywhere
you want.  The game features some excellent graphics from
the well known graphic artist Eric Schwartz.  It also sports a four
player option, something that is made even better by the fact that 
TCP/IP support is featured.  Could be the game of the month..
