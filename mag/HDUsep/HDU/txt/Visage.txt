Requires: OS 3.0

Visage is an IFF ILBM/JPeg/PNG/Datatypes viewer 
for the AmigaOS version 3.0 and higher. Main features
include:

* Supports AA (AGA), ECS, RTG, PCHG, SHAM and CLUT. ;)

* Can display "deep" pictures in all formats on ECS Amigas, rendered
   in HAM, "normal" color or grayscale.

* Can scale "rendered" pictures to fit the screen.

* Extensive monitor support. Uses a BestModeID()-like function to
   find a suitable mode (if needed).

* Any native Amiga screen mode can be specified with text! No numbers
   needed. But you can use numbers, if you so wish. Or a requester.

* Simple promotion of pictures to any installed monitor. No hardcoded
   command line options for this. There is even a monitor requester.

* Several slideshow options, including a random mode, making Visage
   ideal for use with screen blankers as an external module.

It's free!

Installation notes:

If you wish to start the installer from the Shell, please use 
the provided ShellInstall script. It sets the parameters correctly.

Also, note that the automatic language selection doesn't 
completely work with all versions of the Installer.
