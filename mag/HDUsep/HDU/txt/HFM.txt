HFMounter (shortly HFM) is a graphical frontend for the 
diskette simulating  'fmsdisk.device'. You may take any harddisk
and use (emulate) up to 12 diskettes on  it. The HF-Units could 
nicely be used f.e for unpacking DMS-Archives  onto your 
harddisk. It is based on the 'fmsdisk.device' by Dave Jones ©1996!

The units HF0: to HF11: are a full Diskette-Replacement. All 
functions, beside Booting, of a normal Diskette; HF Units take
advantage of them.
