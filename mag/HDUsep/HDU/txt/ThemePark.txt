Short:    040 enhancer for ThemePark AGA
Author:   Gareth Murfin ( gazy@globalnet.co.uk )

INFO : This is a patch for ThemePark  which will get the most out
of an A1200/4000 fitted  with an 040 and FPU or simply just an 040. 
It uses all Icaches & Dcaches available to make the game run as 
fast as possible. It was designed with an Apollo 1240/25 in  mind
but Im sure it  will work with many other setups which include an
040 CPU.

INSTALLATION : Simply copy the file go040 and CPU into the dir 
you have ThemePark  installed in  and reboot. Hold down both mouse
buttons, and select boot with no startup sequence. Now cd your way 
to the dir with go040 in, example, for me its ->

cd A500:ThemePark/TP/

Then Type go040 and simply wait. ThemePark should load up into 
glorious SuperFast 040 mode. The music might be a bit dodgy 
(faster) and the pointer strange (bug?) but it should work perfectly
normally & around 2000% faster than it would on a stock A1200 ;).
Files are in the Prg/ThemePark040 directory.

Tested on A1200Tg 040/25/25 +18meg Ram + 2xCD, 520Hd......
