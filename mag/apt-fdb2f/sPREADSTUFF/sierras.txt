OKi

As most of you know, sierra (makers of the great adventure games such as
leisure suit larry, space quest, kings quest etc) have dropped the amiga
in their future developments. One reason for this, was the fact that ami
didn't support 256 colors, so the future releases from sierra were all a
256 color based games that amiga couldn't handle. Anyhow, who cares what
the reason is? The fact is today most amiga owners have atleast an 020 &
2mb ram or more, so the new sierra games could easily be ported over for
the amiga. What the main reason for this text, is to encourage ALL amiga
owners (who enjoy sierra adventure games) to help, be a part of a letter
that i am sending to sierra usa, to ask them to release amiga games. The
reason why i need supporters is so sierra can see that there is infact a
market for their games on the amiga. Just imagine kings quest 7 on amiga
AGA 256 colors, doublepal configureable. It will be a direct port from a
pc machine. Well if your willing to support sierra in future releases on
amiga please email the following information:

Real Name - Email Address
<AMIGA0000, 000 00MHZ, 00MB RAM, 0000MB HD, x0 CD-ROM>

eg.

Edward Hamer - hamer@devil.net.se
<AMIGA1200, 040 25MHZ, 18MB RAM, 3000MB HD, x4 CD-ROM>

simple enough? If you want to see sierra return to the amiga? Then email
this short information to the following address:

'coza@bluesky.net.au'

My goal is to reach a few thousand supporters, so your support is NEEDED!

COMEON IF YOU LIKE SIERRA DON'T MISS OUT, BE A SUPPORTER OF THIS LETTER!!
