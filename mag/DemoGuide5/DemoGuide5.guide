@Node "Words" "Some words from the editor"

Well, then it happened! The Guide is on-line! After I've been writing with
RockDaZone/Artwork for a couple of weeks or so we agreed that he could
distribute The Demo.Guide on the net. It is located as a "sub-site" of
the Generation page (you know, Artwork's popular mag) as it is a
collaboration between RockDaZone and @{" I " link "DRD"}.
And just as important, maybe even more important: DareDevil joined the
TDG-crew, which means that we are now two writers instead of just one (me).
That again means that The Demo.Guide should be able to be released
regularly (hopefully!), and that more new demos are included (even though
that doesn't seem to be the case for this issue I guess). Anyway, a big
warm welcome to DareDevil, and at the same time a request to other Sceners
to join the crew and share all the fame and glory that follow :)!
Another important thing is that I've recently moved, so if you want to
contact me by snail-mail or visit me look @{" here " link "DRD"} to get the new address.
Also, I've gotten myself a lousy job, resulting in less time for Scene
stuff, therefore DareDevil has timed his entrance very well, I hope to put
some of all the work on his shoulders!
Also RockDaZone has written some reviews, originally meant for Generation
where they have been distributed before, but that doesn't stop me from
bringing them here (in a slightly change version).

This issue is released at The Party 7 before the demo compo, but if I can
get my hands on some of the new releases I'll maybe make a special Party
version, but I'm far from sure about that...

Finally I want you to inform you that I've changed my handle a bit, that is
I've removed the "Dr.", so now my handle is just Dreyer!

                                                        Greetings,
                                                       @{" Dreyer " link "DRD"}

 And remember: Spread the word... And the Guide!

@Node "Editors" "Info on the editors"

A little info on the editor:

Dreyer
------

Name: Dreyer (!)
Handle: Dreyer (!!)
Age: 19
Birthday: 13. Feb. 1978 (a Friday!)

Group: Blasphemy (PeeCee), working on finding an Amiga group
Ex-group: .sPOOn. (very briefly)
Task: Musician, Main-editor of The Demo.Guide
Famous productions: The Demo.Guide
Biggest succes: No. 3 in the music compo at The Summer Party '96
                (12 competed...)

Biography:
Born in Copenhagen in 1978, moved to Århus three years later, the place
I've been living from then untill now. I went to public school for ten
years, joined the highschool 1994 (I guess) and was finished three years
later. For a couple of month afterwards that I was unemployed (lots of time
for the Scene!), but my money was about to disappear, so I've recently
gotten a job at a printing house (I'm the one doing the dirty work...).

Scene story:
In 1988 or '89 I bought an A500 with some programs, games and joysticks
(and of course a TV-modulator), and a couple of years later I made my first
ugly tunes, I remember I used Sonix for a short period of time, but as so
many others I ended up with a lot of trackers, ending with ProTracker 2.3d.
Before that I played the keyboard which I still do, and that have become
very handy when composing mods. Usually I first play the chords on
keyboard, then tracking them and so on. In 1995 (more or less) I joined
Blasphemy, some guys I met at highschool was about to make a group, they
needed a musician. Unfortunately a PeeCee group, but...
I joined .sPOOn. sometimes afterwards (as double-member), but they died
shortly after.
Last year I bought an A1230 with some extra RAM and a HD, which was the
ideal computer for the Scene which had gone AGA a long time ago.

The Demo.Guide:
Early this year (as far as I remember) The Demo.Guide was born. I started
reviewing the demos found on my HD, then trying to get hold of as many
other demos as possible. NoName/Sector 7^Haujobb was at the same time about
to make a @{" demo CD " link "DemoCD"}, and as he liked The Guide he wanted to include it on the
CD. I travelled to Germany to visit him (back then he was a complete
stranger) and there I got _a lot_ of demos! I haven't made my way through
them yet, far from I'm afraid. But I'm working on it...


I hope to have DareDevil's (our new editor), biography in the next issue!

@Node "why" "Why did I do it and with what?"

Demos have always fascinated me. Since I saw my first demo I've wanted
to make my contribution to The Scene. So now I'm musician and editor of
this guide. Hope you like it! I think that The Scene people need a place
to look when searching for a demo. Or to see what the average Scener
think about their productions (me!).

I don't want to hurt or offend anyone, so don't take it personally if I say
that your demo sucks - that's just the way it is :-). I guess that most of
the demo makers out there agree that they can actually get better.

All demos were tested on my A1230/40Mhz with a '882 FPU running at 33Mhz.
Furthermore 8 MB of fast-RAM and 5.7 GB HD.

It's quite a job to make this guide, so if you want to help me you are
welcome to @{" contact me! " link "DRD"}
Also if you have suggestions, demos that are not in this guide, comments,
etc. or if you disagree in something or find some eRroRS @{" contact me! " link "DRD"}
If you send me demos, etc. I will probably greet you in later versions of
this guide. I cannot guarantee that I'll send back your discs (or what is
might be that you send)! Anyway: Please contribute!
Do not try to edit this guide yourself! Contact me and I'll do it for you!

@Node "HowRate" "How the demos are rated"

In this issue I'm the only one that has rated the demos. As I'm not in
any real group, not bribed and is a quite honest person I promise you to
rate the demos after what I hear and see, not who have made it!
The rate is both for the visual (code, graphic and design) and the audio
(the music and/or sound effects, and the timing to the rest of the demo).
I try not to judge from my personal likings, but this is a quite difficult
task, so you're very welcome to give me you're opinion(s) concerning the
demos in general and/or a specific demo or more. If you do so it will give
the rating a more precise value of what people think about a production.
The only things I want you to when you rate a demo is:

1) You have to have seen the demo yourself! I want your opinion from you,
   and others' opinion from themselves! Not the other way around :-)!
2) Don't judge a demo by the name of the demo or by the group who made
   it! An unknown group can also be able to make a great production!
3) Don't judge the demo on one or two categories only, there's a lot to
   think about: The code, graphic, music, design, timing, length, variation
   etc.
4) Is the machine that is running the demo a wild animal or is it just an
   "ordinary" Amiga? Of course the routines look fastest on the fast
   machines, please consider this when rating (especially concerning the
   code).
5) Don't be blinded by the good effects, graphic or music. Rate the demo as
   an overall of the demo.
6) Be neutral.

@Node "Contribute" "How to contribute"

You can contribute in many ways: Sending me demos, reviews of demos and a
copy of the demo, error reports, your opinion about the guide, the comments
and/or the ratings, etc. Feel free to spread this guide as much as you
like! If you have any suggestions for changes please @{" contact me! " link "DRD"}
I could use some helping hands, eyes and ears (I'm a couple of years behind
schedule...), so please send some test reviews of some demos, and you might
be the next top editor!
Also if you have information that I haven't (often marked with a ?) about
release place and year and placing, who made it, etc., then tell me! "Inside
information" is very welcome too!

How to send me demos: 1) By snail-mail
                      2) By E-mail: Attach the file(s) to an E-mail. The
                         max. filesize must not exceed more than 710 KB!
                         Use LHA, LZX or ZIP.
                      3) Tell me where on The Net I can find the demo,
                         still the filesize must be under 710 KB!
                      4) Visit me! Bring your complete demo collection
                         right to my door!

+ Okay design
- Not a "real" demo, only few routines

Comment: A little production which cannot really be called a demo as there
 is only about one real routine in it, a pixel routine which isn't that
 nice. Most of the demo is made using purple colors, looks good. The start
 is good too, a vector man jumps and is frozen, then the title and group
 name appears. Also in the "demo" is a chip tune part with six small
 melodies that you can listen to. If you wanna continue the demo you have
 to press a key, this goes for the rest of the demo as well.
 All music are chip tunes, and if I'm not wrong it's the same tunes as in
 the tune part.

Conclusion: Not recommended

+ Different, good music, nice design
- A little monotone

Comment: This demo is different, it isn't what you would normally call a
 demo. Through most of the demo we follow a person walking through a party
 place. All of it has been digitized from a video recording, then packed.
 It says in the endscroller that they've made 29 MB fit on one disc!!! On the
 other hand it isn't exactly broadcast quality video, there are only few
 colors and it flicks pretty much. But it's fast! Regularly there are some
 texts and symbols shown in front of the video sequence, they are shown in
 short flashes. The music is a good piece of techno which reminds me a
 little of the theme from the film "Jaws" (directed by Steven Spielberg).
 It is timed well to the demo.
 Unfortunately the show lasts a little to long to keep one's interest,
 despite a nice design and nice changes you are bored watching the
 "movie" after a while.

Conclusion: Worth watching once! No more, no less!

+ Nice texture-plasma
- Too long and monotome. Music and graphic are below average.

Comment: A boring demo with effects that have been seen better, including a
 zoomer in a small window (a little buggy) and a pretty nice morph. The
 "Calvin & Hobbes"-plasma is very nice, though. Both Music and graphics are
 below average. The routines last too long, some of them even way too long!

Conclusion: Watch it only to see the plasma routine

Inside information: The Calvin & Hobbes-plasma routine can be used for
                    24 true color.

+ Different, pretty nice routines, good music
- In many ways it's just an enhanced (?) copy of @{" State of the Art " link "StateOfTheArt"},
  (but on the other hand that's a good one), no quit

Comment: Another one of Spaceballs' "music videos". Reminds me a lot of
 @{" State of the Art " link "StateOfTheArt"}, but still it's different.
 The demo consists of a lot of digitized and manipulated small video
 sequences showing dancing people, kanji (Chinese letters) and a few "real"
 routines. All of it is shown in a hurry, the picture is constantly
 changing into new effects. Unlike @{" State of the Art " link "StateOfTheArt"} the dancers aren't
 just shown in silhouettes, no, you can actually see the person (still
 using only few colors, though). One of the few "real" routines is a big
 cube with a small video sequence running on its sides, nice!
 The techno/house music is good and fits the demo well.

Conclusion: Highly recommended!

Note: Is considered to be the follower of @{" State of the Art " link "StateOfTheArt"} without
 officially being it.

+ Pretty nice design, some good routines
- Bad music, low resolution

Comment: Right from the start you'll notice the nice design. Transparent
 vector texts are flying around on a white background, but instead of
 showing the white background there's a nice raytraced Mankind-logo, which
 are shown when all the texts has disappeared. From here a nice change
 leads us to the title which is presented in front of a plasma routine.
 Unfortunately the resolution is so low that you can hardly read the it,
 and the plasma also suffers from the resolution. Another lowres routine
 is on: The Doom routine. Still the resolution is too low, but the nice
 textures and the routine's speed make a bit up for it. A nice little
 detail is the man that is walking around in it (I think it's a scan).
 This routines changes to a so called "lady blur", that is the Doom routine
 gets purple and pink, and gets blurred a little... Looks pretty nice, but
 is on a bit to long. I really noticed how totally weird the music is when
 the next routine came on: Some kind of plasma which flows over the screen
 in different patterns, constantly changing. They call it "bio-plasma"...
 The routine is about as strange as the music, and the music is technically
 lousy performed. So is the routine with its low resolution and quite buggy
 (but interesting) look. After some text a texture mapped spinning ball is
 shown behind a drawing of a man, after that the man and ball disappears
 and the screen is taken over by a small, slow texture mapped violin.
 Getting nearer to the end two transparent plasmas is shown above (or
 under?) each other, looks good. And finally there's some kind of zooming
 flame routine, doesn't look too good.

Conclusion: Could be a lot worse and a lot better...

+ Pretty nice design, good graphic, some nice routines
- Vector torus

Comment: The demo starts with a blast while the screen is still dark. The
 synth music starts and the names of those who've made the demo is shown. A
 very nice logo is shown afterwards, and after that the title with a simple
 vector torus flying around in front of it. Shortly after we're flying
 inside this torus, and even though it's smooth vector objects aren't
 exactly state of the art, not in 1995 either. The torus disolves and we're
 on with the next routine, a little rotating box with textures on its
 sides. On one side there's even a little effect. Besides from the size of
 the cube it's quite okay. This routine is taken over by some kind of
 plasma, a rather strange effect where circles are moved over each other
 giving a special look. Hard to explain. After a picture a morph routine
 which morphes a skull is on, but it's not very nice, seen much better.
 More morph, this time a little gouraud shaded box. The shading looks a
 little odd, though. The music changes to a silent piece of techno, which
 slowly evolves to a "normal" piece of techno. Also the effect changes,
 a kaleidoscope appears, it matches brilliant with the music and looks
 brilliant (I could look on these things for hours without getting bored!).
 The last effect is another vector object, it somehow seems to be rather
 misplaced, as if the coder had a routine too much or so.
 While the scrolltext is on the music changes to heavy rock. This demo
 contains music for most people!

Conclusion: Worth having a look at.

+ Nice intro picture
- Made in a hurry

Comment: Coded in just one month. And you can see that. The best effect,
 I guess, is a pixel tunnel, which is pretty nice, but nothing special.
 A very low resolution is used for most routines.
 The intro picture is nicely drawn (comic style), the music is typical
 demo music, average.
 And by the way: It's a dentro...

Conclusion: Needs some serious work to be done - not worth watching.

+ Okay cube
- Blitterscreen is used during a lot of the routines. Bad graphic.

Comment: Only every second pixel is used in many of the routines, which
 is rather ugly. Texture-plasma, tunnel-like thing and a cube inside a
 cube are the main contents in this demo. Last mentioned is actually quite
 nice (except for the every second pixel display), it's a cube with
 twirling faces on the sides (some sides, anyway), which is inside
 another cube with unreadable names on the sides. You are inside this cube.
 The music is a fair piece of techno, nothing special, but not bad.
 The graphic is lousy (also because of the display).
 The cube is the reason for the *+-rating.

Conclusion: Watch the cube - forget the rest.

+ Some fast routines
- Blitterscreen used for showing some effects

Comment: Starts with a pretty fast voxel landscape, after that there's some
 very blurred gouraud shaded 3D-objects (including the three classics:
 A torus,  a duck and a mask), this routine is okay, but lasts too long.
 In the background of the credits there are some stone-like spots zooming
 towards you. The credits themselves are shown with jelly letters that are
 stretched when changing into another text.
 Also to mention is a nice texture tunnel, unfortunately a blitterscreen
 display is used. The demo is timed OK to the music (or the
 other way around).

Conclusion: Everything in this demo have been seen better before.

+ Original
- Everything could have been made better (the code is not bad, though)

Comment: This demo doesn't win because of the code, music or graphic, but
 because of the originality. The code is fair, but could probably be
 better, and both music and the pictures are below the average (actually
 the demo/techno music is way below average). Well, let's see what it is:
 In the beginning we are flying through the universe, destination: Earth.
 The picture is constantly zooming while rotating and it looks pretty cool,
 the resolution is pretty low, though. When we reach the Earth we're flying
 to Sweden or Norway, still zooming we meet a cow and zoom into its skin!
 Cute. After that another original routine is on, something they call a
 funnel. At first it looks like an ordinary env-mapped tunnel, but then it
 starts twisting around so that you can see it from the sides. Fancy!
 The music now changes into a lousy performed flute tune, and the scenery
 to the sea. A gouraud fish is swimming around while the low-res background
 tries to keep up with it. This part isn't that great, but pretty original
 (not that I haven't seen a fish in a demo before, they are actually quite
 popular, but this one has something the others don't - I don't know what).
 The music changes back to the demo/techno music and there's a picture of
 a smiling cow. Talking about demo's pictures, it's a special style, not
 that nice I think, but like the fish there's something about it... Well,
 in front of this cow face there's a transparent circular object flying
 around, and after that another object where you can only see the
 reflections from it, not the object itself. It all ends with a scrolltext
 which uses the same ugly font as the rest of the demo.

Conclusion: Watch it because of its originality!

+ Fine phongs and other good code, good graphic and music
- Simple vector scenes, no quit

Comment: The show starts with a great picture presenting an ugly guy's face
 looking at you. Then we move on to the first routine, a quite
 disappointing one too, especially when Jamie is behind it. It's a vector
 scene, no texture mapping, no lightsources, just a plain and vector scene
 that doesn't run too well either and has some minor bugs. In front of it
 the credits are shown. The next routine on the other hand is good, it's a
 big phong ball with spikes sticking out of it. It's fast and the
 resolution is good too. Also this fullscreen routine has some small errors
 in it, but still it's very good. Afterwards it's time for some Z-buffered
 objects, mostly square balls which fly through each other as such things
 do. The next effect is a really great water effect, except for its surface
 that doesn't look like water, but its movement and waves do. Words slowly
 rises from the water, then suddenly fall back down into the water causing
 waves to... er, wave. A picture is shown for a short time, then a new
 alternative phong object is on, and it doesn't seem to suffer from any
 small bugs. And now we are with the alternative "re-runs" a new vector
 scene is on, and the Z-buffer objects too, now just bigger but not so
 many. Another picture is shown, before a metal mask that reminds me a bit
 of the old Egyptian gold masks. Some kind of lightsource is used for
 making the surface look metallic. The resolution is good, the speed too
 and this effect is actually really cool! So is the next one. A phong chess
 piece is mirrored in a very big bend phong torus running quite smooth, and
 it just looks great! This is one of the routines that are really worth
 watching twice! Down to Earth again: The endscroller is on as the last
 thing. And you discover that you can't quit the demo, so a reset is
 necessary...
 The music is a nice piece of funk. If it fits the demo is a matter of
 taste, but I think it's okay.

Conclusion: Should be in your collection!

Note: The words that are mentioned now and then in the demo is the titles of
 demos that are released later by the same crew, but not always under the

+ Good music, fast routines
- Few routines, monotone, blitterscreen display

Comment: After the group name and the title has been shown the routines
 start. Unfortunately they all use blitterscreen, which make especially
 the phongs, which there are a lot of, look grumsy. Actually there are only
 two routines in this demo, as mentioned the phong routine and a Descent-
 routine, which also uses blitterscreen. Furthermore it's "jumpy", that is
 it can't really decide if it should be where it is or at the line above or
 below, so it jumps up and down. Both this routine and the phong routine
 are pretty fast, but it's far from enough to save the demo: Two routines
 are way too little. In the end it says "a two days production", to bad
 that they didn't use two month...
 A bright spot is the music, a piece of funk. The thing that raises this
 over the ordinary mods is a brilliant use of a flute, great!

Conclusion: Besides from the blitterscreen display it all seems quite good.
 It's a bit boring during the long run, but then there's the music...

+ High quality pictures, good music, ideas and design
- Few routines, patch fucks up some routines if it runs on better than '020
  (but this has nothing to do with the demo or rating)

Comment: It starts with some very nice hi-res pictures, traced, presenting
 the demo (names, etc.). All of this is wrapped into a nice design, and not
 only the pictures are hi-res, also the small effects in between are.
 Afterwards it's time for some TV, the screen is transformed into a TV-
 screen (even if you haven't got a tuner :)), and after a short while a
 effect appears on one of the channels, a voxel landscape I guess.
 Unfortunately this effect is trashed because of a bad (?) HD-fix. But from
 what I could see this is pretty nice. Next on is a very nice fullscreen
 plasma effect really showing of AGA's capabilities, great colors!
 The zoom/rotator routine that is on afterwards are also trashed because of
 the fix, but again I guess it's nice. After a commercial break (BBS) the
 intro (that's what they call it, a two disk intro!) is, for a while,
 changed into a mini-slideshow with three great pictures shown in a row,
 one by T'vaan, one by Lowlife and one by both. The most impressive part is
 that they are drawn in hi-res using only 16 colors, still they almost look
 like photos!!! Last effect is a fullscreen rotator using blitterscreen.
 Nice and fast.
 The music is (as the title suggests) Big Time Sensuality, taken from
 Björk's CD "Debut" and then mod-ified. Axis liked it so much that they
 couldn't help using it! And it is a good tune, and then we could discuss
 wether it's fair to use anothers artist's work in one's own production...
 The tune that is played while the endscroller scrolls is pretty good too,
 it's rock/funk.

Conclusion: Recommended mostly because of the graphic

+ A very nice routine, catchy tune
- Only one routine (the one mentioned above)

Comment: This little intro (as they call it, but I would say it's at least
 a dentro) is made to celebrate Capsule's one year birthday. It only
 contains one routine, but that is on the other hand a very nice one. At
 first the only thing present is a background texture, shortly after a
 kube with this texture on zooms away from the background and starts
 spinning. Then it stops and points one of its sides towards the viewer,
 while it starts to get closer. And now the texture is a mirror that
 reflects the cube in infinity (in theory). It starts to turn around, first
 on only one axis, soom after on all axis still displaying infinity on its
 sides. Looks terrific! The tune is a very melodic and catchy chip tune,
 and I'm pretty sure that I've heard it in a PeeCee demo before. It's good
 anyway... :) The demo ends with a nice scrolltext where Capsule accuses
 other Spanish groups to be inactive and lazy... Happy birthday!

Conclusion: Watch it. It's short, but the routine is cool, so is the music!

 reaching the edge. Then three gouraud shaded boxes fly about and through
 each other. Then there's a texturemapped ball, a nice plasma and at last
 we're inside a torus with moving textures on the sides. The torus effect
 is great and so are most of the others, but this demo has no design at
 all. It's just effect after effect, which isn't that great in the long
 run.
 The only graphic are textures (I guess, I don't remember any pictures),
 and they are good.
 The music is an okay piece of techno.

Comment: Strange production this one, aimed only at '060 it seems, and the
 effects are pretty much the same throughout the demo, phongs and
 landscapes, a single tunnel is also shown, and a face with a "moving"
 surface, looks that way because of the lightsource (which you can't see).
 Almost all phong objects are terrible slow on a '030, but on the other
 hand it's not just phong objects, they're texture mapped and lightballs is
 often to find around them, blinding the spectators. The lightballs is also
 found in the 3D landscapes and the last routine, a bumpmap, are
 illuminated by multiple lightsources. The pictures in the demo are good,
 the music is a mainstream synth pop mod which is not at all timed to the
 show.

Conclusion: Might be fun to watch for '060 owners, not for anyone else.

+ Nice effects
- The changes could be better

Comment: A very nice demo, indeed! At first there's a "different" phong
 which is rather difficult to explain, so I won't try to explain it, but it
 looks very nice. While the phong is shown the credits consisting of
 zooming transparent vector letters are shown. Then there are the usual
 phong torusses, blurred, env-mapped and also some other phongs (blobs),
 one of them is a quite nice transparent, lightsourced one. In between
 some of the routines there are some flickerscreens with zooming texts
 and some pictures (that's probably design...). The second best effect in
 the demo is a silver colored tunnel. At first it looks just like an
 ordinary tunnel where you're just looking at the center wondering where
 it's gonna end, but suddenly the "camera" starts moving around so that you
 can see the tunnel's sides. It's fast and very nice, no slow routines here
 (which goes for the rest of the demo as well). The tunnel is taken over by
 another more colorful tunnel, but suddenly it zooms a little away from
 the viewer and you see that it is only one side of a cube, which contains
 three different routines on its sides: The tunnel, a rotating face and
 another twisting cube also with a picture on its sides! And it's smooth!
 This is one of the best effects I've ever seen! I wonder if it's all
 animation or what? Well, the last routine is another box, this time
 without any fancy things on its sides, but this one is kind of wall
 wrapped, that is a part of the screen is bend towards (or away) from the
 viewer while other parts of the screen are far away (or close) to the
 viewer. A kind of plasma, I guess. It all ends with another flickerscreen.

Conclusion: Sure worth having a look at!

+ Fast code, nice design, original
- The music is pretty acid-like, but I guess that's a matter of taste (as
  always), minor complaints

Comment: This demo is different from most other demos I've seen, both
 concerning design and originality. The code is splendid, fast and
 bug-free (!), and the way that they've (Juliet and Case) combined two
 rather simple effects into one, adds a completely new dimension to the
 demo. Furthermore they haven't tried to make PeeCee-like effects, that is
 very CPU-hungry routines that are nearly impossible to do on a '030 and
 below (and above?). The design is also worth mentioning. The demo runs in
 a square placed in the middle of the screen, the colors are a bit dark
 creating a good atmosphere, and some of the transistions are nice. Also
 the demo runs at a great speed, the effects are not shown for long, so you
 don't get bored watching it, even when some of the routines are shown more
 than once in different variations. For example the simple tunnel effect
 that starts the show, or the gouraud routine afterwards presenting the
 demo's title, among other things. Then the credits are shown with a
 breaking-wall effect: At first you see the credits on the screen, suddenly
 it breaks into several pieces and behind it is a new screen with more
 credits. This is followed by some kind of voxel routine, but the
 interesting part about it is the butterflies flying around above it. Very
 nice! I doubt it's a "real" voxel-routine, but that doesn't really matter
 as long as the visual is that good. Later in the demo same routine is
 used, but with two bees that fly through each other, and an animated bird.
 A flatscape is used instead of voxel when a gearwheel makes it way jumping
 across the endless flat land. A nice texturemapped flower that unfolds
 its crown is on for a short while afterwards, and is taken over by a
 picture that waves in different ways. An unsuccessful part of the demo
 must be the ball-effect, where some texture-mapped balls are moved around
 on half of the used square of the screen, while the other half is a sick
 yellow color, and the same happens later with a plasma routine. It might
 be design (but I hope not!) or an error?!
 Worth mentioning is also a 3D-scene with gearwheels doing what gearwheels
 do, a trip in a cave where columns rise from the floor to the ceiling
 and a man hitting the "camera" causing the demo to have a blackout for a
 while! It all ends with the beautiful flower that folds and unfolds.
 The music is an acid piece of rock. Sounds as if Groo gets more and more
 drunk by composing this piece!

Conclusion: A necessity!

+ Lots of nice routines, Pretty nice design, excellent graphic
- Some processor hungry routines, in the end the design seems to disappear

Comment: TBL does it again! Another great production and another winner
 demo, and as usual the design and graphic are nice, the music good
 (however, some say that it's a little monotone - a matter of taste).
 Somehow it reminds me of their previous superhit that one TG'96
 @{" Tint " link "Tint"} with the choice of colors and the nice design. Tint's
 design may be a little better, though. Well, to the demo:
 A TBL logo is flashing to something that sounds like a broken sonar. It's
 getting more and more clear. Then a galaxy is created, and shortly after
 it explodes in a flash. Looks okay (but not as nice as the one in
 Andromeda's @{" Nexus 7 " link "Nexus7"}). A nice picture by Rodney is shown.
 A nice, but a little slow tunnel routine is up next. The tunnel is
 bend. In front of it flies a plate with some of the credits written on it.
 The plate is split up into a lot of small plates which turn, so that you
 see the backside of them where more credits are shown. This routine runs
 until there are no more credits. Looks great! After that the title picture
 is shown. In the middle of this picture is a little circle with some
 colors in it, and suddenly we zoom into the circle, and keeps zooming
 and zooming discovering new hidden images! Excellent! But that's not all,
 it is changed into a 3D-tunnel with a flashing spotlight in the end. Then
 we zoom backwards and end up in a 3D-scene with a lot of TV-screens
 showing different pictures. The resolution is low, but it looks okay
 anyway. Of course (?) the "camera" turns towards one of the screens and
 the quiet techno changes to a peaceful flute tune, while the scene changes
 to a close-up picture of a skyscraper. An animated phong dolphin quietly
 passes the building and is mirrored in the big windows. The resolution is
 quite low and I guess the dolphin could have moved a little smoother, but
 it's beautiful (I wonder how they've managed to make the Dolphin fly
 :-))... Unlike previous TBL productions, which have always contained pixel
 perfect pictures, many of Captured Dreams' pictures look more like
 collages. Alternative and atmospheric. One of such pictures is shown, and
 the music changes back to techno. After the picture an animated,
 texturemapped dinosaur appears, may be a Tyranosaurus Rex. We slowly move
 around it and discover that it's a little buggy (there's a few holes in
 it) and a bit slow. The excellent changes from routine to routine which
 was in the start of the demo seems to have disappeared. They're not bad,
 though, just more simple. We fly away from the dinosaur and some kind of
 colored bumpmap appears, it's a little slow, but on the other hand there
 are five lightsources. An excellent (pixel perfect) picture by Danny and
 Louie is shown afterwards. And then we go underwater, down into the ocean.
 It's a beautiful place, and the flute tune is back. You see the bottom of
 the ocean with small hills and so on, and all over the place there are
 reflections from the sun that shines through the ocean's surface. Very
 nice indeed. Also a picture with some of the statues from Easter Island is
 shown with the same effect. Later we have a look in the direction of the
 surface, and that's one of the most realistic water effects I've ever
 seen! The next routine takes place above the ocean, it's a flatscape with
 a lightsource in the middle, and it looks OK. And then it's time for one
 of the most hardcore tunnel routines ever seen! A jelly, texturemapped,
 fast, 3D-thing with a lightsource in the end (which results in lensflares
 of course...). The "camera" freely moves around in the tunnel. Suddenly it
 sees a lightball far away and shortly after the lightball lights up the
 tunnel. Great! Getting nearer to the end we have a phong scene with
 different phong objects moving around, sometimes it's a little slow, that
 is when to much happens on the screen, but else it quite nice. The last
 effect is a traditional 3D-scene, and it's slow. What happens is that four
 or five butterflies flies around a temple. I guess you need to have a
 quite powerful processor to run this smoothly. Finally an OK picture by
 Rodney is shown, and then the dreams have been released...?

Conclusion: Great!

Note: In @{" Tint " link "Tint"} the song sounds something like "Where is
 the key that unlocks all my dreams?", it seems as if they've found the
 key! Or maybe this is just a coincidence?

- A few routines are ugly

Comment: A political demo demonstrating against the communistic government
 in the former Soviet?! Yes, it looks that way! It all starts with a screen
 that flickers with red and black colors, like peeking in the memory. In
 the bottom there's a silhouette of a city, and above it the title and
 credits are shown, followed by a short poem. Sigh :). A, I guess, Russian
 song is played to make the atmosphere right. This sequence ends when the
 screen fades to black, and shortly after the demo's main part has started.
 And what a part! I don't remember I've seen such a fast demo. The pace is
 very fast, one effect after another is thrown right in your face
 constantly, while the quite good techno music play in the background!
 Tunnels, Russian symbols and slogans, zoom/rotator routines, 3D objects
 and plasma effects are shown fast after another, sometimes combined with
 brilliant transitions, are shown repeatedly in different variations.
 And besides from a few ugly routines it looks great! After a couple of
 minutes the show ends, and so did the communism!

Comment: Another average production with mostly pretty nice routines, but
 lack of design. At first the credits are shown with a wallwrap in the
 background, and it isn't the best wallwrap I've seen but it's acceptable.
 It's taken over by a quite good bumpmap which tells us the demo's name,
 it's both fast and in a good resolution. And then the obligatory (?)
 phong, but unlike lots of other phongs these are pretty interesting:
 Flying animated mushrooms! Or is it jellyfishes? Well, no matter what they
 are they look very nice, the resolution is high, while the objects move
 smooth. Great! After that there are different kinds of tunnels and also
 another phong object. One tunnel is a plasma thing, which looks okay, then
 there's a tunnel with mountain peaks coming out of its sides (I've seen
 this one or one very similar to this one before, but, anyway, It's nice)
 and finally not just one tunnel, but two transparent on top of each other.
 This tunnel is pretty great! Near the end of the demo there's we are to
 fly around in a little spaceship in a nice 3D-scene. The ship flies
 through some torusses while it's viewed from different angles. The
 resolution is a little low, but everything (except for the background)
 moves smoothly around.
 The last routine is a green waving 3D-grid, where the lines get brighter
 when they are in front of each other - the more lines the brighter it
 gets. Too bad it is in blitterscreen, but except for that it's terrific.
 There isn't much graphic in the demo, but the passion picture in the start
 of the show is very nice. The music is a piece of laid back techno/demo
 music, pretty good and it's timed okay to the rest of the demo.

Conclusion: Worth having a look at.

+ Nice routines
- Better transitions would have been nice

Comment: I must say that I'm a little impressed - they say that this is
 their first demo, but you can't really see that. All routines are nice,
 the graphics are pretty good while the music is average, but it fits the
 demo well. I would have liked if the changes from one routine into another
 had been better instead of just always fading, though. As the title
 suggests there aren't (m)any new routines in the demo, however I wouldn't
 called it unoriginal. Instead of traditional env-mapped torusses they use
 a transparent man, while the cloudy background scrolls around, instead of
 showing an ordinary voxel landscape they show both voxel above and under
 water (nice!), instead of using just one lightsource on the bumpmap they
 use three (this is a little slow) and instead of just showing a tunnel
 they show a tunnel while the greetings flies (zooms) through it...
 One of the best routines is a picture consisting of many small pictures
 (model's faces) which is rotated, zoomed and exposed to different kinds of
 plasma, this one is great! Finally there's a fire rotation routine,
 nothing particular about it. The endscroller starts and the synth music
 with triphop drums changes into a piano/synth piece.

Conclusion: Have a look at this - you won't regret it! Almost a ****'er.

+ Nice routines, pictures and music
- Lacks design, blitterscreen display

Comment: It could have been brilliant, but as it is now it's "only" good.
 To things do that this demo isn't better than it is: It lacks design, it's
 one effect after another, there are no fancy changes or the like, which is
 to bad with an in other ways good demo. The second thing is that it uses
 blitterscreen display in almost all routines, sure it makes the routines
 run smoothly, but also it makes them look grumsy and unclear. But besides
 from that it's a well made production. Both the graphic and music is top
 class (a picture by Kube is incredible and the industrial techno module by
 Groo is marvelous (if you like that kind of music - I do!)). Well, to the
 show: At first a logo is shown with a glinsing phong thing with rubber
 arms flying n front of it. The music is still some atmospheric sounds, but
 that changes for sure when the next routine is on: A fullscreen glinsing
 env-mapped phong object. Then there are different kinds of plasma (also
 some kind of tunnel), a moving bumpmap and the before mentioned great
 picture. The credits are brilliant (and quite unexplainable), they have to
 be seen! After that a foggy, texture mapped 3D landscape appears, shortly
 after it disappears. All of the routines are shown for only a short period
 of time, which does that the demo is worth watching more than ones, you
 have to see the routines once again. More plasma is on afterwards, then a
 lot of phong balls with a pulsating background, then a bumpmapped tunnel
 (look pretty good despite the blitterscreen display). Another quite
 unexplainable effect is the next, some kind of rotator routine where a lot
 of squares a rotated. Watch it! Another phong object scene with pulsating
 background is shown as the last routine. Again the objects are env-mapped
 and moves pretty smooth, also when there are many.

Conclusion: Watch it!

 quality which goes for the rest of the pictures in the demo too (luckily
 Kazik has improved much since then!). And then we have a look at a much
 improved Workbench: A custom WB-screen with two windows running different
 effects, a pink and blue plasma and a pixel-routine. The routines
 themselves aren't impressive in any ways, but not bad either (which goes
 for the rest of the demo's effects), but it's a cute idea. Afterwards the
 plasma routine that ran in the window is shown as fullscreen plasma,
 still fast, but the resolution is a bit low. Afterwards the classic
 vectorballs are dancing across the screen, not exactly state of the art.
 Another average picture showing a future city with, among other things, a
 wall in front it is shown, the fine thing about it is that a scrolltext
 is running on the wall, original! The next couple of effects have been
 seen better before, both before and since, but I'll mention them anyway:
 A line-routine that makes a simple cone, a buggy ball with a texturemap
 scrolling around on its surface (some times the picture disappears),
 another plasma that zooms from the top of the screen and is squeezed
 towards the middle, then getting bigger as it's getting closer to the
 bottom of the screen. Finally (besides from the credits and greetings-
 parts) a dot-effect is on showing an object that morphs into other
 objects. The synth/demo-music is, like the pictures, not too good, lacks
 especially technical qualities.

Conclusion: Not recommended

Comment: This "demo" mainly consists of one part: The end scene from the
 TV-series Bottom! It is taken directly from Bottom and then converted to
 black/white. If you have never seen Bottom I would highly recommend you
 to do it! It's very funny! And so is this production. For you that have
 not yet seen it I'll explain what's going on: The two main characters are
 "dancing" and fighting... That's quite simple, but amusing. The music is

+ Some nice routines
- Low resolution during many routines, lacks design

Comment: A little unimpressive production, one of those with one routine
 after another with no real design, and no real ideas. It starts with some
 funky letters telling us the demo's name, followed by the first routine, a
 nice gouraud shaded, lava colored torus. It flies around for a while, then
 it disappears, and for a couple of seconds nothing else happens. Next one
 is a cube in "disguise", as the first thing you see is just a little
 square on the middle of the screen with a texture zoom routine running in
 it, but suddenly it shows up to be a cube with this zoom routine, and
 rotator for that matter, on all of its sides. Nice. Next up is, besides
 from a lot of text, two boxes, a normal and a long one that flies through
 each other. They are texture mapped and one of them a bit buggy. Finally
 a new gouraud routine is on. Five or six small objects in different colors
 are zoomed to the screen, later they are zoomed back were they came from.
 The music is techno, one of those pieces you won't remember the minute
 after it stopped, but the quality is okay.

- Short demo with too many 3D-objects in the end

Comment: Nice graphic, nice music, nice code! We get to know different
 kinds of shading when different shaded torusses (how original!) are shown
 one after another (flat shaded, gouraud shaded...). Pictures are shown
 between each new routine and they are excellent (some of them have
 competed in a GFX compos)! The music is a funky funk which fits well
 into the demo.
 A cube with different pictures on each side, a transparent cube with a
 picture on it and phong objects (including the duck...) are also in this
 demo. And that's that. It's short and the phong part is long.
 Too long. Too bad, since it's very well designed, and I would like to see
 more different routines designed as well as the ones shown.

 convinced people that it was almost ready during that time, but the fact

+ Some good routines, pretty nice graphic
- Some slow routines, no design

Comment: This demo was released at Absolute!'s own party, so it is a shame
 that it isn't better. Hopefully the Party was! It starts with a lot of
 text introducing the demo, including the title. This is taken over by a
 texturemapped 3D object that only rotates on the x-axis, but it is pretty
 fast. After a while the textures starts to rotate. To bad that it doesn't
 move on all three axis. Next effect is a zooming rotator, probably the
 same as on the 3D object, it's fast. The resolution is a bit low. A nice
 picture of a bodypainted lady is shown between this effect and the
 credits. When they disappear a different twirl routine is on. The
 different thing about it is that it's build from small blocks, so that
 there's a black line between every block. Unfortunately that idea isn't a
 success. Afterwards a slow cube with a picture on each side is shown.
 That's probably why the object in the beginning of the demo was only
 rotating on one axis, the code is simply to slow to handle two axis
 talking about 3D objects. It ends with a lot of greetings and texts which
 is rather boring, but fortunately you can quit it here.
 The music is a straight forward techno pop/pop thing, which could have
 been better, the quality is about the same as the demo's.

Comment: This dentro looks a bit older than it is. Most of the effects
 could be made on an A500, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are
 ugly, but they are simple. For example the starfield, which is show after
 a very nice logo, is quite beautiful. Another nice effect that is shown
 later in the demo is a shaded vectorbox in front of a fast (maybe
 precalced) tunnel. Of more average effect there are a small pixel ball
 with sticks sticking out of, a pixel tunnel that changes its shape, a
 transparent blue ball and a "walking" box. The design is okay, the music
 is ditto and timed well to the demo (but is faded in the end). It's a
 piece of synth/techno.
 I wonder why they've called it Cronos :)

+ Probably looks nice on a fast machine ('060 or the like)
- (Very) slow and few routines, crashes your system after exit

Comment: This is one of these demos made with a fast machine in mind - all
 the routines are slow on a '030, but they probably look great on '060.
 The readme-file confirms that it was actually made for '060, but runs on
 '020 too. I would say that it merely limps... It can't be hard to create a
 "fast" demo - you just need the right equipment, that's a '060, PowerPC or
 Pentium 166> :-). Well, enough about the (lack of) speed. At first a
 flying, twisting, zooming, blurred and rotating text presents the title
 and the group's name. The group is written with texture mapped letters,
 while the other texts are plain white. The demo's title is displayed (a
 graffiti picture) while a transparent phong glass flies in front of it.
 More phong, this time with ordinary texturemapping and then the slowest
 texturemapped 3D-scene I've ever seen. Almost as sad to watch as to see a
 PeeCee demo running on a '486 or a slow Pentium... The last routines
 (except for the scroller, which is actually also a routine) are three
 phong torusses with something that looks like shining fog flying above it.
 Pretty hard to explain and imagine, but it's pretty nice. The torusses
 disappear and the "fog" starts to rotate making circles on the screen.
 Then there's the endscroller. The text is bumpmapped and behind it is a
 tunnel. And guess what: It's not very smooth...
 Finally it crashes your system shortly after it exits...

Conclusion: Only for the owners of '060 or better. Maybe a fast '040 would
 be enough (if it runs on such a thing).

+ Runs smooth and fast, great 3D
- Some effects are below average and/or very old, Escom is greeted (!)

Comment: The first thing you'll notice about this demo is probably the
 speed that the routines are shown with. All effects last for only few
 seconds (tops) and then changes into a new one. It looks as if it's a mix
 of new and old routines, some are very simple, some a little more advanced.
 I like the way that some 3D-animations are used, they look great: The
 screen is filled with the same little animated 3D-object placed in rows.
 A short fullscreen animation of an armored knight looks great too (?).
 What I also like about this demo is that all of the effects run smoothly,
 the coders haven't tried to make routines that are too demanding for
 the machine (maybe they are on old Amigas?).
 The graphics are good (especially a picture by Lazur that is shown both
 as fullscreen and in a zoom routine).
 The music is a noisy piece of techno which fits well into the demo,
 furthermore it's timed to the effects. The endtheme is a quiet piece
 which is played while a Star Wars scroller tells us who made this possible
 (except for Amiga). Excellent.
 Worth noticing is that Escom and Petro is greeted!

Conclusion: Watch it! Great mixture of good and old! Especially for
 nostalgists and speed freaks!

Inside information:
 - Cyberlogik was a very unexpected release because that
   Alcatraz had said that they would cut down on divisions from other

 - In fact there's a lot of mess with the name Alcatraz, but the main-

 - The routines (more than 30) was written in only four weeks!
 - Some music CD's containing Scene music is called Cyberlogik and is made
   by Alcatraz Entertainment Software.

- Low resolution

Comment: Containing 3D-scenes, textureplasma (both a transparent 2-layer
 one and one with a lightsource), a water routine and a 3D-tunnel.
 Especially a transparent 3D-scene with animated thinking statues looks
 quite nice. The colors in the routines are bright (darkside?) in
 opposition to the nice, hand drawn pictures. Last to mention is the great
 music. It's not some traditional techno or demo-music, it's more like film
 music which is timed to the demo. Great!
 A minus in the demo is that the resolution is a little low in most of the
 routines, and you'll need a pretty fast CPU to make it all go smoothly.

+ Some well coded routines
- Both music and graphic are below average, some routines need lots of CPU
  power

Comment: One of the first things you notice about this demo is the rather
 primitive graphic and the "dance-pop-from-the-radio"-sound that flows out
 from speakers (of course with a woman's voice included...). The sequence
 where the demo is introduced consists of primitive logos and ditto
 backgrounds. But after the start it begins to look better (if you ignore
 the graphic put in here and there). A bumpmapped 3D-object that is put
 together from some boxes appear, it's both fast and nice, and the
 resolution is good. But it gets even better when this object disappears
 and a glass that is also bumpmapped enters the screen followed by three
 small bumpmapped and texture mapped objects. These three objects fly
 around the glass and are mirrored in it. Really good! Also the next effect
 is nice, a fast voxel routine running in 1x1 resolution. The catch is that
 it's shown in a matchbox format, and a matchbox isn't big! Well, maybe it
 is more the size of a small cigar-box on a 14" monitor, but anyway...
 Talking about boxes: A box is on as the next routine, not an ordinary box,
 not a magic box, but a texture mapped box where you only get to see one of
 its sides one at a time. The texture is a picture of a face, and suddenly
 the face starts to get out of the box, looks as if you take a piece of
 plastic and press it against your face (by the way don't! It's very
 dangerous! :)). It's one of the better routines of its kind, very nice!
 Before the next routine a Dali-like picture is shown, and actually this is
 not bad at all, unlike the rest of the graphic! Then there's a small 3D-
 scene starring a phong silver cat that sits in the middle of a room with
 patterns on the walls. The "camera" is pointed towards the cat all the
 time, no wild flights here, but that's maybe the best as the routine need
 a fast processor to run well! But besides from that it's fine. Also the
 next routine is some kind of minor 3D-scene. It is taken place on the
 bottom of the sea where three bumpmapped fish swim around above a voxel
 landscape, and like the previous routine this needs a powerful CPU.
 The demo ends with a horizontal scrolltext that follows the surface of
 picture that is below it, cute...

Conclusion: If just the rest was as good as the code is, but it isn't...

+ Some nice routines, good graphic
- Generally low resolution

Comment: The show starts with a kaleidoscope effect (a lot of colorful
 patterns) with cycling colors, these are always nice. A texture plasma is
 on as the next where the texture is some ladie's face, how original. By
 some reason only very few colors are used, and combined with the low
 resolution, which is a characteristic for many of the later effects. On
 the other hand it's fast, but that doesn't save it. Suddenly it is zoomed
 away from the screen, and you discover that it was just one side of a cube
 that now turns and zooms back towards the screen with a new effect, a
 twirling colorful tunnel. Later it stops twirling, the tunnel is still
 running, though, and a strange shaded box enters the screen through the
 wall. Except for the low resolution it looks good. A picture is shown
 next, a nice one too, and in front of it flies a little transparent
 symmetric object that causes the picture to be a bit displaced. After this
 routine that was different from most of the other routines as it was in
 a good resolution, the techno/jungle changes to a similar piece, and the
 effect changes to another tunnel, but this one with mountains coming out
 of its sides. Unfortunately it's ruined pretty much, especially because
 of the resolution, but also its colors and speed aren't my favorites.
 Next routine is a bit unexplainable, but anyway I'll try to do my best:
 First of all it's bumpmapped, second a zooming box that is slowly zooming
 towards the viewer and is exposed to this bumpmap effect (without being
 bumpmapped itself) causes an area around the box to be painted with the
 box's color, this paint gets bumpmapped. Hmm, I guess you have to see it
 to get the idea. And better bring the fast processor for the purpose, it's
 a pretty slow routine, but on the other hand the resolution is quite good.
 3D objects have been seen many times before, and the one that is on next
 is no exception. This one is gouraud shaded or something similar and
 morphes into different objects. Still it's not exactly state of the art.
 After a picture a low-res doom routine is on, pretty fast, very colorful
 and it's lightly blurred too. The demo ends with this routine without
 having reached a higher goal, but also without being a total failure. All
 in all it's actually okay.

Conclusion: Recommended

Comment: As the title suggests this is a remix of the demo @{" Deep " link "DeepCNCD"}, and I
 must recommend you to read that review if you want to know the details for
 the routines in this demo. Except for the very talented Kube the team
 behind this production is the same, most of the routines are too, but
 there are some new ones that surely are worth mentioning. The first
 routine for example wasn't in the original demo, but anyway it's nice.
 It's a waving 3D field with cycling colors slowly spinning around. The
 next couple of routines are from the original demo (tunnel with mountains
 sticking out of its sides, a variation of the kaleidoscope routine,
 texture plasma, a colorful Doom routine and a picture with a big
 transparent, blue blob in front of it). Something that is not in the
 original is the part of models that are spread randomly throughout the
 demo, some times put together to bizarre "creatures", if you could say
 that about models. Also the pretty, fast env-mapped phong routine, and a
 rather slow, but beautiful party twister is newcomers. One of the last
 routines is one of the old, a twisting, colorful tunnel.
 The music is a pretty noisy piece of techno, doesn't sound too nice, but
 fits the show okay.

 that these two ugly, primitive guys are talking nonsense. Their speech is

 is that it's just as un-understandable to me as if it was Polish or

+ Fast routines, pretty nice design, some original ideas, nice pictures
- The resolution is generally not good (but acceptable)

Comment: Yet another of LED's fast phong filled demos. This time the
 environment is the future: All backgrounds look technical, there's a scene
 with ED-209 (the evil robot from Robocop) and the techno music combined
 with the rest of the demo make a very futurist atmosphere. Also two good
 pictures by MRK help it on its way.
 The demo's name is shown with shaking letters and is taken over by the
 colored bumpmapped credits that are shown in a small band across the
 screen. A cartoonish drawing of an angry astronaut is shown, which is
 nice, but I think it doesn't fit too well to the rest of the demo. Then
 the "real" routines start: A fast voxel landscape. You're flying over it
 looking down at it obliquely so that you rarely see the horizon. And
 sometimes the "camera" even makes a 360° rotation. And then to the phong:
 It's fast, the resolution is a little low (but acceptable), but in overall
 nice. Behind the object (which you can't see what is) a technical
 background moves around. Then it's time for some kind of 3D-scene. The
 ED-209 robot (or one very similar to it, anyway) is walking lightened by a
 spotlight from above. It is of course texturemapped and we see it from
 about all angles as we fly around it. Nice and pretty smooth. After that
 there's a not completely normal tunnel (looks like a plasma tunnel). First
 of all it twists and wrenches, and second small phong blobs zoom towards
 you without being slow! More phong: The technical background is back on,
 the phong too, this time it morphs (even though it has some problems
 morphing back to it original state, but I think this is design). The next
 routine which takes over where the other ends is pretty original. It's a
 texturemapped box (wow, that sure is original!). The cool thing about it is
 that suddenly a red laserbeam starts cutting in it, so that the textures
 is marked with dark burns! And finally we have reached the last routine
 which is also pretty original. The technical background is still on, a new
 phong object is on (wow, that sure is original!). But there's also a
 technical foreground which is made with a lot of holes in it, so that you
 can still see what's happening behind it (if these holes haven't been
 there this routine could have been a bommer :-)). And that's not all. The
 light source is placed in front of the foreground, so you can see the
 shadows from it on the phong object! Great! And then it's over.

Conclusion: Watch it!

+ Magnificient show!
- Needs a powerful CPU

Comment: This one was one of the top candidates to win the Assembly demo
 compo, in my opinion it's at least as good as the winner @{" Sumea " link "Sumea"}, but
 then again you can't really compare those two as it is two different
 styles. The other one won as you can see above, probably because of its
 originality and it's less processor hungry nature. The resolution is now
 and then a bit low, but the routines are smooth so that you don't really
 notice that. Anyway, let's get on with the review.
 First of all: It's a long demo, but that doesn't mean that it becomes
 monotone, the Mellow Chips have succeded in making it interesting from the
 start to the end. The coders are fund of colorful phong routines, small
 flying lightballs and blur effects here and there on most of the routines
 (last mentioned also partly hiding that it needs a rather fast CPU).
 Also the colorful backgrounds are a mark of this demo and for the Chips in
 general. The first thing that happens after you start the demo is that a
 metallic voice counts down to from five, when reaching zero the demo
 starts for real with a good syntheziser piece of music that through the
 demo changes from being real music to just some floating sounds. What
 happens on the screen is that a plane with long tails of bright smoke
 behind it takes off, the smoke actually causes the background picture to
 be brighter where the smoke is (must be environmental compatible plane!
 :-)). It shortly after shows to be a space craft as it flies towards a
 big brown planet. The crew's name is the next thing that is on, not just
 with an ordinary still-picture, also with 3D. The letters fly one by one
 towards you with a tail of blur behind them, when they reach the screen
 they disappear so that you can see the letter behind them. Nice! The
 credits are shown in a space scene with stars, lensflares, etc. The next
 routine is a blurred voxel landscape with lightballs flying around, the
 blur gives them a long bright tail. The sun that is partly hidden behind
 a hill sometimes the screen get almost completely white, a nice detail.
 Up next is a colorful tunnel with where a texture mapped space craft
 suddenly enters and makes it all a bit more interesting, and lightballs
 in different colors are flying through the tunnel at the same time.
 The next routine is especially brilliant, still it's 3D, and it's phong
 and it's for sure inspired by the movie Terminator 2 - Judgement Day,
 to be more explicit the scene where the T1000 has disguised himself as the
 checked floor in the asylum and then transforms into the guard. It's the
 same thing that happens here, except that we only get see first half of
 the process (only half of the body gets up before next effect), and that
 it isn't exactly a complete floor, but a plate that we slowly fly around.
 It's phong, it's morphing, it's hungry, but so cool! Afterwards a bumpmap
 morph routine is on. Words are slowly morphed out of a transparent plate,
 with the obligatory lightballs in the background, and when one word fades
 out the other word fades in at the same time. It's almost to much with
 these lightballs and the mess with the colors, but it sure is impressive.
 The next effect is actually quite ordinary, except for the heavy blur that
 has been added to it: A box is spinning around and changing its color, and
 the tale behind is therefore a rainbow of different colors. Also the next
 routine is a variation of a well-known one, the water routine where
 everyhing is seen from above and invisible objects causing the water to
 wave behind them. The idea is the same, but they've replaced the water
 with jelly! A new little 3D-scene follows afterwards, an object consisting
 of a floor, four columns, a reversed pyramid as roof and a big ball in the
 middle that looks quite electric inside. Next effect really proves that
 they have been watching Terminator 2, they've made a fire effect where the
 bottom of the screen is on fire, the flames are rising high, and through
 them is the head of a metal terminator (with red eyes of course) zoomed
 towards you, it doesn't stop untill you've looked it deep in the eyes!
 The demo now changes to being a bit more humoristic, as the next thing
 that happens is that a little animation is shown, where two men are about
 to shoot each other in a duel, one of them is quite normal, the other
 equipped with strange cartoonish stuff. And then there's a commercial
 brake! A total style change, and I can't really decide if it's good or
 bad, one thing is for sure: It doesn't fit in here (that's a little bad).
 The commercial itself is a picture of some junkfood with MC written on
 the packing, and a commercial voice saying some words... And after this
 commercial a picture of a dead man is shown! The next part is the
 greetings part, but as anything else this is different from most other
 demos. A rotating texture as background, a texture mapped object as
 middleground and the greetings as foreground. Very nice indeed. The next
 scene is one of my favorite scenes, a futuric city, blurred with texture
 mapped buildings. We're flying around above the city looking down at the
 successful texture maps, enjoying the view. A traced picture with the
 demo's name is shown afterwards, and a short endscroller ends the demo.

Conclusion: Highly recommended, especially for people with fast processors!

Inside information: The main coder Braindead has been accused for writing
 this demo in AMOS, which he partly denies. Some of the code was actually
 written in AMOS Pro 2.0, but all the "heavy" tasks were coded in
 assembler. This is the last demo from Braindead that use AMOS as base-
 language, the new ones use C and assembler, not because of the critisism,
 but because of some AMOS bugs.

+ Great 3D-scenes, nice graphics
- Needs lots of CPU power to run smoothly.

Comment: 3D-scenes are the main contents of this demo. After a short
 credit and title sequence (nice graphics, good film like music) the show
 starts for real: The letters MC are shown in a "room" with round checked
 walls, which is mirrored in the letters. It runs perfectly smooth, and
 you don't see that the resolution is a little low (I saw it, though...).
 In this part, and almost in the rest of the demo, the music is a fine
 piece of techno. After that there are some env-mapped objects, then
 there's a tunnel with a lightsource at the end of it, this part needs a
 powerful CPU! Actually, most of the routines need a powerful CPU to run
 smoothly, but most of them run acceptable on a 1230-40 or 50.
 Later there's a very nice picture by Jogi which is "twisted" and
 stretched, looks a (very) little like when you throw a stone in a pool
 of water.
 Then we're visiting a planet in space shooting fireballs (3D).
 Another 3D-scene is on, a marble surface morphs into different shapes.
 Wow! And another, this time a blurred room with some kind of mirror in
 the middle of the floor. Cool! The coder most be fond of reflections
 and light, the next 3D-sequence is a "thing" with legs reflecting a
 sharp light when it is in the right position. A great, but slow routine
 which is shown a little too long.
 The greetings are a water-effect that instead of rings in the water form
 the group names. And instead of using a watery background a fire like
 background is used, looks great.
 The last effect is maybe the greatest of all: A 3D-object rotates above
 some water. When it hit the surface of the water, you can see the small
 waves spreading. And when it dives, the color changes, so that it
 actually looks as if it's under water!
 The end scroller reminds me a little of the one in the film "Seven",
 strange design. In the background you see some screenshots from the demo.

Conclusion: A must see! An overlooked demo.

Inside information: Braindead's first demo that doesn't use AMOS as base-

+ Two nice animations
- Some ugly animations, quite boring

Comment: Infect! who is mostly known because of their fine wild demos is
 the team behind this production, and just like their wild demos it's made
 from animations rather than code. Most of the animations looks like
 drawings drawn by a child, but there are two good ones: A tunnel with a
 ball in the middle and a flight above a landscape. Both of these
 animations uses a small palette, would be nice to see them in full color.
 The demo gets quite boring, generally it isn't pretty, and most of the
 time either the ugly animations or BBS-adds are shown. A nice feature is
 that you can make some of the animations run at maximum speed by pressing
 F10, I think every demo should have a such button!
 The music is techno (of course), quite strange, but then again it fits the
 demo.

+ Nice (but SLOW) routines
- Needs a hell of a CPU to run at an acceptable speed, few routines

Comment: Contains some of the slowest routines I've ever seen! More precise
 I'm talking about a env-mapped, rotating bumpmap-like thing with a wave
 starting from the middle and (very) slowly moves towards the edges of the
 map. Only half the screen is used, on the other half of the screen is
 Arnie in his "Terminator 2" outfit and a text saying something like:
 "They must be elite! 1x1 in 8-bit planes". That might be true, but hell
 it's slow. Another effect is a 3D flat scene with a woman lying on it
 (like Arnie she's in front of the effect). Last routine is a picture that
 is "twisted" from the middle and out...
 The graphics are average, the scans below average. The music is techno...
 Either the machine used at the KG6 party was a monster (FAST!) or else
 the other demos where miserable!

Conclusion: If your eyes update just as slow as the routines in this demo
 it might look nice...

+ CV64 support
- It's SLOW! Few routines

Comment: A strange demo this one, not because of the routines, but because
 of the way it's made. When you're going to start it (from CLI/Shell) you
 are able to give some options, for example you can choose to use
 CyberVision 64. Nice! But unfortunately I haven't got such a thing,
 therefore I had to run it using AGA in HAM-mode. The result: SLOW! So I
 tried to run in grayscale mode which help a lot on the speed, but it isn't
 the same without colors. And still it's slow.
 I think this is just one big animation more or less, I wonder how they've
 put it together, and not least why!
 At first a 3D-logo is slowly zoomed away from the viewer. After some text
 the first "real" routine starts, it is a raytraced, transparent sign
 coming from the top of the screen, and the top of a column from the lower
 part of the screen. The screen changes to a text again (which it does
 after every routine), and afterwards the next raytraced 3D object is on: A
 gear wheel. The last raytraced objects are about six small different
 objects flying around in a circle. Then it's time for the Dreamscape (tm).
 It's a 3D scene taking place in the desert among a lot of pyramids. It's
 seen from different angles while where following five futuristic airplanes
 are shot down by another airplane. I can't help thinking of Kefrens'
 @{" Desert Dream " link "DesertDream"}, the Triumph crew neither!
 The music is typical demo music, not bad.

- Primitive animation (but then again it's charming)

Comment: I don't know if I should call this a demo, as it only consists of
 a presentation, a long animation (2036 frames) and an end scroller. The
 animation is made using simple lines, most of it looks like something
 drawn by a child. The real cool thing about this demo is the "morphing"
 into new scenes. Very original. Another great thing is how the last
 animation frame changes into an end-picture. The music in the demo is a
 piece of well timed techno, the end theme is a quiet, old melody.

Conclusion: Watch this one! One of the most original "demos" yet!

+ Okay design
- Non-AGA causes of course few colors, rather primitive routines

Comment: This is Abyss' last non-AGA demo (they say), and I think that a
 fair and wise decision they've made there. Most Amigans out there own an
 AGA-machine, I guess. The lack of AGA means lack of colors, and as it is
 able to run on the non-AGA machines, which are rather slow, the routines
 are mostly pretty primitive compared to today's standards. But that
 doesn't mean that they are ugly, just simple. After a "legal" message
 the show starts with synth music and a @{" rotating pixel landscape " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Drugstore_1.GIF"}. Landscape
 maybe isn't the right word, the idea is the same, but the "landscape" is
 a small picture of an eye. Suddenly a ball drops from the top of the
 screen and bounces down on the eye causing it to behave like a trampoline.
 @{" More pixels " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Drugstore_2.GIF"} are coming up, this time they fly in a long string making
 beautiful patterns. A head interrupts and introduces some vector routines:
 A cube which is somehow being displaced a little, so that it sometimes
 looks as if it is about to be torn apart. Furthermore two grids are slowly
 moving in front and behind it. In the end of the effects a mosaic is shown
 in the cube. Another face tells us how cool pixel effects are (and how
 lame vector routines are...) which causes another pixel routine: A text-
 @{" scroller " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Drugstore_3.GIF"} moving in a waving circle while pushing a picture of a face. Cute
 idea. The next effect is a very transparent box in front of a picture.
 The only way you can see the box is that it displaces the pixels a little.
 It doesn't act like glass at all, and doesn't look as nice, either. The
 next effect is some kind of color zoomer in a small box. The resolution is
 low, the display area little and the effect isn't so very nice. After that
 a lot of credits are on, and afterwards the pixel routine is back making
 beautiful circular patterns. Another dot landscape is on, much bigger than
 the first one and the speed is the same. Finally there's the endscroller
 and in the background the color zoomer routine runs fullscreen, and with
 the same speed as before! The last part tends to be too long with lots of
 text and addresses.
 The pictures that are shown between some of the routines are quite good,
 especially considering that it is non-AGA pictures. The first piece of
 music is an okay techno tune, the second a synth/techno tune, the last one
 a quiet synth tune with a to loud synth. Non of it is timed to the music,
 but fits anyway.

Conclusion: For those who haven't bought an AGAmiga yet.

- Few and slow routines

Comment: Let me start with the end. When the demo is over it says: "This
 was made in an Extreme hurry"... And it obviously is. There are two
 routines in it, a slow 3D scene taking place in some kind of dark room
 with bend columns standing in a circle, and in the middle of this circle
 are four small lightning balls, and a nice red and yellow plasma routine
 where you (unfortunately?) can see it's rallying point. Furthermore there
 are three average pictures and some fair atmospheric synth/techno music.

+ Some nice routines, okay music that is well timed, nice pictures
- Uses a strange ball-display for several routines

Comment: A quite nice little production. It starts with the demo creator's
 names that are shown using a transparent font, so that you can see a
 texture through them. Furthermore they slowly move around and the "main"-
 words are zoomed a bit, cute. The first "real" effect is a fast texture
 mapped cube with small different pictures on each side (close-ups of a
 woman's face I guess). One reason why it is so fast is probably the
 strange mini-ball-display that is used, the box simply looks as if it is
 made from lots of small balls. I don't really know if it's nice, I don't
 think so, but different, yes! All effects which are exposed to this
 display tends to be unclear, blurred with a low level of details and
 precision. And many of the effects later in the demo uses this display.
 Still I think it's better than standard blitterscreen display. Well, back
 to the box. The texture on its sides starts to rotate, zoom and twirl!
 Pretty cool! Afterwards an okay picture is shown, and a couple of seconds
 after this picture is used in a ball-display plasma routine, a nice one
 too. Time for a ride! Next up is a picture zoomer routine, you are simply
 zooming into a lot of pictures. The routine is fast, but also very
 unprecise and a bit jumpy everytime a picture is changed, the display is
 not that ball-display, now it's just pretty unclear... If you want to
 see a good zoomer (and a great demo) try TBL's @{" Captured Dreams " link "CapturedDreams"}...
 A short black/white video sequence where a guy kicks the screen (!) is on,
 the greetings are written on the shoe's sole. Original I must say!
 After a nice picture a fast phong is shown using ball-display which ruins
 it pretty much (or adds another dimension?!). After that some kind of
 blur/rotator routine is used on a picture, and finally the letters BLC
 (I wonder what that stands for :)) is shown in this strange display that
 makes the texture mapping on the letters look unsharp.
 The endscroller are for very fast readers, in the beginning it runs at a
 normal speed, but after the credits it accelerates and is over after a
 few seconds. Nobody ever read those texts anyway? A logo is on at last and
 you can exit with a click on the mouse.
 The music is a quite okay synth/techno piece timed well to the demo.

Conclusion: Worth having a look at

+ OK 3D-scenes, nice design
- Low resolution, needs a lot of CPU power

Comment: Not all of the routines are fast enough to run on a '030-40MHz,
 but they are acceptable. It starts out with a 3D-scene showing some
 @{" TV-screens " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Endolymfa1.GIF"} with different animations in them. The colors are blue, green
 and red and this goes for the rest of the demo as well. After that there's
 a very cool effect, where a moving blurred box reflects some letter
 flying in front of it (needs quite a lot of CPU power). The @{" torus-routine " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Endolymfa2.GIF"}
 (how original!) is by some reason rather slow. A @{" torus " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Endolymfa5.GIF"} that is reflected
 in another 3D-object is nice, though. In the end there's is another
 @{" 3D-object " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Endolymfa8.GIF"} (star-shaped), but this time a text is scrolled on the surface.
 The music is a mixture of heavy rock and techno. Fits the demo.

 look at.

Comment: This demo is the successor to @{" Fraction " link "Fraction"}, but unfortunately
 the quality is almost the same, maybe this one is a little worse than the
 first @{" Fraction " link "Fraction"}. And as far as I remember it has nothing to
 do with @{" Fraction " link "Fraction"} (besides the name). Well, to the demo:
 An ugly B/W sign with the demo's name is shown. Then the first routine
 starts: A lot of bright spots are flying around, looks a little like a 3D-
 starfield, except that the stars are not stars, they're more like small
 cotton-pieces. This routine is a little slow, and so is the next: A vector
 scene taking place in a hightech hallway or the like. While we're flying
 around the credits are shown. It looks like something that would be nice
 for a dusty A500 (maybe even for a clean one:-)), but not for a A1230!
 After this failure (?!) a nice picture by Typhoon is shown. But
 unfortunately Gods (who doesn't really live up to their name...) have
 chosen to have another vector-scene of some kind, this time it's a lot of
 small things flying around, and a big thing in the middle. After that
 there's a not too smooth plasma routines followed by a pretty nice twirl
 effect. After that there's a slow phong object, with a quite limited
 palette. A picture is shown which disappears in a flash. A very slow
 texturemapped box with credits on its sides is the result of the flash.
 And then a possible explanation about the previous vector scenes,
 because the next routine is a texturemapped 3D-scene talking place in a
 tower with a winding staircase, and it is very slow! We are moving up the
 stairs, and when reaching the top there's another flash, and a Gods-
 picture is shown. The demo is over. The music is a quiet piece of techno,
 quite good.

Conclusion: Not essential.

+ Very nice effects, great graphic, colorful
- Seems more like a lot of small demos than one big one, as all effects are
  split up with a black screen between them

Comment: Another great production from the (mainly) German group Artwork!
 The package includes two executable files, which are executed by a little
 script. The first one is a plain 3D landscape with rocks lying around and
 some scanned people standing (well, actually it's the same person copied a
 lot). You fly around above and sometimes it even turns 360°, so that you
 fly upside down. When you fly around the person(s) you can see them from
 different angles. But a negative thing is that you can clearly see that
 the person is just a scanned picture that is changed with a new one when
 you change the viewpoint. There are some frames missing between the
 existing frames. And it's in grayscale, unlike the rest of the demo which
 is pretty colorful. But anyway, it looks nice and moves rather smoothly.
 Suddenly the effect changes to a very fast bumpmap where the credits are
 shown. And then it changes back to the 3D-scape where some of the stones
 have started to fly? And then back to the bumpmap which shows more
 credits. And back again, now about all stones are flying and also the
 person from before. Hehehe... Seen to many Sci-Fi movies lately? :-)
 The second executable file is the main part of the demo. It starts with a
 very nice 3D planet scene where you fly around in the universe, seeing
 some light sourced planets and the suns where the light comes from. Of
 course there are lensflares... The next effect also takes place in space
 (I guess), we see a texturemapped spaceship from the outside flying right
 through a brick wall! The background is colorful though, and so they are
 in most parts of the demo. Almost all the demo's effects are separated by
 a black screen that is shown for a short very short period of time. The
 "problem" about this is not the time it takes, it is that you feel that
 the demo is a lot of small demos instead of one great production. It's
 just routine after routine after routine etc., very nice routines, but
 anyway... The next effect is that some small stars fly through two
 transparent pipes. The stars are used a lot later in the demo together
 with different kinds of phong objects. But before the first phong there's
 a 3D tunnel which is a bit slow, but nice! The "camera" rotates in all
 directions in it. Then there's some kind of a light sourced 3D sign
 with two of the mentioned stars flying around it (it doesn't seem as if
 they are the light sources, but I could be wrong). And finally: The
 phongs. There are many! All kinds of phong (texturemapped, ordinary and
 bumpmapped... Ups, did I say ALL kinds? There doesn't seem to be any
 transparent ones)! And all of them are objects that look like stones,
 beans and blobs. At one point in the demo there even is a jelly phong
 "grid". It is simply a grid that is placed all over the screen, slowly
 waving in the artificial wind. Also to mention is a slow, but in spite of
 everything beautiful 3D-scene, where a person is standing in a big room on
 a platform in front of a pool filled with water. The resolution is good,
 but you'll need the '040/40 that Artwork has recommended to make this go
 smoothly. More effects of the same kind that has already been described
 are shown before the demo ends with three light sourced signs shown one
 after another saying the demo's name (just in case that you missed it in
 the beginning...). The music is a piece of well-timed techno which is also
 atmospheric when it needs to be.

Conclusion: Very nice indeed. You MUST see this one!

Note: Because of problems with the demo's size, which had to be below 5 MB
 according to the rules at The Gathering, and because of time problems
 some of the demo's effects are restricted, and the endpart (with music by
 Virgill) is cut off. A final version is also released.

Inside information: Azure forgot to credit RockDaZone in the demo, he made
 the intro-tune together with Skyphos, and is also the one with the tired
 voice!

 effects aren't centered.
 A very nice routine is a zooming fractal that runs smooth, a voxel
 landscape is nice too, and so are the tunnel with mountains rising from
 its walls. Of course there's also a torus...
 The endpart is a doom-routine by TTS (who also made the winner intro from
 The Party 6 called Phongfree which contains a doom routine much like the
 one in this demo). It's a little slow and the sounds (there's no music in
 this part) are the same primitive noises as in the original Doom game.

Conclusion: Not bad. The doom routine separates this demo from lots of
 others. But on the other hand it takes up almost four megs of HD...

Inside information:
 - Was supposed to have a better design, but because of a crash 10 minutes
   before the deadline at TP5 TTS had to take an old version of the demo.
   He refused to make a "final"-version because that the routines would
   become to old.
 - The Doom-routine is actually made for a game (called Trapped).

+ Nice routines, design, pictures and music
- Some slow routines

Comment: It starts with a @{" big gray 2D object " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Extreme1.GIF"} with a hole in the middle
 zooms towards you. Through the hole you can see a phong face which is
 lightened by a moving lightsource. Very nice. The music is very
 atmospheric too. Then we see a slow @{" phong face " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Extreme2.GIF"} that is very close to the
 screen moving from side to side, and suddenly a line saying "Balance"
 scrolls over it. It's pretty slow, but nice on a faster machine I guess.
 The face stops moving and the screen is split into two by a bumpmap in
 the middle of the screen, reaching from left edge of the screen to the
 right. Letters slowly, but smoothly, appear on the map. Nice! The screen
 changes and the credits are shown with zooming, blurred, rotating text,
 the resolution is pretty low, but it looks fine.
 A nice picture by Grid is shown, then the screen becomes black and the
 other half of the demo starts.
 The music changes into some melodic demo music and a glinting purple
 @{" phong object " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Extreme8.GIF"} is shown. Rather tasteless, but it's pretty smooth. Then
 there's a @{" tunnel " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Extreme6.GIF"} with rings of light moving on its sides, and then there
 is a very special routine that I think hasn't been seen before: A 3D
 object combined with a moving bumpmap. Actually I think it's a 3D object
 and a tunnel which is bumpmapped. Looks terrific, but is a bit slow!
 Finally there's an ugly phong. There seems to be an error in my demo, so
 that the last two routines aren't shown - would someone please send me
 a new copy?

Conclusion: Watch this one!

+ Nice code, graphic and music
- Short

Comment: The first Faktory demo, not as successful as it's follower, but
 still good. Actually the only serious thing against it is its duration,
 it lasts for only a couple of minutes. The speed is fast and most of the
 routines too. The quite quiet and rather atmospheric techno music is a
 very good choice for the demo. Also considering the colorful, funky
 pictures it just seems to fit somehow.
 It begins with some logos, and when the title is shown shortly after small
 transparent bubbles start to swim up to the top from the bottom of the
 screen. Nice! Some of the later effects, including the next one, only use
 a small display area, the rest of the screen is used for pictures
 presenting mostly woman (of course...). It's some kind of plasma combined
 with a bumpmap effect, looks like those biology films where bacteria have
 been recorded through a microscope... Next on is a twirling tunnel, this
 one isn't shown with a picture next to it, but shortly after it's shown
 in four small windows instead of just one big one. The next routine is a
 variation of the "bakteria" routine, and it is followed by a wrapped ball
 routine: A ball shape is present in the middle of the screen and a texture
 is wrapped around this ball, and on the same time connected to the
 screen's edges. It all moves around at great speed. Next one is shown with
 a picture next to it, it's a env-mapped 3D object presenting a space craft
 designed a bit like the one's that are used for landing on the Moon, just
 with a jet engine mounted in each of its feet, and from these you see a
 bright light. Nice and fast because of the small display area used. The
 big final is a texture mapped television with a plasma routine in the
 background. While the TV is flying around an eye appears on the screen,
 and it even blinks to you! It's pretty fast too. The show ends with a
 picture, a scan.

Conclusion: Too bad it's so short, but it's recommended anyway!

+ Some nice routines
- Both graphic and music are below average, lacks design

Comment: One thing I've noticed about this demo: The code is good, but both
 the graphic and music cannot keep up with the code. Nor can the design.
 And that's too bad, because besides from that it's a quite nice demo.
 At first a picture with the group name is shown, looks as if it could need
 some hours of work. The screen changes to a little plasma effect centred
 in the middle of the screen with the word "presents" coming out of it,
 nice. The title is also shown with a picture, the quality the same as
 before. Then the effects start for real, beginning with a nice, but slow
 3D scene representing a chessboard, of course with a couple of chess
 pieces on it. The area used for display goes from the top to the bottom of
 the screen, but is cut off in the sides, so it got a shape mostly like a
 box of matches. The resolution is good, which unfortunately results in a
 not very smooth ride over the board, but I guess it looks great on faster
 processors (if it runs on such). The next effect is cool on "ordinary"
 Amigas (that is '030): A tunnel, which is actually two tunnels, one looks
 like an ordinary tunnel seen in lots of other demos, while the other one
 is inside this tunnel and is more like a grid in different patterns than
 a tunnel. And it looks great! Furthermore small explosions are getting
 closer to you! The next routine, a torus, is quite unoriginal if it wasn't
 because it being partly transparent. The resolution is good, but it
 doesn't move smoothly. A picture is shown and the demo music is cut of
 abruptly, and shortly after it's taken over by a new piece. The next
 routine is brilliant. It's another 3D scene, but unlike the first one this
 is fast, and the resolution is still good. The display area is again in
 matchbox format. We are in a room with some mirrors pointing towards a
 star-like object which is in the middle of it all, and it is of course
 mirrored in the mirrors (that's what mirrors are for...)! Nice textures,
 pretty smooth movement, great routine! The next routine is great too:
 A lot of grids in a layers, so that the ones away from you is smaller than
 the ones close to you, are rotated with a little delay from top to bottom
 so that the one away from you is rotated later than the ones closest to
 you. Looks great! And more 3D, this time a not too ordinary texturemapped,
 lightsourced box, firstly there are some sticks with spheres in the ends
 put right through it, secondly from one or two of the box's sides a bump
 grows, then disappears and then grows again. Strange, but nice. Then
 there's even more 3D objects, but that's not the most interesting part
 about this routine, it's the background which is lightsourced, so that it
 constantly changes. Again the music is suddenly cut off, and the end scene
 is on: A 3D TV screen moving from side to side showing the credits, very
 nice! Then everything is cut off and the demo is over.

Conclusion: Despite the music, graphic and design it's worth watching.

Note: Arsenic will maybe (hopefully) release an improved version.

+ Different
- Simple crazy demo that are not as funny as they want it to be

Comment: A little crazy demo that aren't too funny, however, it's different
 from the crowd. It starts with two round eyes which look around while
 there are some atmospheric sounds playing (I'd say that they've watched
 Desert Dream by Kefrens!). After that there are some information which is
 made so that it looks like a bar code. A vector cube with numbers on its
 sides counts down to the title that is written with "@"'s. Afterwards an
 extremely slow vector sign "moves" around on the screen (is updated two
 times pr. second or so!), strange kind of humour. After a "stars on ball"-
 routine, there's a pixel box spinning around (I guess it's not pixels,
 though). And then for a very uninteresting routine: A PeeCee-simulator.
 Delon mention these PeeCees a lot of times during the demo. The routine
 lasts too long I think, how much fun is it looking at a PeeCee Dos and
 DBase (even if it's able to "communicate"?). After this a vector man is
 hanged, followed by a picture of Bill Gates. A low-res rotator with a
 scrolltext in front of it ends the show.

Conclusion: Supposed to be funny, but I think it fails.

Inside Information: Should have been at The Party 1 (they say), but their
 car broke down, so they never made it to Aars (the party place).

+ Nothing
- Everything

Comment: First Contact it is called, probably because that this is their
 first demo (as they call it), but it also looks as if it's their first
 contact with a computer. And if they can't do much better than what they
 have shown here I hope that it is there last! The "demo" is split into two
 files, and in the copy I got nobody had written a script (which I
 understand perfectly...), one file contains an "intro" which is some
 scanned absurd grayscale pictures and hardcore with samples from Monty
 Python's "The Search For the Holy Grail" (Eki Eki Eki...!). Some texts
 are written on the pictures welcoming you.
 The second file consists of a grayscale video recording of two people
 (my over-qualified guess is that it is Tiger and Ramboy) doing silly
 things. The frame rate is about 4-5 pictures per second, and the quality
 is lousy. You see three seconds or so of the video, then the same sequence
 is looped a couple of times, a new sequence is looped and so on. Boring!
 The music is, as in the first part, hardcore. And it sounds rather
 terrible (as if the left and right speaker plays two different hardcore
 modules!). I wonder if they know the difference between a video camera and
 a computer. However, it looks as if they have had a great time.

Conclusion: Waste of time, energy and space. This is crap!

- Misc. things that could be improved

Comment: One of LED's early productions I guess, not bad, but there's
 nothing impressive about it either. The code, graphic and music are all
 on a pretty good level, while the design is a failure in some ways, mainly
 because of the choice of colors.
 While some gloomy tunes are heard the intro-pictures are shown combined
 with some small fast "transition"-effects in between. The first real
 routine is a rotating ball consisting of lines only. Simple, but nice and
 fast. Next one is a texture mapped and lightsourced square torus with
 the groups name on it, and also the next effect is a torus, this time a
 big texture mapped phong thing that is both pretty smooth and unoriginal.
 Coming up next is a jelly column that seems to spin around in both
 directions, nice. The pixel effect afterwards is nice too, it's a lot of
 pixels that together forms some kind of dot-"plates". And after that a
 texture plasma zoomer/rotator appears. It's a fast routine, but the
 resolution isn't good enough to make it look nice, still it is an okay
 routine. The last effect is the credits that are shown with white letters
 on a black screen, then blurred away. Finally their's an endscroller.
 The music is techno, a good tune it is, and timed to the demo most of the
 time.

Rating: ***---

+ Generally nice routines and pictures, good atmosphere
- The effects are pretty much the same throughout the demo

Comment: As usual with the Anadune demos their logo appears in the
 beginning. And likewise as in other of their demos it has a special
 atmosphere, a special feel that cannot really be described, you actually
 have to watch the demos to understand it. This time they've made a
 Sci-Fi demo, that are the pictures in the demo and the gloomy synth music
 are pretty Sci-Fi-like, while the code is... well, pretty good, but not
 so very futuric.
 After the Anadune logo disappears a pilot's (I guess) face with a helmet
 starts to say something (introducing the demo and party place), it's a
 bit difficult to understand as the sample quality isn't exactly the best
 imaginable, still it helps creating a good atmosphere. Logos and title are
 shown afterwards using some pretty good pictures. The first coded effect
 is a cone with moving texture map and moving lightsource, smooth, fast and
 nice (but I don't really see the connection to Sci-Fi as stated earlier).
 More texture mapping is up next as three small balls with different
 texture maps dances across the screen and back again. The scene changes to
 a big lightsourced vector ball with polygons covering its surface.
 Afterwards a spiral effect appears, looks like a lot of dots that together
 forms two opposite spirals, nice pixel-effect, but might be a little too
 simple to be entertaining in the long run. A nice Sci-Fi picture (of
 course with a woman present) by Kazik is then shown while waiting for the
 credits part to start. It does after some time and is by the way nice, but
 is build upon the same routines as the cone in the beginning of the demo.
 In the left side of the screen is a texture mapped column with moving
 lightsource, in the right side the credits are shown on small "hi-tech"
 signs. Nice and atmospheric. A line routine appears afterwards, a lot of
 lines are moving around one after another and is lighty blurred so that it
 makes a small tail after it. The next effect is rather nice, another
 texture mapped ball, but this time with three lightsources, red, green and
 blue flying around it causing the ball to constantly change it colors.
 Before the endscroller a picture is shown, and the demo ends with a click
 on the left mouse button.

Conclusion: Recommended for Anadune fans!

+ Smooth routines, good music
- Some simple parts

Comment: One of the old demos that was so very popular back then, a 2nd
 place at The Party was/is really something, especially when you compete
 with 28 other productions from among others Sanity, Spaceballs, etc.
 Today the demo isn't the best, the age shows, but still it's actually
 worth watching. The routines run smoothly, Skull hasn't tried to go
 beyond the computer's performance, but maybe if you run it on a standard
 machine it isn't that fast?
 The first thing that happens when you start the demo is that a big
 Fairlight logo is shown while a voice informs us about a movie is about to
 start. And it does, the screen changes to a little screen that is placed
 in the middle of the screen (the monitor...), and on this a nice, little
 gray-scale voxel routine is shown. In front of it the credits are shown
 with nice handwritten letters. Afterwards the "real" movie start, it's a
 Doom-routine, one of the first on Amiga I guess, and also rather
 primitive, but with some nice textures on the paper thin walls. The floor
 and ceiling are just black, which together with the small display area and
 the low resolution makes it fast. The show now changes to fullscreen and a
 pretty nice fire effect is on as the next living picture. The music that
 untill now has been a synth piece suddenly changes to demo/techno music,
 and the effect changes to a texture rotator/stretch routine that is fast,
 but the texture could have been better. Fractals are always nice (almost),
 the backwards zooming fractal afterwards a is no exception. Still it
 really costs to make such smooth routines, and in this case the display is
 muddy to look at, still worth watching though. A growing and rotating dot
 mountain is on next, followed by a picture that looks a bit as if it has
 been drawn with a pencil. A little "3D-scene" appears after the picture,
 consisting of a lot of simple objects, not too nice seen with the eyes of
 today. The next routine is about as simple (if not more simple), zooming
 lines. They are spread in nice patterns all over the screen, moving
 towards you in a great hurry. A picture is exposed to a stretch routine
 next, stretching it only on one axis, though. The plasma routine
 afterwards is nice except for the muddy display, the same used during the
 fractal routine. Also the picture that is twirled and plasmated afterwards
 is also using that display, but also this routine is nice and for all
 fast. Reaching the end a strange shade zoomer is on, looks a bit like a
 tunnel, but really has to be seen to understand what's going on. A quite
 untraditional endscroller is on next. First of all the letters keep
 zooming towards you or away from you, making it quite unreadable. And
 secondly, in the background there's a blitterscreen rotating color zoomer.
 Ugly colors, but it's fast and smooth. The music in this part is good, a
 melodic synth piece.

Conclusion: Worth having a look at

+ Fast routines
- Blitterscreen, small bugs in 3D-objects, not user friendly concerning
  mixing rate settings. Sudden ending.

Comment: Only blitterscreen is used for displaying the routines, which
 makes them go faster, but doesn't look too good. A voxel landscape with
 the sun in the background is one of the routines. When you see the sun
 you'll see lens flares, nice effect. Some phong stones and rings are some
 of the other effects in the demo, but while the rings are fine, the stones
 are buggy: You can sometimes see some holes and white spots on the edges.
 On the other hand it's pretty fast. A texture tunnel with moving
 lightsource, a plasma twister ("waves" from the center of the screen) and
 the last effect: A morphing lightsourced 3D-landscape (with about the same
 bugs as the phong). And suddenly the demo just ends! Is there an error in
 my copy? The music is a multichannel quite quiet synth piece
 (Screamtracker mod), which is okay, and worth remembering when watching
 the demo is that some CPU time is used when mixing the music.

Conclusion: Good intentions, too many small bugs

Inside information: It is said that the reason why this demos placing
 wasn't higher, was that Stellar didn't include the Stellar logo, and the
 party organizers did not announce it as a Stellar production.
 The logo wasn't included because it the demo was put together in one day,
 the day before that Stellar had to leave from Finland to Denmark (the
 party place). Nose tried to put the logo in the end of the demo 10 minutes
 before he left his house to catch the bus, but it crashed and was
 therefore not included. Why they didn't do it at The Party is an
 unanswered question. (Source: ROM 6)

+ Nice routines
- They could work with the transitions between the routines

Comment: This is the re-mixed version of @{" Galerie " link "Galerie"}, as the title suggests.
 Therefore the routines are pretty much the same, but I think they have
 been optimized, or else the routines are just faster because that the
 display area used for some of the effects are a bit small. Generally they
 are nice and smooth, so the small display area is forgiven.
 The first routine is a very fast voxel landscape, completely with
 background with the sky and a sun that causes lens flares. The resolution
 is good too. The next routine is a "spotlight-on-title"-effect, like
 bumpmap without bumps. Nice. Afterwards we're flying through a 3D-tunnel
 together with three or four small bright balls that lights up the place!
 A rather good picture by Frankie is shown for while, then the texturemap
 phong routines start, and it's a fast routine too! At first a big blob
 is on, after a plasma tunnel three phong rings that moves independently
 are shown, and finally a third object is following a picture that looks
 a little as if it has been painted, not drawn. The two last routines are
 a nice colored bumpmap and a lightly blurred tunnel, both are fast.
 The music is an atmospheric piece of funk with some synths added.

Conclusion: A worthy follower, and recommended!

- Lacks design concerning the changes from one effect to another

Comment: Wow, the first demo supporting the Graffiti videocard - too bad I
 haven't got that... So I'll just stick to the normal version, or rather:
 The Aminet version, which is different from the original party release
 because it has been bugfixed (almost superfluous to say), some textures
 has been changed, and as mention before Graffiti support. But I must say
 that it works pretty well without this videocard, that is if you use the
 recommended equipment. The show start with a nice voxel desert with the
 credits fading in and out in front of it, it's a little slow for my
 machine, but still nice. The music (by Virgill) in this sequence ensures
 the right mood and atmosphere, just like it is the case for the music in
 the demo's second part, which is a mixture of rock and techno (by SMT).
 It starts with a very fast zoom routine, where you zoom into a picture.
 The resolution is a bit low, but acceptable. A lot of small, bend phong
 torusses are up next, flying across the screen in a locked pattern (they
 don't leave their place in the shoal). The speed is good, but
 unfortunately the objects appear not long from the screen, which I think
 they should. The @{" title picture " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/GateTitle.GIF"} is shown and after that a blank head with
 moving lightsources around it (that you can't see), which makes it look
 like that the surface is moving. Nice! The torusses is back, actually just
 one of them, but which one! Despite the unoriginalty of the chosen object
 this texturemapped phong torus is nice. The resolution is good and the
 movement is quite smooth! A torus is also to be found in the next routine,
 you can't see it though, because it is held "prisoner" in a box and is
 trying to get out! You can see the torus shaped bump it makes in the side
 of the box! More phong and another torus is to be seen in the next effect
 (I'd wish that Artwork had used a little more time creating some more
 interesting objects, even though the torusses are not completely torus-
 shaped they are pretty much the same, and seen in lots of other demos).
 The special thing about this torus is that the surface changes, in state
 one it has a smooth texture mapped surface, in state two it is covered
 with triangles. Nice! Afterwards a picture by Fiver is shown, pretty good
 and original. The next effect is not original, but quite nice anyway, it's
 a colored bumpmap slowly moving around. Right after the same bumpmap is
 shown rotating, unfortunately the rotation is not smooth, but not useless
 either. The next routine is one of those rather unexplainable square
 effects, where you see some layers of square plates with square holes in
 the middle. It rotates so that the layer in top moves first, the next
 layer moves a little later and so on. It gives some kind of spiral effect
 that looks great! Furthermore they are blurred a little. After that we
 return to the bumpmap and 3D objects at the same time (guess what!):
 A bumpmapped box. The texture is the same strange also used in the plain
 bumpmap routine, but besides that it's good, that goes for the speed too.
 And while we're at it let's see another torus. From the inside this time.
 Actually it's more like a moving texture routine, the texture is the only
 thing that moves, but it looks okay. The next routine is a gouraud shaded
 (I guess) mosque, not much to say about it: A bit slow and doesn't fit
 into the show in my opinion. So let's get back to the torusses (sigh!):
 A morphing one. A plain texture mapped torus morphed into one with a lot
 of bends on it, strange, but nice. Suddenly the music is cut off, which
 obviously indicates that the demo is about to end. A such cut should
 really not happen in a demo in this quality (or in any demo for that
 matter). The endscroller starts, it's a bumpmapped one, and another piece
 of music is started, this time an pretty atmospheric synth-piece (by
 Virgill).

Conclusion: It's good, but I wonder a little why it was rated so high in
 the disk mag's charts. It's not exceptional.

Note: Some bugs are fixed and some textures are changed in the Aminet
 version.

Inside information: Was supposed to be released at The Party 5, but they
 didn't finished it in time and therefore the project was cancelled for a
 while.
 The whole demo was about to be dropped because that some routines had been
 used in the intro Creep, and because that Azure, who is the main-coder,
 did not really believe in the project after all the problems they've had
 with it.
 Artwork were short on time, so Fiver, Tron and Azure gathered at Fiver's
 place to finish the demo. After two days of non-stop work much work were
 still to be done, but they had to leave for the party, where they also
 worked without breaks. The demo was handed over just in time.

+ Lots of nice routines
- The resolution is sometimes low

Comment: Dreamy tunes sound. A "The Black Lotus"-sign suddenly appears with
 a T2-effect (the upper half scrolls from the upper part of the screen, the
 opposite with the lower half). The screen changes to the inside of a space
 station, where a @{" space craft " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Glow5.GIF"} is about to take off. When the ship takes off
 there's a matching sound.  The resolution is rather low (2x2), but it
 looks fine. The demo creator's names are shown with the T2-effect,
 changing from the space craft to the credits a couple of times. The music
 (new age like at this point) does not work well with the T2-effect, but is
 OK to the space craft scenes, which is about to end, as the craft has now
 left the space station and flies away. The next things that happen is that
 the music changes to a mixture of slow techno/jungle and hiphop, and that
 a planet moves closer to the viewer while two light sources (might be two
 space crafts) fly towards it. When the planet is very close, the scene
 changes to some kind of cave with a flat ceiling and a flat floor (giving
 you the illusion that the crafts has now entered a cave hidden in the
 planet). Between the floor and ceiling there are some ugly flashes. Too
 bad that TBL has done nothing about these to make them look better.
 After this journey a pretty good picture by Louie is shown. The next
 routine consists of some @{" mountains " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Glow7.GIF"} and some suns flying above in a great
 hurry. Everytime a sun passes over the mountains you can see the surfaces
 change to the light, looks great! Then there's a ordinary (more or less)
 phong object, actually it isn't completely ordinary, because from three
 holes in it shines the three primary colors. The next phong is animated
 and pictures a plant that is spitting lightballs out of its "flower".
 Nice! Afterwards there's a texturemapped plasma bumpmap with a moving
 lightsource flying between the viewer and the bumpmap! Great! Then we're
 moving @{" inside a torus " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Glow4.GIF"} which suddenly stops, and some texturemapped
 phong objects takes over (the torus is used as background), but it isn't
 ordinary phongs (again!), because they melt together now and then. Looks
 great! Shortly after it starts to be blurred and after a while everything
 is gone. Small flying spots with different colors takes over, and since
 the blur routine is still on they have some long tales. The choice of
 colors could have been better, though. More phong: A transparent,
 animated, oblong object with some kind of wave moving from one end to the
 other. Very nice! And now we get to know the demos name (better late than
 never!) which is written on a nice picture by Rodney. The next three
 routines are all transparent, which is rather impressive: There's the
 double tunnel, the tunnel combined with a voxel landscape and the voxel
 landscape combined with a plasma routine! Great! The last routine is a
  @{" 3D-tunnel " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Glow2.GIF"} with random stripes on its sides, moving at a steady speed. It
 even looks as if it is also bumpmapped!

Conclusion: Watch it!

Inside information:
 - The name Glow comes from the many glowing flashes and flares used in the
   demo. TBL wanted to show that they could handle such things as well.
 - The demo was coded in some weeks! The last bump mapped tunnel with two
   lightsources was coded in 35 minutes by Equalizer, just before he went
   to England (that is, to Team 17).
   Sounds unbelieveable...

+ Nice routines
- Could need some variation

Comment: Another great TBL production! This time one particular routine is
 used a lot: Plasma. From start to end there's @{" plasma " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/GOA1.GIF"} and more plasma, it
 looks great (actually it's some of the nicest plasma I've ever seen), but
 a little more variation would be nice. When you start the demo the TBL
 letters slowly appear piece by piece, while the techno music still hasn't
 really begun - just warming up. Then the show starts with a nice plasma
 (of course) and for the next couple seconds the screen changes between
 different colored plasmas and flicker screens (as when a TV hasn't got
 any in-signal) with credits, and of course the sound is noisy when the
 flicker screen is on - must be a bad connection :-). Reminds me of the
 good old Budbrain Megademo. After that there's a transparent one color
 3D TBL logo rotating around the Z-axis, simple but nice. More plasma, this
 time something that looks like wall wrapping. After that there's a nice
 square @{" 3D-tunnel " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/GOA2.GIF"} where we fly a couple of rounds, forward and backwards.
 And now for something completely different: A partly @{" transparent phong " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/GOA3.GIF"}
 with faces on it. Partly? Yes, you are able to see right through it,
 except for that you can't see the phong itself, only the background. A
 cool picture by Louie appears almost timed to the music and is taken over
 by something that looks like a bumpmap effect, I don't think it is,
 though, however it looks nice. Another phong object is on, this time a big
 R-shaped thing, no env-map this time. And back to the @{" plasma " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/GOA6.GIF"}, this one is
 a little unexplainable as it looks like some kind of 3D because of dark
 colors somewhere and bright colors the other places. Have a look, it
 looks great! Another great picture is shown this time one by Rodney, and
 it's taken over by blurred plasma, which again is taken over by a third
 picture (by both Louie and Rodney). Getting nearer to the end there's a
 wall wrapped bumpmap changing its position from being an ordinary bumpmap
 to bending towards the viewer. And the last routine is two phong
 env-mapped starfishes embracing each other. Cute? Nice!
 Unlike the other TBL productions I've seen this one hasn't got the nice
 changes into new effects. It's either flashes, fades or cuts, I believe
 that has something to do with a deadline.

Conclusion: Should be on your HD for sure!

+ Some nice routines, nice design
- Needs CPU power, tends to invalidate FFS (lock your drive!)

Comment: I've heard things about this demo, positive things, I've seen its
 name on the Charts, and now I've seen the demo. And honestly I am rather
 disapointed. There are no great or revolutionary routines in it, no
 amasing graphic, nor fabulous music. It's mostly pretty average, not bad.
 However, the design is pretty good. But the show must go on:
 The group name appears in a reversed blur effect, the title picture is
 shown afterwards. Then the credits part is on with a slow 3D-mountain
 slowly spinning around in the background, guess you'll need something like
 a '060 to make that one run smoothly (if the demo runs on such thing)!
 Next up is a strange color zoomer that mostly looks like a tunnel, then a
 nice env-mapped phong routine is on, the object is really original :----):
 A duck running in 1x1, relatively smooth too on a fast '030. The duck
 disappears, the screen splits and the greetings part is on. It's simply
 some group names that are zoomed towards you using blitterscreen which is
 rather ugly. Blitterscreen is also to be found in some of the next phong
 routines: A chess piece with a long fire tail, and a "scene" with lot of
 small "blobs". Both more or less ruined by the blitterscreen. The plasma
 routines that are shown in between are pretty good, though. Especially one
 that creates some kind of whirlpools next to the picture that is used.
 The last routine is another phong routine, a texture mapped bust
 presenting Beethoven. It consists of 4932 faces (they say) causing it to
 be very, very slow! I wonder if they'll make a version for PowerPC too,
 there's really nothing to watch when it's so slow!
 The strange endscroller is on as the last thing, of course.

Conclusion: Some good, some bad. For people with fast processors

Inside information: A "Gom Jabbar" is a lethal needle in the great Sci-Fi
 story Dune written by Frank Herbert. Read the book and its followers,
 watch the movie by David Lynch (and get disapointed...), read the comic
 over the movie! Seems as if only the real thing, the book that is, are
 worth spending time on! And I can't really relate the needle Gom Jabbar
 to the demo, I see no similarities. The demo isn't deadly at all!

- The routines are just average, strange (or no) design

Comment: Artwork's first demo. Everything except for the code are of a
 quite good quality, the pictures and logos are nice, and the atmospheric
 synth music is good too and well timed.
 It all starts with a logo with the credits shown in front of it, which is
 followed by a very low-res, low colored 3D scene, which is actually an
 animation. The colours a brown, army green and grey. We fly around in a
 future city with houses on tall columns and fly around a future train and
 is blinded by its front lights. The most positive thing that I can say
 about it is that it is smooth. The screen fades to black and a cube with
 a picture of a unicorn/pegasus wrapped around it appears. It's smooth,
 green, but a little little. The same cube is on when to small plasma
 fields are shown behind it, the same picture as on the cube is used as
 plasma texture. Next up is a colored voxel landscape, which is rather
 "blocky", you can clearly see the blocks it's made from, and it only moves
 forwards, backwards, in an angle of 45° or to the sides. The display area
 could be bigger. A nice picture is shown. After that a two-colored phong
 torus is on, nothing fancy about. The resolution is good, but it is a bit
 slow. It is followed by a strange box with holes in it, and shortly after
 the box with the unicorn/pegasus is back with its twin, they are moving
 around through each other, and a bug can sometimes be spotted. Crash/Polka
 Brother has coded the next routine, a fire torus (which is rather square).
 Greetings are shown around in it. And finally we've reached the last
 routine, a fast tunnel where we not only look straight forward, but also
 has a chance to have a closer look at the (dark and not too nice) texture.
 This routine is somehow based on the speed to make it work, but
 unfortunately it doesn't, I guess it is (again) because of a too small
 display area. In the end a very nice Artwork logo is shown.

Conclusion: Not a must see.

- Most of the demo uses a quite small display area, the resolution is

Comment: One demo back from the A500 days, a pretty nice one too. The
 thing that makes this demo nice isn't the effects (of course(?)), but the
 design. There's only few boring fades between some effects, but it is
 mostly a box or square that changes into a new routine. The routines are
 a zooming chessboard effect, where a lot of black and white squares
 zoom towards you, then away from you in three or four layers, the layers
 away from you are the darkest. The display is small, though, and this go
 for most of the other effects too, on the other hand there are no slow
 effects. Another effect is the plasma, the rotating colorful Lemon. sign,
 shade bobs that are flushed away the second they are drawn (looks a little
 like dust from a car on a gravel road), and two circles with spots on them
 flying around. You can see through them as long as they are not in front
 of each other. The graphic is pretty nice (but Facet has improved since
 then or maybe it is just because of the AGA his pictures are better now),
 the music is an ordinary piece of funk.

Conclusion: You can live without it

 with a light source that changes its size, but unfortunately this could
 have been made better. The idea is good, though. And just to mention it
 there's also a lowres, fast, simple, texturemapped tunnel. The music is a

 music gets a bit more techno like when the next effect is on, a twirling
 tunnel, which is split up into lots of small tunnels, pretty nice. And
 of course (?) there's phong. About five oblong objects moves around, not
 too smooth but acceptable. Another tunnel is shown, actually there are two
 transparent tunnels running each way. And twirls. And the "camera' looks
 on the sides of the tunnel. Then there's the plasma, it's blue and it's
 beautiful. More phong, something that look like stones in different
 colors. Obviously they need a pretty fast computer to run smoothly.
 Finally there's a bumpmap with letters morphing out of it. The lightsource
 doesn't move which I think it should, it would be easier to read the text
 on the area that is not lit...

Conclusion: The crew behind it could have used more time planning it, it
 has its bright moments, but still nothing but an average production.

Comment: Well, even though it's not the best demo in the world it did not
 deserve the 15th place at The Party 6 in Aars, some must have been worse
 than this! It's not that bad at all, but lacks some variation. The first
 effect for example is almost brilliant! A 3D star-like object with moving
 textures on it are turned around while a ring of small texturemapped boxes
 flies around it. It looks as if each box have a different texture on each
 side. And it almost runs smooth on my 1230/40MHz-33FPU! More 3D objects
 are shown including a transparent box. And some very slow objects are
 also shown, probably raytraced or something, but they aren't that fancy.
 The only routine that isn't a 3D object is a slow tunnel (which actually
 is a 3D object of some kind) with small textures on the sides.
 The music is a synth/techno/demo-style piece. Pretty good. The only
 graphic, except for the nice textures, is the intro picture, which looks
 as if someone took away most of the colors.

Conclusion: Needs variation, but didn't deserve the last place at TP6.

 it all looks okay (considering the type of demo). "I'm dreaming of a white

 zoomed and rotated towards you. After a Swedish text screen two big cubes
 with X-mas Elks on their sides are filling the entire screen. Both fast
 and... rotating. Next effect is the rings effect where two sets of rings
 are moved above each other, which results in a psychedelic effect.

- Snuff film (disgusting!), some slow routines

Comment: A different demo, some would say disgusting, and I agree. It all
 begins with a little black/white snuff film, where you see someone get
 shot. Delicious! After that there are some real routines: Bumpmap, a 3D
 object which dives (looks great but is quite slow), a 3D mask with waves
 in the background (slow), a 3D mask with moving lightsource and a light
 routine, where the viewer is blinded by the light (nice!). There also is
 an Env-mapped skull (slow). Between some of the parts you'll see some
 pictures, which Hannibal Lecter would probably enjoy. The last part is
 about as disgusting as the beginning: Again some snuffs are shown, but
 this time only in short flashes. The sound of a beating heart is taken
 over by the sound of one of the noisy machines at the hospital, which
 tell if the patients are still alive or not. Not worth mentioning is the
 boring greetings (some pictures). The music fits the demo, it's a piece of
 rock with some screams in it.

Comment: This long demo includes lots of different, nice, but slow effects.
 Except for the intro picture you'll see some nice pictures (a brilliant
 one by Peachy!) between some of the routines. First routine is a moving
 fractal-like thing, which in the next routine is put on all sides of a
 rotating box! Pretty nice, but pretty slow. Later there are some slow
 phongs, slow plasma and a pretty slow and simple 3D-scene, where a worm-
 like thing "walks" between some columns. And then there's a pretty fast
 routine (!): A transparent phong thing flying in front of a flame/blur
 effect. Then it's time for a dolphin jumping out of the water in a voxel
 landscape, which later starts to move (another slow routine...).
 The good music which is some synth/demo/techno/newage fits the demo.

+ Very fast routines
- Strange blitterscreen display

Comment: This production contains one of the fastest phong routine I've
 ever seen! But still it's far from the best one: 1) The display throughout
 the whole demo is some kind of blitterscreen, and 2) It's shown in "wide-
 screen" so that only about half of the screen is used for display. All in
 all I'm not really impressed compared to other phong routines, but still,
 what a speed! The most impressive part of the demo (I guess), is build on
 this fast routine. A phong object flies above a bumpmap, and it's smooth!
 The light source is fake, though, the object isn't affected by the light
 hitting the bumpmap and the other way around, but anyway it's nice. Other
 routines in the demo are different kinds of plasma, including some nice
 bump mapped ones, a couple of tunnels and more phong, blurred objects.
 The music is pretty atmospheric, it's house added some hiphop-drums, and
 later techno/house. Fits the demos somehow dark atmosphere well.

Conclusion: Definitely worth having a look at!

+ Very nice Tunnel/transparent box routine
- Low resolution, no design (which they admit in the lousy end scroller)

Comment: Not much to see in this demo that haven't been seen better before,
 and furthermore there's no design, the effects are just shown one after
 another without any fancy changes. There are a lot of classic routines:
 Gouraud shaded objects (one standard, one with blur and two flying through
 each other). The resolution is low, but on the other hand they run pretty
 smooth. More 3D: A transparent thing moves around in front of a picture,
 again it's pretty fast, but the resolution is low. Then there's some
 other env-mapped objects with the same effects as on the gourauds (blur,
 etc.), doesn't look too pretty, again mostly because of the resolution.
 Then we have a picture being twisted and wrenched (this is one of the
 nice routines), a primitive "doom"-routine (you know, like walking around
 in a basement) with no floor and ceiling, and in low-res... Ugly.
 Now the reason to view this demo: A tunnel with a transparent 3D object
 in front of it. For once the resolution is acceptable (maybe I didn't
 really notice it because of the great effect) and the speed is good too.
 The music is an average piece of funk which isn't timed to the demo, and
 doesn't fit well either.

Conclusion: Find another demo to watch unless you want to see the few good
 routines in this demo.

- Few routines, blitterscreen

Comment: There may be an error in my copy, there probably is, 'cause the
 demo is short and the last effect, which is a light blurred tunnel, never
 stops. Blitterscreen is used for showing some of the routines, which
 doesn't look too nice, especially not on a (buggy) fire-effect.

+ Some pretty nice routines
- Short demo, slow env-map routine

Comment: Begin with some okay gouraud shaded brown object. Then a fast
 texture tunnel, a (very) slow env-map routine. It seems as if the object
 used is to complicated, too many faces? If they've chosen some simple
 objects it would hide that the routine isn't the fastest ever seen.
 In between some of the effects are some pictures, which are average
 quality like the last routine, the bumpmap with moving lightsource.
 The music is one of those house things with a very fast drum rhythm, if
 you like that it's probably okay...

+ Some nice routines, fast
- Some primitive routines

Comment: One of the good old classic demos, from the good old classic demo
 group Anarchy, one of the leading groups back then. But much time has
 passed since then, and naturally you can see that the demo isn't exactly
 new. Still it has some routines that are worth watching, for example
 the dot transform routine (1296 dots they say), a sinus-scroller with
 small balls jumping on it and some kind of cycling colorshade routine that
 covers a big part of the screen with flashing colors. Also a colorful
 bending 3D-vector bar routine is worth mentioning, crazy! The more
 ordinary is things as vector boxes with different colors or raster
 shading, glenz vectors and a small twirling "Matilde Kakao" logo.
 The music is pretty good and funky. Also the graphic is good compared to
 the numbers of colors...

Conclusion: Especially for old Sceners

Note: Matilde Kakao is a Danish drinking chocolate brand! Matilde is a

+ Some pretty effects, a catchy tune
- Slow routines

Comment: A one week production it says in the readme-file, and you can see
 that on the demo. None of the routines are anything special, nor is some
 of the pictures. The music in the mainpart of the demo is quite good,
 though, it's a quite melodic demo style tune, unfortunately the technical
 quality of this piece isn't too good, but acceptable. When you start the
 demo an eye is shown in black/white, nicely drawn. Shortly after the
 credits/title sequence has begun, not too nice as the background is just
 4-colored brown-shaded texts. The first routine is a slow texture mapped,
 checked phong torus (1x1), very unoriginal and too slow on '030. Next one
 isn't coded but traced, it's a 3D-animation where the "camera" is driving
 around on the edge of what I believe is a sundial. The colors are still
 brown and still only few are used, but anyway it's pretty nice. The
 gouraud shaded blob that is on afterwards is on the other hand pretty
 ugly, just big, slow and gray. The eye from the beginning is then used in
 a texture plasma routine, but unlike most other routines of this kind a
 lightsource is moved around above it, so that it gets hit by a spotlight,
 normally only seen in bumpmap routines. You'll need a '030/50MHz to run
 this effect at a good speed. The last effect is another torus (sigh!),
 still phong, but without any texture mapping and only in 2x2 resolution,
 however its jelly and a bit faster than the first torus, still not fast
 enough to be nice. A not too nice (or different) picture is on at last,
 then both music and picture fade and the demo ends.

Conclusion: Better demo has been made, better demos will be made, this one
 is not worth watching.

+ Pretty good routines, nice graphic
- Short, low resolution, bad choice of colors

Comment: A short production which contains about two routines: A torus-like
 phong object and a tunnel, both in a quite low resolution, but on the
 other hand their speed is okay. The music, which is an atmospheric demo
 style tune, starts the demo, and after a while (too long) the routines
 starts. They're on for short period of time and then it's over. The
 colors could have been better, sometimes it's almost too dark to see
 what's on the screen, or else the colors look too similar.

+ Generally good work
- Some picture and music rips

Comment: It begins with a picture of a brick wall. In front of this a very
 well-drawn graffiti text is faded, making it look like a real wall in a
 gloomy alley... The screen fades and the first routine is on, it is some
 kind of texturemapped plasma rotator that, except for the low resolution,
 is nice and enjoyable. So is the tunnel/color zoomer routine that is on
 afterwards, looks like as if it is about 18 bit, or else it's just a good
 choice of palette (both concerning the choice of colors and the shades).
 Next on is a fast voxel-rotine. One of the reasons why it is so fast, is
 that Incal uses parts of the screen for promoting the group by written
 it's name next to and below the voxel, but that doesn't matter, as it is
 a great routine that even rotates freely from side to side! And as always:
 The torus... A texturemapped phong torus that isn't too fast dances for a
 while on the screen, then six of them appear and form a ring. But
 fortunately we are moving to the next routine pretty fast afterwards.
 That's a flat-scape routine with both floor and ceiling using one of
 Cougar's famous dragon-pictures and one of Ra's creations as texture. As
 they say: They where low on time, and the readme-file even says that it's
 a 48 nonstop production. If that's true I must say that they've done a
 very good job, but if you should rip other people's work, then I don't
 think that you should actually use it in your own productions (not without
 an agreement with the author(s), anyway). But back to the routine: It
 rotates freely on all axis, is pretty fast and the resolution is a bit
 low. But all in all it's an impressive routine! The routine ends just to
 make room to the next and last routine in the demo: A nice texturemapped
 cube, with a different picture on each of its sides. For once the
 resolution is okay, and the speed is quite acceptable too.
 The music in the demo is a rather traditional piece of synth with some
 techno elements in it, and an "I-found-the-button-that-starts-the-drum-
 box-and-I-don't-want-to-touch-it-again"-rhythm... But it fits the demo
 well. Also the synth music that is on together with the endscroller is
 good, personally I like it very much (there's nothing like a piece of good
 synth). But again it's a rip (the end-music)! They sure must have had some
 problems with a deadline.

Conclusion: Highly recommended!

+ Nice 3D-scene and music
- Generally slow routines

Comment: It all starts with the credits which are shown with changing faces
 next to the names and nice plasma effects in the background. But after
 this the routines are generally a bit slow, I guess a '030-50 will be
 enough to make it run acceptably. But still all of the routines have been
 seen faster before... The next effect is a party twister, then a tunnel
 with "mountains" coming out of it sides, another plasma routine
 (rotating) and a nice picture by Deckard in the usual Deckard style.
 And now for something completely different: A 3D-scene rendered in a 3D
 program where a futurist plane bombs the Microsoft building. The color(s)
 are blue, the resolution is low, but it's pretty smooth and looks very
 realistic! Back to the (rest of) demo: Another env-phong torus, some
 bumpmap, a phong gun, some bobs (rarely seen in new demos, I wonder why)
 and finally: The endscroller with a bumpmap in the background. The
 routines are still pretty slow and everything has been seen better before.
 The music in the demo is a nice synth piece which changes to fit the 3D-
 scene and changes back when it's over, the end-music is some kind of
 triphop/synth mix.

Conclusion: Watch it to see the 3D-scene.

+ Good intentions...
- Slow routines

Comment: Somebody tries to make their computer do things that takes it to
 the limit of what is possible. Somebody has faster computers than others.
 You'll need a '060 or similar to run this demo at a decent speed, I guess!
 Anyway, except for the slow routines the demo is actually nice with well-
 chosen colors and nice effects. A 3D flatscape (a plain surface
 disappearing on the horizon) with a texture on it, a texture tunnel (still
 very slow), some indefinable lights are the contents of this demo.
 None of the effects are shown very long, but instead some of them are
 shown twice (or is similar) with a second texture. One worth mentioning
 is a 3D bumpscape, 3D bumpmap. Slow...
 The last routine is unlike the other routines not especially slow. It's a
 scroller where the letters are formed of lots of falling pixels, looks
 nice. The text moves very slow, but rather smooth.
 The music is a below average piece of techno with some synth tunes in it.

Conclusion: You don't need to see the demo, but I would recommend you to
 watch the scroller, though.

+ The music is quite good
- The routines are generally a bit slow, there are some strange brakes when
  loading some new parts, blitterscreen

Comment: It all begins with a digitized short movie, where we follow
 Darkhawk walking through the city, and shortly after entering an Irish
 pub (of course...). The quality is rather low, first of all it is shown
 in blitterscreen-mode (like most of rest of the demo, unfortunately).
 Second the frame-rate is too low to make a "convincing" movie (I guess
 it's about 5-6 frames/sec). A text that is faded in front of the "movie"
 tells the viewer what's going on and why. After entering the pub the
 camera zooms in on a beer mat - Kilkenny beer, naturally! The screen goes
 black and stays like that for a while (too long). The real routines start,
 now that we have reach the second part, with a big texturemapped cube (and
 I guess I don't have to mention that the texture is the Killkenny
 logo...). It runs, like the next couple of routines, in blitterscreen-
 mode, which doesn't look too nice, but helps improving the speed of the
 routines. But generally they could need even more speed than they gain
 from the blitterscreen. The fire-routine that is on next is quite fast,
 though, an in front of it some glass balls fly around, nice. The following
 routine would probably also be nice if it was a lot smoother, that is, you
 need a powerful CPU. It's a jelly texturemapped box flying around in a
 moving background. Afterwards we are in a cinema looking towards the
 screen, where an average picture by Bandy is shown, and shortly after the
 screen zooms and fills the entire screen (if you know what I mean). It
 seems as if they have trashed the Kilkenny-theme by now, but it is seen
 lots of times before that demos have nothing to do with their title, so
 why not...? On next is some kind of dark, blue pixel/fractal routine, a
 bit unexplainable, but probably nice if run on the right machine (fast!).
 Time for the greetings-part, a scrolltext written using bumpmap and two
 primitive lightsources. Afterwards a very slow 3D-mountain scene is
 presented. It's texturemapped too and the camera moves (of course) in any
 angle, but it's way too slow to be nice. A big picture by Bifrost is
 scrolled up and down, and then an "interfering-rings" effect is on as the
 next one, two series of random moving circles are combined with some kind
 of plasma effect. This effect is shown later in the demo, but this time
 with a texturemap in the background. After this routine a new part is
 loaded causing a black screen, and they've even forgotten to remove the
 pointer! A texture mapped phong bowl is on next, followed by the credits-
 part: A box with the Iris-members on the side and the names shown in front
 of it, one by one. Cute. The end-part is cute too. At first it's a plain
 Kilkenny logo with background that scrolls around on the screen, but
 slowly the plain is made bumpy, just like looking through a very old
 window. In front of all this some last words are written.
 The music is in the main-part a good and melodic piece of synth, in the
 end-part it's still synth, but this time atmospheric. The pictures in the
 demo are of mixed quality, but never better than good.

Conclusion: Not a must see.

Note: Kilkenny is (if you should have missed it) an Irish beer (or Iris

+ Nice routine, pretty good music
- It's short, sudden ending (is that an error in my copy!?)

Comment: Silent synth tunes floats out of the speakers while a pretty good
 voxel landscape is on. One of those that rotates 360°, all the way round.
 The colors are gray and green mostly, the part of the landscape that are
 closest to you tends to be build of to big blocks, but it isn't a disaster
 as the rest of it looks pretty good. In front of it all the credits are
 shown with a funky hand drawn font. This sequence is rather long, but that
 is quite okay as it is atmospheric and nice in general. But suddenly the
 tempo really changes, turbo-mode is on and the landscape shows that it is
 able to turn 360° on all axis, not just on X! Great! Of course also the
 music is changed, both in style and tempo, it's an okay piece of techno
 that fits the show pretty well. Afterwards a tunnel is on, one of those
 "flower-shaped" ones. It's gray, but with a mainly green stripe of light
 running down its sides. Nice too! Also the next effect is some kind of
 tunnel, but you only get to see a bit of it because it's so dark. In
 front of this a jelly phong object with a lot of tentacles sticking out of
 it is present, nice! Also the speed is good. A picture is shown
 afterwards, at first it's grey-scale only, later the colors are turned on
 so half of the picture is in colors. Strange, but not as strange as what
 happens next: The demo suddenly ends, the music is just cut off. Very
 strange, they were doing so well, and then this!? Must be an error in my
 copy?! Any one knows?

Conclusion: Worth having a look at! I simply don't understand about that
 ending?

- Short, sudden ending

Comment: The remix of Kolor is quite different from the original @{" Kolor " link "Kolor"}
 demo. It's faster, the changes happen more often and the music is
 completely different, as it is a piece of funky rock, a pretty good one
 too (the question is if it fits to the demo's rather dark atmosphere).
 And of course there's similarities, for example the nice voxel landscape
 spinning around all axis (great!), and the very fast 3D-tunnel that are in
 the end of the show. You are flying with a great speed forward and
 backward through this flower-shaped tunnel looking on its sides.
 Of new stuff is a metallic phong box with sides that bulge both in and
 out. And even better (I think): A bumpmapped, colored, rotating, zooming
 texture, looks really great! As mentioned before the fast, green tunnel is
 in the end of the demo. Suddenly it changes to read colors, while credits
 are shown in front of it. And suddenly the show ends without further
 notice or anything. The same as the original @{" Kolor " link "Kolor"} demo!?

+ Some good routines
- Some primitive routines

Comment: While the heavy music makes its way out through the speakers, one
 routine after another is shown fast after eachother. At first we're on a
 little journey through a flatshaded city. Looks okay but is nothing
 special. Then it's time for some 3D objects jerking around, this routine
 is pretty fast. Next effect is a lightsourced cube with a picture on its
 sides. You see a little object representing the light flying around it.
 The cube isn't very big, but the routine is on the other hand very smooth.
 Looks great. The music changes into a synth/techno piece and it's time for
 a classic doom-routine, a pretty okay one too, which leads us to the next
 effect: A spinning bouncing ball. Nice and fast. Back to the 3D objects,
 time for the env-mapped. They're pretty smooth, but a little small and
 square. Yet another journey through a flatshaded city, this time fog is
 all-over, so that you can only see the buildings near you. Finally: The
 torus. Big, ugly and flatshaded...

 a row of triangles which is zoomed towards you so that they forms some

+ Multitasking (!), some nice routines
- Slow phongs and other ugly things

Comment: The show starts with some kind of light balls that moves around in
 random patterns. When they hit each other they become brighter, but
 unfortunately (for DP & SR) this routine has been done much better before.
 It's not pretty. Then we are told that this demo is actually multitasking!
 And it is, pressing Amiga-M brings you back to the system! Other coders
 could learn something here. Then there are credits and after that some
 slow and buggy phong, then a bump-mapped cube and an env-mapped phong pig,
 no torus this time! A pretty pretty plasma is the next routine, the
 colors could have been better though, and after that a tunnel, but it is
 only the first part of the tunnel that is illuminated, so you're unable to
 take a deep look into it - it's just dark, however, the speed is good.
 More phong is on, this time a wheel from a car (without the tire), a very
 buggy phong twister and a lot of blue balls (last mentioned routine is
 extremely slow!). And that's it. In between some of the routines some
 pictures by DRD (whose name has nothing to do with my name!) are shown.
 The original pictures are at least 16 bit pictures hi-res, but here they
 are converted to 256 colors and a lower resolution, and of course the
 originals are much better than the ones in this demo. Too bad they are
 converted. The music starts as an atmospheric piece of synth, but is later
 changed into average techno music.

Conclusion: Not recommended. About everything has been seen better.

Note: The demo is available both as chip-ram only version and in a version

+ Some nice plasma
- Lots of things that aren't nice

Comment: This demo is short, contains only few routines and all of it is
 plasma. The first plasma is lowres and has some ugly blue colors, the
 second one is also lowres, but looks okay anyway as it's made with a dark
 palette with on bright line in it. The last plasma is actually good, it's
 a picture of a face that is mirrored, and it's both fast and the
 resolution is good. The music is a piece of techno and isn't time well to
 the rest.

Conclusion: Watch another.

- Has not really anything to with a demo

Comment: This is a cartoon rather than a demo. It consists of small
 sequences of cartoon that has about nothing to do with each other. The
 style of drawing is cute, though. The music is a tuba added with different
 sound effects, sounds terrible but matches the rest...
 When it's over it restarts, but you can end it with the mouse.

 something to make this demo work. A cartoonish (magical?!) box with a
 crank in its side is shown. By moving the mouse you can make the box play
 some sounds, it's not a jukebox though... But be careful! It might be a
 bit fragile... After that there's a small @{" tower " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Magical.GIF"} with half a bridge coming

+ Very fast phong, generally very nice routines
- Compared to the standard it lacks design

Comment: Essence - the world's most dangerous group - that's what they say
 about themselves. And this demo is really "dangerous": It contains some
 of the fastest phong ever made (compared to CPU power)! The music which
 is some kind of techno with hiphop drums fits the demo, which starts with
 some pictures of the authors and an "Explicit Lyrics" sign, there's no
 singing in the demo, though. After that there's a routine which is some
 kind of plasma formed in the shape of a flower (anyone has a better
 explanation? Well, just watch the demo to find out what I mean...). Then
 the phongy part starts: A gigantic (...) envmapped 3D object moves
 steadily across the screen, runs completely smooth on a '030-50! But you
 don't really know what I mean before you've seen it! After that some oval
 texturemapped balls bounces around. The texture is made so that it looks
 like there is a lightsource, but there isn't. Fake, but anyway, it looks
 very nice. Then there's more phong! A beautiful black rabbit
 (naturalistic) and the old moon (not very realistic, but in a very fancy
 cartoonish style). Nice and fast. Plasma is used in different ways, in
 some kind of tunnel, twisting around and twisting a @{" picture " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Makaveli_Dog.Gif"}. Well done!
 Of course (!?) there's more phong, this time another big object that
 reflects itself in it, I guess! All phongs are in a pretty high
 resolution, which makes it look much better than "ordinary" phong. The
 last effect is an Essence logo in 3D with blur slowly moving around on the
 screen, afterwards an average picture, a little messy but with some nice
 details, is shown. The demo ends. One of the best demos in 1996, I'm sure!

Conclusion: Watch this one! One of the best productions in 1996!

+ Multitasking, nice phongs, good music
- Short, only one routine, the mouse pointer is on

Comment: A very short demo with only one routine in it, a nice phong
 routine that shows three or four different objects (blob, chess piece,
 star) shown with some kind of brown mapping on them (or just a good
 mixed palette). In between these objects are some poems that are shown too
 fast to be read (and often backwards), and while the objects are on the
 credits are used as background picture. Best of all is that it multitasks,
 and also the funky combination of jazz, funk and heavy hiphop drums is a
 success, especially the horn in it is good. Unfortunate that this demo is
 so short, it could have been something!

Conclusion: Too bad it's so short, what's in it is good!

+ Almost all of the routines are fast and pretty nice, nice graphic
- Was disqualified at Assembly '96!

Comment: Starts with a very nice logo, a little difficult to read. A very
 nice voxel landscape with a texture on it takes over the screen, much
 cooler than the ordinary voxel routines! Then it's time for a pretty nice
 texture tunnel, held in one color. One of the original effects is an
 kaleidoscope like effect (similar to the one in those small paper/tin
 pipes you had when you where younger, where you looked into one end and
 saw the most beautiful patterns...).
 The next routine, a bouncing ball with a texture on it, is a bit slow (but
 acceptable). Time for a plasma and pretty fast phong object (lowres).
 Something looking a bit like fractals morphs around into different shapes.
 It's fast, but the resolution is low. Another plasma, this one is a very
 colorful one. At last there's some morphing gouraud objects moving and
 twisting around in eachother, not to forget the end-scroller: The Star
 Wars wannabe scroller. It's a little ugly, especially compared to Star
 Wars scrollers in many other demos. The pictures shown in between some of
 the routines are generally nice. The music is an OK synth/techno piece.
 Why this demo was disqualified is a mystery to me!

Inside information: Was disqualified by the jury selecting the demos at the
 Assembly '96! The reason why, is (source: ROM 8): "Eye Q & Stargazer, both
 jury experts, thought that the Ram Jam contribution was way too ugly to
 present to the masses". I don't understand that (neither do Ram Jam and
 many others)! This demo is good! If it really IS true that that was what
 happened, they (the jury) should leave the Scene forever (or stop being
 bribed!)!

+ Different, funny
- I think this demo is close to reaching its goal: To be entertaining, so
  nothing particular negative, no quit

Comment: This demo was a real hit when it appeared on the Scene, and now it
 has become a legendary demo more or less! This production was something
 completely new from all other demos at that time, as it isn't based much
 on the routines, more on the graphic, sound and funny entertainment. And
 the legendary Budbrains have reached their goal.
 It starts with a guru...! But don't worry, it's just one of the Budbrain's
 loony ideas. Then the credits are shown, slowly one by one with an odd
 font and colors, while some screaming, but in a way quiet, scary tunes are
 heard floating out from the speakers. A scroller appears, and in the HD
 install I have you have to click the mouse to avoid a crash in this part,
 so I did. Afterwards the first part of a weird little movie, a cartoonish
 animation, is shown. Another funny animation is shown before the next part
 of the movie, and in between this movie part and the movie's last part is
 one of the only parts of the demo that contains effects, the infamous
 Kaos-part! The music is a remix of Dr. Baker's Kaos techno hit, and on the
 screen a lot of line patterns are shown creating beautiful (?) shapes.
 Also simple pictures and the like are shown in short flashes. If you click
 the mouse you'll proceed to the last part of the movie (what an ending!),
 and after that is over one of my favorite parts in on, probably the cutest
 demo part ever in any demo! Three eggs hatch and in them are three cute
 chickens. The middle one starts to sound like a cool drum rhythm, and soon
 the two other chickens start to fall into the rhythm. But you have to see
 it to understand. The second and last coded (that is, with real effects)
 part in the demo is a scroller made from vector bobs. They fly around in
 a half circle over the horizon making different kind of movement.
 Unfortunately this part is a bit trashed in the HD-version, but still it's
 pretty nice. The last part, except for the endscroller is the so called
 Hustler part, inspired by Hustler magazines. It's a slideshow with black
 humor pictures where the topic is concentrated on body parts below the
 waist... And very funny (Parental advisory)! Everytime a new picture is
 shown a crowd of laughing people are heard, and you are probably going to
 join them. The endtext is slowly scrolled across the screen accompanied by
 a great silent tune.

Conclusion: A true classic demo! If you haven't seen it yet, watch it! If
 you have seen it, watch it again!

+ Good music, funny
- Short, can't compete with the first @{" Megademo " link "Megademo"}, no quit

Comment: Budbrain's second and last demo, and unfortunately it can't really
 compete with the first megademo's high level of humor which is what holds
 up this kind of demos, however it isn't bad at all! It is based more on
 the code than the first megademo, but still graphic, music and humor are
 in focus. For example the first part of the demo where Madonna is killed
 in the shower. We don't get to see the killer (yet), just his hand holding
 the knife. The sound is brilliant with the short, precise strings
 everytime the poor singer is cut, and the graphic is (as always in
 Budbrain demos) comic style. After this little animated sequence the words
 "Sorry Crionics" is written all over the screen, which must be a hint to
 Crionics Madonna demo... The first code part is on next. In the background
 is a starfield scrolling across the screen, while letters are zoomed in
 different ways to the screen, sometimes rotated, often not in the right
 order. Looks great. The music in this part is atmospheric, at first it's
 just sounds of the wind that is heard, later it changes to a good piece
 of Dr. Baker inspired techno. Next part is just some simple plasma figures
 in top of the screen, while a scrolltext is in the bottom of the screen.
 The part after that one is a bit more entertaining, it's the techno part
 where a good piece of techno is played while different, simple routines
 are shown in MTV style, that are fast changes. A trial is shown as the
 next thing when you click the mouse. While a newspaper informs you that
 Madonna's killer is found the theme from Twinpeaks is played... Who the
 murderer is I won't write here, but you will be surprised! The demo ends
 with a stylish end, beautiful fonts and logos and a good relaxed endtune.
 Unfortunately you can't quit the demo by mouse, a reset is needed.

Conclusion: A classic, very enjoyable!

+ Nice routines, nice pictures
- Lacks transitions, a few routines demands a lot of CPU power

Comment: If you read the text file that comes with the demo, you'll find
 out that Artwork claims that this demo was put together at the party-place
 with the leftovers from @{" Exit Planet Dust " link "ExitPlanetDust"} released shortly before
 Symposium-Mekka. And I'm willing to believe that, it looks a lot like it.
 It's the usual Artwork style with yellow/orange/brown colors and a lot of
 smooth phong objects. The changes between the different routines are still
 just a fade, and all in all you could compare it to a coke: It's nice in
 the beginning, but starts getting boring after a while. When you're
 finish the container is empty (anyone got that?)... Well, enough thinking
 (or whatever you'd like to call it), let's get on with the show: The first
 thing you notice are the numbers that are placed in three columns on the
 screen. Could it be design? No, it's not. Rumors say that Artwork simply
 forgot to remove their on-screen (de)bugger (or what ever that is) before
 handing in the demo. Luckily you can turn it off yourself by clicking the
 left mouse button. After the credits have scrolled unsmoothly across the
 screen, the title is shown. The background slowly moves, and that goes for
 the rest of the demo whenever possible. The first "real" routine is of
 course a fast phong object, texturemapped I guess. A fade later we're
 flying through some kind of tunnel that consists of a random grid, through
 the holes you can see the slowly moving background (as I said before: It's
 on whenever possible). Afterwards a plasma of the kind that focuses on the
 middle is shown, very nice. A new kind of tunnel is the next routine. It's
 a bit slow and looks pretty much different from any other tunnels because
 of its texture. Pretty nice. After that a plate is on. Not just an
 ordinary plate, a head seems to try to break through the plate. By the
 way, it's phong, a bit slow, unoriginal, but pretty nice after all. More
 phong is what the next routine is about too: A object with a transparent
 hemisphere on each side slowly makes it way through cyberspace.
 Unsmoothly, a fast CPU is recommended here! Next routine looks as if you
 took some different flashlights and pointed them towards a piece of mat
 looking metal. A bit like bumpmap, except for there are no bumps (which is
 an important difference). After another plasma routine a very nice picture
 by Fiver is shown, then a strange routine with a small plate that emits
 smoke, pretty nice, but a bit slow. Then there's more phong, and for once
 the object is worth to explain: Looks much like the "traditional" 3D stars
 used in many other demos except for that the "arms" or tentacles are cut
 of and are hoovering next to the body, not locked in their position. Nice!
 A short scene with beams of lights coming from the floor is on next, but
 is in a hurry taken over by a nice texturemapped 3D pyramid with
 spotlights placed around it, very nice. The last effect is of course a
 phong, a texturemapped, transforming blob. Much can be said about Artwork,
 but they sure know how to make a good phong!
 The music is a some kind of ballad with some electronic sounds added.
 Would fit well into an exciting movie, and is okay for the demo too.

Conclusion: Surely worth having a look at!

+ Good old classic!
- Of course you can see the age...

Comment: At that time in the "good old Scene days" this demo was HOT! But
 compared to the demos of today it's getting pretty cold. The effects in
 it are (of course) rather primitive, but running at a A1230 they are very
 smooth (I don't know if it'll run as smooth on a A500).
 Different kinds of vector graphic are the main contents, for example a lot
 of small vector objects run in different patterns and with colors across
 the screen. Looks nice! In the background of most of the routines there's
 a 2D starfield, and between the effects there's a text presenting the next
 one. In the last parts of the demo it's different. Other effects worth
 mentioning is a vector scroller which scrolls (in 2D) over a mountain, so
 that the text forms a circle. Later it bounces and twists in 3D. Really
 nice! A Star Wars like scroller and a 3D floor with bouncing balls jumping
 towards you are some of the last effects. The demostyle music doesn't fit
 the demo too well, the graphic (some text) has style.
 The demo is rather long, "young" sceners would probably get pretty bored
 watching, the old sceners would probably shed a tear, while remembering
 the "good old days"...

Conclusion: For the old sceners.

+ Nice phong routines + other pretty good ones, colorful
- Minor complaints about some routines, could need some nice changes
  between some of the routines.

Comment: This is one of the most colorful demos I've ever seen. Right from
 the beginning there are all the colors of the rainbow present in the
 group's name. The credits are presented with some plasma, tunnel and 3D-
 flatscapes in the background constantly changing its colors, the last one
 mentioned is the nicest. Next routine is a nice phong key which might
 sound pretty ordinary, but it looks like that the picture is a little out
 of focus, a bit blurred. Later the key starts to get really blurred with a
 long slowly disappearing tail after it. Then the key is gone and a picture
 by HP is shown. His technique is good, but the motive is pretty
 unoriginal (a girl lying in a bed), and worst of all: It doesn't fit the
 demo very well. In an pretty unsuccessful change routine we see for a
 short moment a primitive bumpmap, but after that there's a great routine:
 A phong! At first it's just an ordinary transparent coin-shaped phong with
 a smiling face on its sides. But soon a nice texture fades in, so that
 it's no longer transparent and finally a lightsource is added. Looks
 great! The coder (and the graphician) of the phong routines in this demo
 has hit the right spot, somehow he manages to make the phong look
 realistic! The screen is superimposed (or picture morphed if you like
 that expression better) to a LED-logo with a transparent phong glass
 flying in front of it. It disappears and a background picture which looks
 like a colorful tunnel is on. In front of it is a morphing phong object.
 It morphes from being a cube to a sea urchin (one of those small sharp
 things on the bottom of the sea) and back again a couple of times. It
 flies away and a black pool ball (no. 8...) enters the screen. Suddenly it
 copies itself. And again, and again and so on. Another LED logo is on,
 this time a transparent one with some kind of stretching plasma in the
 background. And the last routine are two bumpmapped dolphins with two
 different colored lightsources, this one is much nicer than the other
 bumpmap in the demo, but the resolution is a bit low. The music through
 the main part of the demo is a fast, simple (primitive?) piece of techno
 which is well timed to the demo, but somehow I don't think it fits. The
 music in the end part is the kind you hear in the supermarket which must
 be the opposite to techno. Not a good combination...
 I wonder how they've managed not to make the endscroller smooth scrolling,
 they've managed to make the rest of the demo pretty smooth...

Conclusion: See it at least ones in your life!

+ Nice and fast routines, nice changes
- Low resolution in most of the routines, sudden end

Comment: A logo is faded in, the melodic synth/demo-music starts and the
 demo has begun for real. A trip over a fast, but low-res fullscreen voxel
 landscape, bring you in the mood for speed, not that it moves extremely
 fast, it's just fast, smooth and nice (except for the low-res thing). The
 title is shown, and is taken over by a texture plasma, with a woman's face
 used as texture, and as before the resolution is low, but the speed and
 smoothness good, and this goes for almost all the routines (so I won't
 write any more about it). A rather good picture is shown afterwards (the
 resolution is good - whoops... :-)). A big cube with the model's face on
 its sides in the next moving thing. It seems to be in lack of colors. It's
 quite nice anyway, but the best part is the change from this routine to
 the Doom-routine which is on next: The cube stops spinning, and then we
 see that it is a texture on a wall. The same thing repeats when the Doom-
 routine is over, the other way, naturally: A fractal is hanging on the
 wall and we go close enough to letting it cover the entire screen which
 makes the fractal zoomer start! Great! And the fractal zoomer is in fact
 at least as great as the changes! It just keeps zooming and zooming and
 there seems to be no end of that fractal (of course...). It's very fast,
 and it doesn't matter that much that the resolution is low (however, it
 would have been nice if it was better so that you could see more details,
 but I guess we have to wait for the A\Box!?). Another nice change leads
 us to a blur zoom routine, where a lot of colors coming from a thing are
 zoomed towards us. Looks quite nice. The last routine is a bit strange,
 you're slowly moving around 7-8 gouraud shaded (weird shading, anyway)
 boxes, the colors are odd (looks as if too few has been used) and nothing
 really happens. Untill the demo is cut of in a sudden exit. To bad such a
 nice production should end this way...

Conclusion: Highly recommended!

+ Some nice routines
- Uses blitterscreen, one very ugly routine

Comment: First of all: Almost all routines are shown using blitterscreen
 which doesn't look very nice.
 It all starts out with some zooming planets (nice), after that there's a
 @{" face " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/MindProbe1.GIF"} rising from the ocean in 3D. This face twists and twirls and is
 actually quite cool. Then we're flying over a 3D landscape (I guess it's
 vectors with textures), and into a (nice) @{" tunnel " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/MindProbe4.GIF"}, which turns out to be a
 labyrinth of some kind. Suddenly there's a cube with a picture on its
 sides (we're still in the tunnel) and a little spotlight on it coming from
 inside the cube. So we enter and see a disco-ball spinning around! Cool!
 The music ranges from hardcore techno to soft dreamy synth-tunes and fits
 the demo pretty good. Next effect is some @{" fruits " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/MindProbe3.GIF"} (phong) landing in a
 bowl. This part is a little too long. Next routine: A picture (Climber,
 No. 2 at TP5 by Rodney) moves around as background, a cube with the same
 picture on the sides spins around and an RGB-cube spins around through
 the other cube. Nice! Then there's some @{" phong-fish " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/MindProbe2.GIF"} swimming around, and
 last one of the ugliest routines ever! They call it "real voxel trace",
 and it might be hard to code and so on, but it's very ugly too!

Conclusion: Not the "usual" TBL quality, but definately worth having a look
 at.

+ Very nice design, the music fits well
- The routines are old fashioned, doesn't run with AGA, you can't quit it

Comment: I remember two things especially well about this demo: 1) The nice
 design and 2) Most of it is in hi-res. Actually I also remember that it
 doesn't run with AGA, so you have to disable that first (if you got it),
 and that you can't quit as it kills the system completely... But, let's
 have a look at the horse: When you start it a nice picture is shown for a
 long time (while it decrunches I suppose). Then the demo starts with
 something that looks like a countdown to the start of a film, but instead
 of numbers Andromeda welcomes you to the demo. A simple, but very nice
 change changes the scene to a scroller which runs sideways and down at the
 same time, actually there are three scrollers presenting each a word or
 two, and the text is transparent. The title is shown. After that there's a
 transparent, morphing, five bitplanes vector object moving smoothly.
 Impressive, huh? Well, it was once... The same could be said about the
 next routine, six circles changing their width while spinning around
 another circle. Realtime calculated. The next routine is actually nice.
 It's "laserlines" as they call it, a box with a box inside it, with a box
 inside it, with a box inside, with a box inside it, with a box inside it,
 where the box in the center moves a little later than the box around it,
 which moves a little later than the box around it, which moves a little
 later than the box around it... At the same time the biggest box changes
 its size so that it becomes the smallest box and vice versa. After that
 there's something that is called a twistwire - the versions of this
 routine we know today is a party twister (a 3D bar being twisted). The
 twistwire is only in 2D, though, but still it's lightsourced. In the
 bottom of the screen there's a scroller informing you about the current
 routine (that's why I know the routine's names...). Time for some
 raytrace! Not realtime, though, but still it looks pretty great! It's a
 12 frame HAM (Hold-and-Modify, that is 4096 colors on ECS and older GFX
 chipsets) animation that can't be explained, you have to see it for
 yourself. After that a mirror flies above the Andromeda logo and mirrors
 it (that's what mirrors do!). The last routine is actually pretty
 impressive (especially for a A500), it's again a box, but this time with
 some kind of simple tunnel on its sides. The scrolltext in the bottom in
 the screen starts scrolling very unsmooth, though. And then there's the
 endscroller which is pretty much fucked up in my copy. That's why there
 are some people missing in the credit list. Anyone knows who?
 The colors in the demo is pastel colors, soft and friendly for the eye.
 The music is a quiet, laid-back piece of pop with a nice theme in it.

+ Nice phong and bumpmap routines, nice design
- A little variation would be nice, low resolution

Comment: Acid trip! Put on sun glasses before watching this demo, the
 colors are vivid! It starts with a nice logo. Some atmospheric ear-
 ripping sounds are heard. Then the show starts. An env-mapped phong and
 a nice background, both with the vivid colors, twists and turns for a
 moment. The atmospheric sound has turned into a piece of hardcore techno
 which is well timed to the display. The background disappears, so that the
 phong can be blurred, which looks nice. Also the credits consists of
 phong. The names are shown in one side of the screen, while their task is
 faded over each other in the other side of the screen. While showing
 credits the background is back on. Next up is another phong (surprise!):
 The background moves around faster and faster, while a box morphes so that
 it gets holes in its sides. Then it falls apart piece by piece! Very nice
 Indeed! The changes into new routines are generally nice and the music is
 not as hardcore later in the demo as in the first parts (but still pretty
 hard). And then an unwritten rule (?) is broken: A picture of a naked
 woman is shown, and you can see her equipment...! Doesn't fit too well
 into the demo either. Well, next up are some very nice bumpmap routines (I
 think its bumpmap). At first a 3D coin with a face on the sides is shown.
 Then a phong banana (and a joke...). Then an env-bumpmap is on (very nice)
 and after that a bumpmapped 3D-scape is shown. Looks excellent! This demo
 is highly recommended, but it needs a little variation. The phong and bump
 are nice (the 2x2 resolution is okay), but...

Conclusion: Wow! Put on your sun glasses!

+ Fast routines
- Primitive/simple routines, gets boring

Comment: After starting this thing from Shell a window opens with a scroll-
 text in it, telling the truth about the new Amigas (the AGA machines),
 this is not mend as a joke, it's pure facts about the hardware, and a
 hidden hate towards Commodore, I guess...? You have to start the demo
 from the menu bar! And when do that you're on with the demo: The first
 routine is a quite cute one, where a ball rolls in the bottom of the
 screen, while the bottom is affected by the laid-back demo music, so that
 it sometimes makes some small bumps causing the ball to be thrown up into
 the air. Every time it hits the ceiling or the walls they'll flash.
 After that another ball is on, this time a fast pixel ball that gets
 darker the longer it's away from the screen. Afterwards we're presented to
 a fast, but low-res zoom-routine, next up is more pixel routines, among
 others a tunnel, all fast and nice, but maybe too simple to keep one's
 attention. Also there are different kinds of plasma, both normal and
 texture plasma (one with a simple animated cartoon dinosaur). Worth
 mentioning is a zooming kaleidoscope, though, only with few colors used.
 And the demos continues with the same effects again and again, change
 them a little and then show them again. Monotone. In the end it loops
 and starts all over again.

Conclusion: Not really anything to see here.

Comment: I guess you all have seen The Black Lotus' @{" Tint " link "Tint"}, No. 1 at TG'95,
 if not: Do it! The Blue Locomotive (if you wonder about that name try

 few and old routines (pixel routine, simple plasma and even a little
 vector torus), but of course it's not mainly the code that has to be
 seen, it's the text which is the funny part if you've watched @{" Tint " link "Tint"}. The
 music is a little chip tune version of the last module in @{" Tint " link "Tint"}, composed
 by Azazel, and both the original and the chip tune are nice.

+ All effects are fast
- The design isn't good, the music neither

Comment: I guess this is one of TBL's worst productions. And it isn't that
 bad, just a little... It begins with a ball with six light spots mounted
 on its side (like the ones they've got in discotheques) spinning around
 lightning up the walls in the box that it is in. Fast. The credits are
 shown afterwards with a primitive, but fast, rotator in the background.
 Doesn't look very nice, but it doesn't last long. The next routine reminds
 me of good old Turrican, where a welder cuts through the screen (looks
 that way!). The only difference, I guess, is that this time it spells
 TBL with big cartoonish/graffiti-like letters. The hardcore techno music
 which has been on until now is replaced by a more silent piece of techno.
 Doesn't sound too good, and doesn't fit the demo well either. Something
 that looks a bit like fire is up next. Different simple line objects are
 rotated with some kind of fire-effect. Doesn't look like real fire at all,
 more like big pixels, still it looks okay. The scene changes to gouraud
 shaded boxes flying through each other while more and more boxes appear.
 Furthermore there's a moving lightsource, and it is a bit buggy. After
 a big blue ball, which is on after the gouraud boxes, a strange plasma
 appears. Most of it is black, and the only thing you can see is the out-
 lines of some figures melting together like metaballs. Strange... The
 next effect is shadeclusters or something similar, not too nice, but maybe
 they are supposed to look that way. Later there's a small party twister
 with two balls flying around and through it. Nice, except for the color
 combination (pink and grey) and the size. More gouraud is up next, almost
 the same as before. The difference is that these boxes have textures on
 their sides, else the difference is the same. In the bottom of the screen
 while the gouraud effect is on there's a little cartoon character, this
 character is used as texture in the fast plasma routine that is on next.
 Some texts are on (greetings) and finally the last effect has been
 reached: A strange tunnel, unlike most other tunnels the sides aren't
 smoothed. Instead the walls are covered with random, big dots. Watch it
 yourself! This routine is on for a long time, while the music, which is
 now some kind of industrial techno, constantly runs in the same loop.
 And finally it ends.

Conclusion: Considering that it's a TBL demo you could get disappointed

+ Nice (but (a little) slow) water-routine
- Generally slow routines

Comment: Must have been a small party since it was placed 2nd... Most of
 routines are a little too slow to be nice (for example a rotating texture-
 tunnel, a "party twister" and some nice but slow "rings in water"
 effects). Furthermore there's a transparent skull and a plasma-like effect
 which is mirrored. The music is a piece of "dreamy" techno, the graphic is
 below average.

+ Smooth routine(s)
- Short, few routines

Comment: A little short, but pretty nice, production. It only contains
 one routine shown in different variations. It's a fast vector routine, but
 instead of just showing one object it shows lots of small objects, they
 don't move freely, though, but are locked to their position. First there's
 a lot of small boxes which you're flying around, then rotating x's, and
 finally both boxes and squares with holes in the middle.
 The music is a piece of funk with a nice flute lead.

+ Some nice picture twister routines
- Some old routines, an annoying piece of music

Comment: What's most of in this demo is model's faces exposed to some nice
 picture twister routines, for example a picture is placed on the surface
 of a ball and is moved around, the same picture is rotated, zoomed and/or
 reflected. A nice detail is that the girl blinks while she is rotated!
 Also nice is the transparent picture routine in the beginning of the show.
 Two pictures move around covering eachother, but still you're able to see
 both.
 Sometimes there's a scroll text in the bottom of the screen, while the
 effect is running (just like the "good old days").
 Most of the demo consists of the picture effects, actually there's only
 one other effect: Some rather primitive balls (circles) in different
 colors flying around, and when covering eachother their color changes
 where they are covered. The music isn't that good, but then again, it's
 a question of taste (good and bad...). The pictures that are displayed
 sometimes when changing routine is average or below (and even though it's
 an AGA demo, it's ECS pics. The graphicians did not at the time the demo
 was made own an AGA machine.

Conclusion: Have a look and judge for yourself.

Inside information: This is Cydonia's first release, and the first AGA demo
 released in Australia. It was supposed to be released under the Digital

+ Some nice effects
- You can see it's a bit old, some routines are slow, others very slow

Comment: It starts with some hand drawn text screens presenting the group
 and the title. The title screen itself is a nice picture. Then the real
 show starts: A big low-res cube with a lot of colors appears. It seems to
 be rather buggy, every second line is staggered from the other lines.
 Next routine is a weird, but nice plasma. The strange thing about is that
 it consists of slowly moving squares, so that it actually consists of
 these squares instead of just being one big floating mass. Afterwards two
 simple vector cubes are on, flying through each other, old school stuff.
 Some blurry, zooming lines are shown shortly after for a very short period
 of time, then another plasma is on, this time a fullscreen texture mapped
 one with a black/white picture used as texture. Unlike the first plasma
 this one is slow. On next is a wave routine: Imagine that you're drunk
 and look at a chess board from above - that's how it looks... Next effect
 is nice and classic: The worm hole. For you who don't know this I'll try
 to explain it. It's simply a whole in the middle of the screen seen from
 an oblique angle. A texture is zoomed down into this hole. And that's also
 what happens with this one. It's smooth and fast. And beautiful.
 Gouraud was obviously something rather new when this demo appeared,
 anyway, the next effect is a simple gouraud shaded box. The speed is okay,
 as long as they stick to the box, but when they replace it with a duck
 and after that a mask it's so very, very slow! So let's go to the next
 routine, which is a low-res zoomer/rotator with a picture of the monster
 in the film Predator. Except for the low resolution it's quite nice.
 Finally we have reached the credits which is zoomed into the screen, while
 a lot of small, jelly cubes appear in the background. Nice.
 The music is a pretty good demo/synth piece which fits the demo okay,
 without being exceptional.
 When the show ends the screen goes black and you have to reset to get on
 with your life...

Conclusion: Recommended because of a few nice routines

+ Nice effects
- Slow routines, sudden end

Comment: I might as well tell you now as later: This demo has some very
 nice looking routines! And I'll also tell you that these routines are
 slow! That is on a '030, I guess it looks okay on faster '0x0's. Anyway,
 the demo starts with changing from a red textscreen to a blue plasma-
 like thing of the kind that looks a bit like a tunnel. Also it looks a
 bit bumpmapped, but this could be due to the colors. The textscreens
 stops interrupting and the plasma thing, which is now red too, is on until
 it changes to a 3D tunnel! No black screen in between, it actually somehow
 transforms into this tunnel, and still it looks as if it's bumpmapped!
 Great, but (again) a bit slow. The tunnel transforms into something that
 looks as if a spot light is pointed towards you, and suddenly a picture
 with a similar looking background is put on, nice! After a scrolltext
 with a some greetings a texturemapped ball, which looks bumpmapped on one
 side (if you could say that about a ball). But like with the tunnel/plasma
 routine I don't think it's real bumpmap, the ball isn't, that's for sure.
 Still it looks okay, however, it wouldn't hurt to use another texture. All
 those red colors aren't that nice (not that I don't like red, but I think
 you'll agree with me when you've seen the demo). A plasma/wallwrap thing
 is shown for a short while afterwards, and then the Earth is on! Again a
 texturemapped ball, with a world map as texture. It seems as if they used
 exactly routine as the ball before, just putting on a nicer texture. They
 should have done that earlier. Anyway, except for the slow speed it looks
 quite good. Next routine is some kind of plasma split into fields that
 moves around, quite unexplainable! But nice! The next routine is a
 rotator, which I won't write much about, because the routine after that
 is a much more exciting rotator. It consists of several layers. Each layer
 consists of small pictures and some holes so that you can see the layer
 behind. While these layers rotate the "camera" is moving slowly around
 through the layers. This is very nice, except for the resolution which is
 low. Last routine is a very slow grayscale bumpmap with the group's name.
 The music is a mixture of Ambient and triphop, nothing special. Suddenly
 the demo ends, no fade or anything, just a cut. Shame!

Conclusion: Highly recommended, especially for people with processor better
 than '030

+ All routines are rather fast ('030-50MHZ), the few pictures shown are
  good, so is the music, original
- Some routines tend to have a bit "primitive" look, no quit

Comment: I remember this demo, or a part of it anyway, because of one
 reason: The Doom-routine in it. I was present at that party, and the
 Amigans where going wild when it was shown, even though it ran on a quite
 slow machine. But let's save it for later as it is the last routine in the
 demo. To start from the right end I'll mention the first thing that
 happens: A picture by Suny is shown, a very nice one too. After a while
 the demo starts with a zooming eye, is a bit "jumpy", and isn't on for a
 long time. The credits are up next and are shown with a nice, Doom-like
 routine. It can best be explained as a flight through a asteroid belt,
 where the asteroids are parts of walls, and are all on a vertical line.
 Looks pretty nice and is quite original too. After that a voxel landscape
 appears, it's bright on the top of the mountains, completely dark in the
 valleys and furthermore rather fast. It doesn't rotate, though, the next
 voxel does, and still the speed is good. In between these two voxel
 routines a flatscape that disappears in fog far away from the viewer is
 on. There are both floor and ceiling, and out of them come some big
 square blocks, so that the landscape is slowly covered with these
 "columns". There are no fancy textures or anything, just plain
 flatshading, still it's worth having a look at. Not to forget the "walker"
 that suddenly appears, has nothing to do with Escom's Walker, looks like a
 worm with a sucking disc in both ends, but it doesn't look nice without
 any shading or texture. After the before mentioned voxel, some kind of 3D-
 scene is shown. It consists of a lot of triangles put in circles, quite
 hard to explain. Still there's no shading or texture mapping. In front of
 these triangles a spiky phong object (I think) appears, this one is
 texture mapped. Nice. Also the next effect is quite good, a tunnel effect
 with no roof, but with mountain-like obstacles sticking out of its sides.
 And finally to the Doom-routine: It's pretty fast, runs in a square
 display field and the resolution is a bit low. We are having a nice little
 walk through the hallways and up of the stairs. The demo then ends with a
 nice picture by Trajan, then a slow scrolltext. The music is good, fits
 the demo well. It's demo-music of the best kind. During the endscroller
 it's a quiet ballad or something similar, Claws knows what he's doing!
 A funny "gimmick" is that you have the chance to test the Doom-routine
 for yourself afterwards using the mouse. When I did I fell down the stairs
 and ended up in a little hole with no exit... :)

Conclusion: A nice one! The whole team are all quite famous, and there are
 reasons for that. This is one of them.

Inside information: The Doom-routine are later used in a game, I believe it
                    was Fear.

+ Almost all routines are running 1x1 resolution, nice design, pictures and
  music
- You'll need a powerful processor to make it run smoothly, but still it's
  worth watching with a fast '030

Comment: The Impulse members play with their muscles with this great, but
 processor hungry, production! Actually I can't really find any negative
 things about this demo, except for the needed raw power, but still it's a
 good demo running on a fast '030, don't try it on '020! Almost all effects
 are running in 1x1 resolution, which is the main reason for being so
 hungry. It all starts with a little "3D-scene", where you see a door at
 the end of a hallway. The walls and the door are texture mapped and the
 room is slowly spinning around, while different nice phong objects are
 entering the screen (an old television, an airplane and a hammer?!).
 Next routine is a red tunnel where you feel that you're really close to
 the walls, and in one corner you see exactly the same routine in a little
 window, which also happens with some of the later routines. Untill now the
 show is good, but the next thing that happens is a real "killer": In the
 background a big MC-chip (a '030 to be precise) is spinning around while
 in the foreground a big phong head enters the screen, but that's only the
 start. The next thing that happens is that in a flash the scene changes to
 a phong man, and after another flash we are back to the head that now
 begins to be wrenched and twisted. Great! The same happens afterwards to
 the man, and this particular object looks very odd when getting his arms
 and legs stretched like that! A more or less sudden cut ends this, the
 good techno/synth music changes to another similar piece, and a zoom
 routine is on slowly zooming a picture away from the viewer. After a while
 you can see that it's a man with a lot of muscles in his arms, must be one
 from the Impulse crew :-)! Also the credits are shown now, in front of the
 zooming picture. Afterwards a spider is shown for a short while, then a
 great effect with a phong box with waving surfaces enters the screen and
 gets really close to the "camera". An eye is used as background, and when
 the box exits we are zooming closer to the eye, and see that a man is
 mirrored in it, wow! Shortly after the cube returns and just to make it
 interesting you enter the cube, so that you see it from the inside.
 Another phong object (a spiky object) is hidden in the middle of the cube,
 and it is mirrored in the cubes sides which are still waving. Looks really
 great! Also the next routine is impressive, not so much because of what's
 going on, but because it's running in hi-res lace, still at an acceptable
 speed. The background is a colorful picture of some mountains, while in
 the foreground a strange env-mapped (I think) object is flying around.
 The next two effects are gouraud, a locomotive and a torus, last mentioned
 with some really wierd colors. Not to interesting compared to the rest of
 the show, including one of the last routines in the demo, some kind of 3D-
 scene where you see a lot of gear wheels with silhouttes of men walking
 on them. Cool! The demo ends with two very good pictures, one by Beast
 (which is his only contribution to this demo, but what a contribution),
 and one by Rendall. Finally a scrolltext is on, would have been boring if
 it wasn't for the dolphins jumping around in the background, landing in
 the water that reacts pretty much like water and so on, all in 3D of
 course. The music in the last part is, like the music in the rest of the
 demo, good, it's a combination of strings and quiet beat.

Conclusion: Should be in your collection for sure!

+ Nice dust effect
- No design, 3D texture objects need lots of CPU power

Comment: A pretty average demo, lacks design, but some of the routines are
 nice, though. The (1x1) 3D env-mapped mask (original) is slow on my
 computer, but it probably looks great on a faster computer ('060?).
 One of my favourite effects is a "dust in light"-routine, you see a lot
 of white and gray pixels slowly morphing/flying around, looks like dust
 in a sun beam (you know, those bright things that come into the house and
 wake you up, if you've forgotten to draw the curtain at daytime...).
 Later there's a fast tunnel (the display only uses every second pixel),
 an unexplainable routine with some moving colors (a bit like plasma),
 later this routine is transparent, so that you can see more unexplainable
 colors beneath it, and a plane ground routine which is rather messy.
 About half of the routines are shown in "high-screen" (widescreen turned
 90°). The music is a mystic (...) piece of trance/ambient, a different
 tune, but not bad.

Conclusion: Have a look at some of the routines, forget the others (unless
 your CPU is fast enough).

+ Some nice routines
- Lacks transitions, traditional

Comment: There's something about this demo that prevents me from liking it.
 I guess it's the rather dark colors and the lack of transitions, but still
 it's difficult to point out exactly what it is. Still, there are some nice
 routines, okay music and graphic.
 The first routine is a phong object that is mirrored in the water below
 it, sometimes it even dives into the water, but no waves or the like
 appear. A picture with the group's name on it, a quite unreadable one, is
 shown afterwards and then melts away, looks nice. Next on is one of the
 demo's different kinds and variations of tunnels, all of them are quite
 fast and in a low resolution (2x2). The thing that really saves this one
 is the transparent title that suddenly appears in front of it, while the
 tunnel changes from red to blue. Next one is a plasma effect designed to
 look like a tunnel, also this routine is saved by transparent effect, this
 time they've just put two transparent plasmas on the screen. A bit
 confusing, though. The techno music now changes to the sound of the sea
 and seagulls and a good water effect is shown. It really looks much like
 water, except for the low resolution. This effect is seen from above, but
 afterwards we are located under water where we see the water effect from
 below, and the reflections on the sandy bottom, or whatever it is. I can't
 stop thinking about The Black Lotus' @{" Captured Dreams " link "CapturedDreams"} where there are some
 very similar routines, I guess TBL's are a bit better though. Especially
 Appendix underwater scene has a problem with the perspective. Also the
 phong dolphin that quietly passes in front of you next is a copy (more or
 less) of TBL's superdemo. Anyway, the music is back, and so are the
 tunnels. Again they're transparent, both of them, this time their colors
 changes when passing each other. Like the rest of the demo it's made in
 truecolor, looks quite nice on this routine, but if they haven't mentioned
 it I wouldn't have noticed. And as mentioned above I don't like the choice
 of colors too much. The credits are shown in font of this routine. A nice
 moving bumpmap is presented next, unfortunately the movement isn't smooth,
 I guess that just a matter of processor power. The music changes to a
 mixture of techno, a bit of hiphop and similar stuff, the effect is a
 transparent phong object and a pulsating background, very nice. A text
 constantly loops in front of these routines and all you have to do now is
 to quit the demo.

Conclusion: Not a must see, not bad either

Inside information:
 - Informer's computer crashed in the end of May, Flapjack borrowed him his
 hardware so that they could get the demo finished for IO4. That's also why
 the demo wasn't intended to be released at that party.
 - The demo was coded on an unexpanded A1200.

+ Let's get the nuclear weapons out of the world!
- Ugly and noisy

Comment: This is not a demo, not a normal demo anyway. It's more like a
 slideshow on speed. A lot of medieval pictures and some a bit more modern
 is shown fast after each other in different colors. The screen flashes
 regularly (actually all the time) except for the last part of the demo
 where the hardcore slows down and a real routine actually is on, a simple
 one, though: A plasma which waves a picture on the Y-axis. Wow!... It all
 ends with a text screen, and if you actually read this text screen (or
 this text) you'll find out that the "demo" and the crew behind it is
 against nuclear weapons - aren't we all. It's nice that they want to do
 something about it, but I seriously doubt that this is the right way to
 broadcast the message...

Conclusion: The show is ugly and the message is more or less lost in the
 noise. Forget it!

+ One nice "routine" and a funny animation
- Made with Navigator Titler Pro and Stone has even taken demo slides from
  Navigator Titler Pro and included in their own "demo"...

Comment: The first thing I thought about when I watched this "demo" was:
 "I've seen that before! It's Navigator Titler Pro!". NTP is a program that
 make 3D titles realtime. Stone has obviously used NTP for creating their
 "demo" which contain lots of not too smooth 3D texts flying around, and a
 cute animation where two simple persons is beating up each other. In fact
 it's some of the most realistic movement I've seen in a demo-animation,
 but it's drawn with the talent of a child. It's quite funny. While the
 techno keeps playing one text after another are shown with typical NTP
 backgrounds. And Stone has even taken demo slides directly from NTP and
 put in their own production! That really sucks! When the "demo" reach the
 end it starts from the beginning.
 I wonder if this is all an animation?

Conclusion: The "battle"-animation is worth having a look at, forget the
 rest.

+ About everything is in this demo is great!
- Minor complaints about a few routines, nothing particular

Comment: This demo is a classic! It's great! Almost everything is perfect,
 code, graphic and music, everything... Well, enough praise for now. It
 begins with a rotating galaxy, in front of this the credits are faded and
 shown. The music is very atmospherical, but it changes to some well made
 demo-music when the next routine is on: A voxel landscape, it's fast, it's
 blue and the resolution is (too?) low. After that a bouncing ball made of
 rings spins around in front of a fancy background, it's replaced by some
 gouraud objects (which is almost smooth on my machine). The background
 breaks into two and you're blinded by a bright light coming from the
 crevice! Wauw! A simple rotating ball with spotlights on the sides casts
 it's light around and (again) we're blinded (this is one of my
 favourites). Next routine is something called shade clusters. It's some
 kind of rotating pixels growing in one end and disappears in the other.
 Then it's time for some motion blur. A picture representing a face is
 being twisted and blurred. The resolution is very low, but it looks great
 anyway!
 Suddenly the style of the demo changes completely. In flatshaded 3D-scene
 we follow a simple lamp jumping up the stairs and down on a table.
 Andromeda calls it `Natural motion', and I agree. If I ever saw a lamp
 jump around for real I'm sure it would look like that! It really is
 natural motion! The music in this part is an epic, atmospheric tune,
 which fits perfectly.
 Then the style changes back to the "old" style with another ball, this
 time with a texture on it. You can see the pattern from the background
 as shadows on the ball, yet it is not transparent. This effect is very
 smooth and fast! Another one of my favourites is the next routine, the
 plasma zoomer. As the name vaguely suggests it's a zooming plasma
 constantly changing its colors. It's pretty fast and very nice.
 Last effect is a raytraced scroller (that's what they call it anyway).
 It's a 3D scroller that sends "... fuckings to Lord Helmet of
 Spaceballs...". Hmm, I'd like to know what has happened here (with juicy
 details!), anyone knows?
 The pictures in the demo are "soft", friendly for the eye, and fits well
 into the atmosphere. The music is (as indicated earlier) great, and it's
 timed perfectly too. Some say that it is too monotone, though. There's a
 reason why this demo is still in the top end of all demo charts!
 A last thing I have to mention is that unlike most nowadays demos this
 one only uses one single disc - less than 1Meg! Amazing!

Conclusion: A classic! Watch it now!

Inside information: The title Nexus 7 could refer to the film Blade Runner
 (from 1982, directed by Ridley Scott, starring among others Harrison Ford,
 Rutger Hauer (my favourite actor!) and Sean Young). Some of the replicants
 (artificial humans with superior power) in this movie are named generation
 Nexus 6 - Andromeda could have called their demo Nexus 7 to indicate that
 their demo is superior to other demos, just like the Nexus 6's are
 superior to humans.

+ Nice design, timed music
- Short demo with a way too long end scene

Comment: A blurred polka logo is in a flash transformed into the intro
 picture and the demo has begun. The credits is shown with some pulsating
 vector letters flying around on the screen, cute. A cube like thing with
 rotating pictures on the sides is next. It moves and spins quite fast,
 and is smooth as long as it's not to close to the viewer seen from certain
 angles. Then there's a bumpmapped cube, not especially smooth, but
 acceptable. The techno like music is timed well to the demo. In the last
 part of the demo, which is some kind of 3D landscape, the music changes
 to a good piece of newage. The 3D scene is not the normal vector scenes
 and the like, actually I don't know what it is, but it's slow, and if
 you're not close to the objects in it they disappear. Furthermore it lasts
 too long, after a moment you're bored. If the routine was faster and the
 resolution better this could have been nice I guess. But it isn't...

Comment: This is kind of a wannabe MTV-style demo with sick colors and
 fast changes (the music is much better than most of that on MTV though!
 It's a "quiet" piece of hardcore). Unfortunately they (don't) succeed. The
 routines are about as ugly as a lot of the MTV-crap between the
 commercials, and most of them are pretty slow and simple. Just to mention
 some of them: A kind of plasma, an extremely slow, simple and ugly tunnel
 and a pretty nice fractal routine where it looks as if the fractal melts.

+ Some nice routines, nice pictures
- Made with '060 in mind, so not all of the routines are fast

Comment: Sunshine prod. doesn't hide it: It's made with a '060 in mind,
 and therefore there are some slow routines in the demo, but also nice
 routines. It all starts with the group name in front of the groups
 initials which are on for a long time. The techno music slowly starts and
 we're off. You get a short glance on a nice but slow plasma tunnel, which
 is taken over by a big env-mapped phong object which is rather slow.
 Another phong appears, this time bumpmapped. Nice, but again a bit slow.
 Then another slow plasma tunnel is shown, same type as before. It changes
 back to the phongs, transparent with a nice background picture. Talking
 about pictures: There are quite a few pictures in between the routines,
 all of them are quite nice (and almost all of them are drawn by MRK).
 A slow bumpmap appears, the spotlight moving around on it isn't very
 smooth. The next routine is nice, but only shown for a short time. It
 can be described as a lightsourced whirlpool sucking everything around
 into the deep! After that the next one is on: Some bright small balls
 flies around, when above each other it looks as if they melts together.
 This effect is nice too. A smooth tunnel is on next, but unfortunately it
 is not shown for a very long time. Also it would have been nice if there
 was some light deep into the tunnel, so that you could see more far into
 the it. At last the plasma tunnel returns in a different version, but the
 basics are the same. The music is a little monotone especially in the end,
 that is because Mr. Coke (the coder) has made the module longer to make it
 fit the demo's length. Too bad.

- Bad picture quality, pretty boring

Comment: As the title suggests this wild (?) demo has consists of lots of
 nude persons, ladies that is (of course...). The pictures are shown so
 that every time the bassdrum sounds (it often does as it is a fast piece
 of techno) a piece of the picture is added. In front of the most vital
 part on the picture there's a little rotating vector box which disappears
 just before the picture does, then a new picture is shown in the same way.
 All of the pictures are black/white and the quality isn't that good. Later
 the pictures are shown in short flashes, and at one point in the "demo"
 something is written in French (it might be funny, but I don't have a
 clue). The demo is pretty boring I think. It's the same pictures shown
 again and again very fast after each other, and I don't really think that
 a production like this belongs to The Scene.

Conclusion: I guess it's more interesting to watch a GIF-collection...

+ Nice design, nice pictures and great small animations
- Some routines are primitive because of the age

Comment: Oldie, but goldie? Then it was gold for sure, but even today there
 are some parts that are quite impressive. And especially the design and
 transitions are nice, almost all of the routines have a way of introducing
 the next routine, instead of just using a black screen.
 The show starts with a picture of an astronaut's face, a woman by the way,
 by Mack. After a while the show start with the group name, credits and
 that kind of thing, and in between these there are some great gray-scale
 animations, one with a raytraced space craft, some where you're flying
 above mountains. Unfortunately these scenes are very short, but then again
 animations are big and would take up too much space then. After these
 introductory parts the first "real" coded effect begins. A ED-209 look-a-
 like in vector graphic is walking around (ED-209 is the hostile robot in
 Robocop, a fierce creature!), suddenly you fly into it and see that
 someone actually has to steer it. From the view of the robot we're walking
 around in a "village" consisting of gray blocks, this sequence is rather
 long. Afterwards we see the robot taking an elevator down into the Earth,
 a good excuse for a tunnel effect build of vector objects. Later a
 texture is zoomed towards the screen, and when it covers all of it a
 transparent gouraud shaded box crosses it, or rather through it as half of
 it sticks trough the background. Afterwards Gengis demonstrates how to
 build a background by showing us some boxes with part of the full texture
 on one of their sides, then putting them together. The last one of these
 is the background for the next routine, a ball with a moving picture
 wrapped around it, quite nice. The picture that is used as wrapping is
 also to see in the zoomer/rotator afterwards, also this one is nice
 despite the low resolution. It's fullscreen and fast. Finally we're down
 in the basement, a Doom routine is on. It has texture mapped walls, some
 even with an animated ventilator on. The floor and ceiling aren't mapped,
 just checked. The resolution is good (1x1), the frame rate is pretty low,
 though. It ends with a nice picture by Titan.
 The music is synth, fits the demo well.

Conclusion: Watch it because of its transitions

+ Everything is pretty nice!
- A small (insignificant) bug

Comment: If you've seen @{" Darkside " link "Darkside"} you have a very good idea of this demo's
 style and tempo, it's about the same. The routines on the other hand are
 far from the same, it's not some kind of recycled material demo, or a
 remix for that matter, it's its own. If you haven't watched @{" Darkside " link "Darkside"}
 (which you should do then) I'll tell you the it is moving at a slow pace,
 not that the routines are slow, they aren't, but the whole show takes it
 easy all the way through. The first routine, though, that one is pretty
 slow, not just in its pace. It's a phong mask with stripes across it, a
 strange effect as it isn't just painted on its surface, but rather that
 every second line is a bit displaced. The credits are really an
 experience, but still it's a simple routine. The names are shown with
 deep, transparent letters which are faded in on the middle of the screen,
 turned and then faded away, beautiful. The screen is then covered with
 some pictures with a lot of small text on them, not a chance that you can
 read it, and after a short while the picture that is on is faded into a
 flatscape routine, no black screen in between. These fades are used later
 in the demo too, and are very smooth. The flatscape is a beauty, in a good
 resolution and fast too. Shadeclusters or what looks like it is the next
 effect. It is a lot of pixels put together to a strange 3D-shape, this
 shape then slowly spins around. The more crowded a place is concerning
 pixels, the brighter the area gets. But that is nothing compared to the
 quite strange spiral/fractal/undescribeable routine which is shown
 afterwards. The display area is square and from the upper left corner to
 the lower right corner the square is split into two, one side is mirroring
 the other while the most beautiful patterns, which reminds me of fractals,
 move around. Great! The next routine is more impressive than beautiful, as
 it is a voxel landscape that is able to move any direction it likes. The
 colors are natural, that is white on the mountain tops, brown in the
 valleys. The single blocks that the whole thing consists of tend to get
 quite big when they are getting close, still it's one of the better voxels
 I've seen. Also a white line is by some reason shown in the left side of
 the screen during this routine, a little insignificant bug... A strange
 picture is shown afterwards, odd motive of a head with eyes that are
 covered with what looks like dropped white paint. A variation of the
 shadecluster routine is the next thing shown, this time not with randomly
 placed pixels, no, they form an object. It looks very pretty. The last
 routine is an extremely nice metallic 3D-tunnel (you can move freely
 around), both fast and in good resolution. TBL has really understood to
 get the right polished metal-look on this one. Wow! However, a negative
 thing about it is that it isn't darkened, meaning that you can (in theory)
 look as far into the tunnel as you want to, but the result is a failure...
 You don't look that much into infinity, fortunately, it is mostly
 concentrated on the walls. Finally there's a TBL-logo, and by clicking
 right mouse button you enter the debugger that can actually be accessed
 through the whole demo (toy for non-coders, tool for coders).
 The music fits the demo very well, it's a quiet piece of synth, but with
 its own private sound that you probably don't find anywhere else (I
 haven't found it yet!).
 Even though it's normally Equalizer and Offa (two other TBL-coders) that
 are known to create the best demos, the other coders prove that they are
 so very talented too!

Conclusion: A worthy and beautiful follower.

Comment: Starts with a pretty nice bumpmap showing the credits, which is
 taken over by a "different" phong routine (flying animated spirals), which
 is displayed using blitterscreen. Unfortunately it's not very smooth.
 Before the next routine a nice logo (graffiti style) is shown. A tunnel
 with lights running down the sides is taken over by another slow phong.
 Then some phong/bumpmap things appear (I don't know exactly what it is,
 but it looks okay, it's slow though). In the end there's a 3D-scene, it's

+ A really nice change, some nice effects
- Some 3D-scenes that needs a fast computer, few routines

Comment: The show starts with some nice pictures telling us the demo's name
 and which group that has made it. A nice plasma routine is run on the last
 of the pictures, it almost looks like water, except that it doesn't move
 like water. An average picture by Fame leeds us to the next routine, a
 nice phong object which is a little out of focus, so that it looks a bit
 blurred. There's an excellent change and suddenly we are in the middle of
 a texturemapped 3D-scene, also out of focus. Unfortunately (as you can
 read above) you'll need a quite powerful CPU to run this at a fair speed,
 without at least a '040 it's too slow. But besides from the speed (and the
 2x2 resolution) it's nice. After this processor hungry thing there's a
 good texture-bumpmap. And then we return to the 3D-scene or a much similar
 one. And another!? This time with a ball in the middle of it all.
 A big sign says "the end" while a env-mapped, transparent, blurred phong
 makes it way around the screen, and at last it disappears.
 The demo is a little short, and I don't quite understand why Floppy has
 chosen to show three 3D-scenes, two that looks (or is?) the same, and two
 right after another. But it could have been much worse...

+ Some nice effects and music
- Some routines are a bit slow

Comment: A fine demo from the legendary group of Rebels this is, including
 nice routines, strange pictures (in my opinion pretty much average
 concerning their quality), and good techno music by the two new "recruits"
 Some1 & Morrow.
 The show starts with a plasma/water effect, somehow the two effects are
 made into one with success. The credits appear in front of them, and when
 they disappear they are making waves in the water. A very nice routine. A
 flash followed by a fast zooming Rebels logo is shown for a short time
 afterwards, which again is followed by a very nice and colorful voxel
 landscape with moving lightsources (three of them they say), it's one of
 those scapes that are able to move to both sides freely. The speed could
 be better, but still it runs at an acceptable frame rate, and the light
 sources really add an extra dimension, so all in all a good effect.
 After that the title screen is shown that is taken over by a short
 animation where you're flying through a cloud. A different bumpmap is on
 next, different because of two reasons: 1) A morphing "3D"-object is
 implemented in the map (nice!) and 2) lines of code are scrolled across
 the bumpmap and is also affected by the lightsource. It runs smoothly too.
 A wave routine is on as the next effect, rather slow, but nice anyway.
 It's pretty much like watching a lake from above when you drop a stone
 (or another thing) down into it, except for the moving lightsource and the
 picture in the background. On a fast computer this effect is cool.
 The music now changes for a while from techno to synth with a flute as
 lead as the effect changes to a fog voxel landscape where the "camera"
 is able to point in any direction. The speed, music and the choice of
 colors are pretty good. After that a big picture presenting a sleeping man
 is scrolled from bottom to top of the screen, then a slow tunnel routine
 starts, too bad about the speed. Another bumpmap is on next, this one is
 in colors (dark, and not many, though) and tends to look a little like
 metal. The picture that is exposed to this routine is nice, the picture
 that are shown afterwards not that nice. The new picture is used as
 texture in a wallwrap routine afterwards, and sometimes a glass ball
 appears in the middle of it. Nice. Last routine is a 1x1 env-mapped
 (I think) phong fungus (phongus?), a pretty fast one considering the
 resolution and the background that changes from sharp to blurred now and
 then! A fine end-routine in a ditto demo!

Conclusion: The first place at Remedy '97 wasn't unfair!

+ Some nice routines
- No design, some slow and some lowres routines, you have to wait for the
  next effect sometimes

Comment: Strange. It doesn't seem as if anyone will admit that they've made
 this demo. It's not that bad, though. For example the start is very good:
 The group name's letters flies in on the screen, so that it looks like
 that they come from a place behind the "camera". The letters are texture-
 mapped and lightly blurred which looks very nice. But I'm afraid that this
 is the best effect in the whole demo. Two rotating textures are shown at
 the same time at every second line, so that the first texture has line
 1, 3, 5, etc., while the second texture has the other lines. Not that
 nice, but pretty fast. Afterwards nothing happens for a while, then the
 screen starts to flicker like a TV with no input signal. The flicker
 slowly changes into a fast, weird, texturemapped plasma/tunnel thing that
 looks like if a lot of texture is spit out one place and disappears
 another place. A lousy, blurred, texturemapped box starts moving in front
 of it and even through it. It isn't smooth, but quite acceptable, besides
 from the blur and the texture it looks nice. After that there's a pretty
 fast "Decent"-routine (like Doom, except that you can move on all three
 axis). The price Tulou has paid for the speed is the resolution which is
 low. The routine after that is a similar routine, but by some reason it's
 extremely slow. Maybe because that this one is fullscreen and the other
 wasn't, but that shouldn't slow that much. Another slow routine, and
 unoriginal, is a texturemapped torus. The "plasma" routine afterwards is
 a bit slow, but acceptable. Actually it's more like a tunnel. From the
 middle of the screen a lot of colors appear and move towards the edge of
 the screen so that it looks a little like a tunnel. The last routine is
 some kind of fast wallwrap, where some of the texture is close to you and
 some of it is far away from you. The resolution is a little low, but not
 low enough to be irritating. The music is a techno piece with a touch of
 synth.

Conclusion: I guess all routines have been seen better before (maybe except
 for the letters in the start), judge for yourself

+ Nice design, Funny little startup-menu, some nice effects, the heads...
- Some slow effects (but acceptable), needs some CPU power

Comment: When you double-click the big icon a menu appears, where you have
 to choose which machine you have, and whether you want to start the demo
 or see the Elk anim (which is very amusing!). Well, sooner or later you'll
 probably start the demo, which begins with (except for the average intro
 picture) some kind of vector landscape. The vector's edges are blurred, so
 it actually looks quite nice, there's a small bug in it though, and it's
 slow. The music is the kind with fast drums and a jazzy sound. Furthermore
 someone is singing. A different piece of music, but fits nicely into the
 demo. Two faces sometimes have a little conversation when running the
 routines. Then there's a phong, which is a little slow, and then it's time
 for the doom-routine, one of the better compared to lots of others. The
 textures are nice, but it is a little slow. The doom-routine stops (but is
 still there), and some @{" Phongs " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Passengers1.GIF"} flies around in it and disappears around the
 corner (nice idea!). Then the "camera" goes through a door and ends in the
 middle of a new routine: A cube from the inside, with the 3le logo on the
 sides and one of the phongs in the middle. Very nice indeed! Then we have
 a tunnel in the blitterscreen, but it doesn't matter that much. The colors
 are fancy and the tunnel is fast. Also when a phong star flies through its
 walls! Some of the last effects are the phong torus (square), the duck
 (slow) and a morph-routine where Father Elk (Nude) is made more pretty (?).
 It's not as good as the one in @{" Bosnisk Metall " link "BosniskMetall"}, but still it's
 okay. Recommended not just because of the nice routines, but also because
 of the different design and the talking intellectual (?) heads...

Conclusion: Watch this one! It's both beautiful and amusing!

+ Very nice routines
- Short

Comment: Just by reading the title you might think about dull phong
 objects, but actually there's not a single one in this very short demo.
 Almost all of the routines are nice, for example the show starts with
 (a pretty nice 3D start picture with the letters CRAZE and then) a
 phunky plasma/twist routine where the name of the demo is in the middle.
 Looks really great! It is made so that it in the beginning is completely
 bright (white and yellow), and then it's getting darker and darker.
 Then there's another plasma routine which is nice too, but the resolution
 is rather low. Then there's a very nice bumpmap, which is in a rather
 high resolution which makes it look a lot more realistic than the lowres
 ones. The routine changes to a transparent torus which looks great too.
 It's pretty fast too, but only the middle of the screen is used. A
 "party twister" is the next effect (looks like a bar being twisted), but
 by some reason it doesn't run smooth. It isn't a slow routine, but
 sometimes it just stops for a little while and then continues. Too bad
 'course it looks nice. The really weird thing is that the two twisters
 in the end of the demo run almost perfectly. Just to mention the effect
 that I haven't mentioned yet: Two different textures is scrolled and
 twisted around eachother, running at every second line, so that it looks a
 little like that they are transparent. Fake, but fine...
 The music is an okay piece of techno, a little "dreaming" tune.
 Unfortunetaly this demo is (as I mentioned before) rather short, and
 that's a shame. If the design was better and the demo longer it would
 probably be able to compete with the "big ones"! It's Phunky!

Conclusion: A must see! Should have been longer.

+ Nice pictures, some nice routines
- Strange design, small routines, no quit

Comment: This demo is somewhat different from most other demos, as it is
 a combination of an auto-cycling slideshow and a demo, rather than being
 a demo only. But that isn't necessarely a bad thing, not when the pictures
 are as good as in this production! Also the music is pretty good, in the
 beginning it's a short atmospheric orchestral piece, and during the demo
 a mixture of pop and some jungle/trance. As mentioned there's a lot of
 pictures in this production compared to its length, all drawn by Lowlife,
 that's what they say, but lot's of those small pictures that are used as
 texture maps are by Boris Vallejo.
 It starts with a loader picture, then the credits are on wrapped into some
 nice design (though, there's a little bug in it, I guess that's if you run
 it on a '030 or above, should't appear on '020). A beautiful title picture
 is on afterwards, must be a combination of traced and hand drawn graphic,
 maybe even scanned!? A texture mapped partytwister is on next, not just a
 traditonal square one, it has about eight sides. It's fast and nice.
 Another nice picture is shown, then a tunnel with some lights flying
 trough it, probably an animation. It's on for a short time and is then
 taken over by another picture, this one with a little texture mapped ball
 that moves around on its surface. Four pieces of metal sometimes cover
 the ball and when they move away there's another texture on. Would be nice
 if it was bigger. Next on is another texture mapped object, a small three
 sided pyramid. The exciting about this is that it morphs into a ball, nice
 and surprising (not after reading this! :))! Finally a picture presenting
 a puma is on and then the endscroller written with a hand drawn font,
 sometimes a bit unreadable.

Conclusion: The pictures make this demo view-able

+ Nice party twister
- Short, few routines, one very slow one too

Comment: This is a dentro they say, and that's why it is so short. But it
 doesn't explain why the routines are so simple or slow. There's only one
 nice routine in this production: A party twister (a bar is twisted) with
 lava colors. And it's smooth. The other "main"-effect is an extremely slow
 wave-thing with a texturemap on it. The music is techno, average.

+ Different, colorful design
- Lots of color cycling makes the demo look "cheap"

Comment: A strange, different and very colorful demo, where the palette
 cycling function is the most used effect... The show start with a life
 simulator, you know, these small strange things where small blocks
 representing life move around, etc. These blocks finally forms the
 Melon.-logo which shortly after starts to go in (lightsourced) pieces.
 After that some big low-res scans of woman's faces are moced around a bit,
 maybe rotated, I have some problems defining what exactly going on, or
 actually there's not much going on... From now on the demo gets really
 colorful with cycling backgrounds behind many of the routines: A box that
 crashes into the glass on your screen (if you aren't using a projector...)
 and is formed after it (cool), a transparent Melon.-logo, and also a
 jelly logo is shown. In between all these routines different fancy
 pictures/scans are shown, most of them with vulgar texts on them...
 And Melon. has even broken one of the Scene's unwritten rules, the one
 with nude pictures, by showing a raster image of a woman's body with their
 logo running up and down on it, it forms after the body. On the other hand
 I'm glad it's not a man they chose :). The demo is one of those fast
 moving ones that wants to be funny and cool, but in my opinion Melon.
 fails in both. I guess I'm a minority, though...
 The music is techno, the kind leaning to the dance genre, easily heard,
 easily forgotten.

Conclusion: If you like crazy demos that concentrates on being different
 rather than being beautiful.

+ Nice plasma, transparent routines look great
- Ends suddenly, sometimes the resolution is very low

Comment: This demo contains lots of plasma, so if you like that (which I
 do) this is certainly worth a try, and even if you don't: watch it!
 Different kinds of (mostly nice) plasma effects is spread through this
 production (including a lightsourced one), but besides plasma you'll also
 find a transparent "party twister" (looks like a bar being twisted), which
 is quite fast but in a very low resolution, and some transparent tunnels.
 Everything is shown at a very high speed, but fortunately most effects are
 shown more than once, sometimes with a little variation. All effects have
 a nice background texture (very appropriate for the transparent
 effects...).
 The music is a good piece of techno with some heavy riffs in it, the
 textures and the logo are fine, and the fullscreen graphic is above
 average.

Conclusion: Definately worth having a look at.

+ Probably looks nice on a FAST machine, pretty good music
- Slow routines, few effects (they ran out of time)

Comment: Before I start watching a demo I often read the Readme-file, if
 there is a such. And it is the most terrifying things that you can read in
 these files sometimes! This demo's readme-file says something like: "We
 ran out of time". And that's why the demo contains only few routines which
 isn't very fast. The first one looks a little like a broken torus where
 the pieces are placed a couple of inches from their original places. Nice,
 but a little slow. The same routine is then exposed to a blur effect,
 where it is flushed towards the viewer, while a little copy of the screen
 appears in the upper right corner, so that if you're able to look two
 places at a time you can see the demo on one big and on one little
 screen :-). This is slow! Then there's a phong object (slow), a bumpmapped
 object (very slow) and a rings in water effect (very slow). Furthermore
 when changing to the last effect from the water effect something goes
 completely wrong with the colors. But it disappears when the last routine
 starts: A texturemapped alternative face. And then you can quit the demo
 when you don't wanna see on the face any longer. The demo creators ran out
 of time... When you click you go back to Shell or WB and shortly after an
 ugly and buggy bumpmap with credits on it is shown. It zooms a little in
 and out, and the letters are a different color than the background. But
 I guess they should have waited with this release.
 I wonder why so many people are involved in this production. Too many
 cooks spoil the broth?
 If I should say something positive about this demo it must be the techno
 music, which is pretty straight forward and pretty good.

Conclusion: Forget it. Too bad that some release unfinished work when it is
 such a lousy quality. It could have been good, but it isn't.

+ Very colorful, smooth effects
- Rather primitive effects, it's just a commercial

Comment: Yes, it's quite right I guess: Commodore made a demo demonstrating
 the A1200's capabilities. Or rather, they made someone make it for them
 (I guess no one at Commodore knows how to programme the Amiga, not after
 the original team left or was "hidden away", anyway).
 The demo contains different effects like simple shaded vector objects,
 glenz vectors, a texture map where the lower part is close to the viewer
 while the upper part is far away from the viewer, a jelly pyramid with the
 C= logo on, and a very colorful picture (I like it!) of a chip with Amiga
 boing balls jumping in front of it). In between some of these effects the
 A1200 standard datas is written (for example 4 x faster than A500!). A
 spinning C= logo is always present on the screen in the lower right corner
 so that you won't forget what this is all about. When it's over it loops.
 The music is synth piece, a piece with no spirit what so ever, so it fits
 the show very well... There's some minor bugs in the sound if you run it
 on machines faster than '020.

+ Some interesting routines, pretty good music
- Most routines are a little slow

Comment: If you've seen some of PSB's other demos you'll know that they're
 different from most other demos around. But this one is somewhere between
 the normal demos and PSB's. Some of the first thing I noticed was the
 background pictures and the good techno music. And instead of making the
 demo as ugly as possible (which PSB normally does :-)) with lousy drawings
 and music most of it actually looks OK, it still got the usual PSB touch,
 though. The first routine is a phong bottle, which is followed by an env-
 mapped phong bottle shortly after. Then there's a scanned picture (about
 all pictures are scanned and added a little text), and when it disappears
 the traditional phong duck is on, the eyes look a little different from
 the original, though. Like the bottle this one is also shown as an env-
 mapped version. next routine is somehow cool: A wireframe schoolroom with
 a texture as background, it might be precalced, but it's nice. The last
 routine is (tadahh!): A phong. Not a bottle, not a duck, but a blank beer
 can. And of course this is also shown as env-mapped...

Conclusion: Friendlier for the eye than the usual PSB-demos, but maybe not
 so amusing (?)

+ This is so great! Even though it's designed for '060 it's good on a fast
  '030! Some good music, nice design
- Some parts are a bit slow (with '030)

Comment: Wow!!! This is so cool! After a five years brake the British Scene
 seems to have awaken from their sleep! Not with a silent "good morning",
 no, with a roaring "GOOD MORNING WORLD!!!". They sure have returned with
 probably the best demo since @{" Tint " link "Tint"}, however you can't really compare those
 two demos as this demo has a quite different style. Would be like
 comparing a comedy with an action-movie. Well, enough idolization, let's
 have a look at the demo itself:
 Small bits of the Nerve Axis appear on after one, and shortly after it's
 written across the screen. Suddenly some @{" wild explosions " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Pulse.GIF"} start in the
 background, great except for the sound which sounds to much like drums
 instead of explosion, but that's doesn't matter, and you probably won't
 notice the first time you watch the demo (and trust me: You will watch it
 more than once!). The music starts, one of those things with a lot of
 trip-hop drums in it, fits the demo okay, and the title is shown with
 a lensflare effect that changing its colors running in the background,
 pretty nice. Different kind of plasma is shown afterwards, all of them
 nice and smooth, and you'll probably notice that they run in wide-screen.
 The last of the shown plasmas which mostly looks like a cloudy sky is
 stretched so that it fills the entire screen (also causing lower
 resolution), and soap bubbles start flying from the bottom to the top of
 the screen. Meanwhile the plasma transforms into some kind of tunnel,
 brilliant! Suddenly the picture freezes, then it's zoomed away from the
 viewer revealing another tunnel behind it that in a way reminds me of the
 marvelous lightning tunnels in @{" Tint " link "Tint"}, except that the lightnings aren't
 on the tunnel's sides, it's between the tunnel's sides. Great! While this
 effect is running a great picture is zoomed and rotated from somewhere in
 the tunnel towards the screen, ending up covering the whole screen. It's
 a hi-res picture representing a fish. Glub! After a while the picture
 disappears and the next effect starts. It's some kind of flatscape with
 both floor and ceiling with stripes of light making its way away from the
 screen. Furthermore it starts to wave up and down, and if you put your
 head close enough to the screen you really get a rush :)! It's fast, but
 it would be nice if they've used more colors. And then for the part of the
 demo that is the main reason for buying an '060: A underwater 3D-scene.
 It's pretty slow on an '030 (too slow to be nice), but great on an '060 I
 guess! It's a very atmospheric scene where you're are slowly moving around
 something that looks like a wreckage of an old ship, but it's a bit
 difficult to see it, because of the dark blue colors (which isn't meant in
 a negative way at all, it's part of the atmosphere). That's probably why
 the sub-marine that is also present has turned on its spotlight! I sure
 would like to see this on one of those fast Amigas! Also the music for
 this part is good, except for the drums that is still on. The next effect
 is some kind of metallic bumpmap, I'm not sure if it is actually a real
 bumpmap, but it looks as if it is and it's nice too, so who cares?!
 At this point the music changes to a more catchy tune, a good one too!
 A fast scrolling from-top-to-bottom background appears and shortly after
 some kind of phong object appears in front of it, looks a bit like a
 chain, except that it's massive, there are no holes on it. And by the way:
 Normally chains don't start to boil. This one does! Small excrescenses
 starts appearing on the surface causing the still spinning "chain" to
 grow bigger and bigger! Great! Also the next routine is really worth
 having a look at. At first it looks like a silent lake with a mountain in
 the background. The surface starts waving a bit, but it's when a little
 boat appears the water really starts to move. The boat cruises around in a
 circle a couple of times, the waves rise around it! Two "minor" routines
 appear afterwards, a smoke effect that spells the demo's name, then
 explodes, and a blurred ball with moving lightsource causing the entire
 screen to be filled with colors, both pretty nice. What appears to be a
 waving plasma is shown as the next routine, pretty nice. Suddenly it
 starts to zoom away from screen, then it stops, splits up into small
 squares which flip over so that you see the face which is on the
 backside. Then they are put back together and zoomed back to fill screen
 again. Then a lighteffect is then run on the newly created face. The
 effects themselves are good, but combined like this they really make the
 difference! Next routine is original too, even though it's a bumpmap. The
 great thing about it is that it waves up and down or else it changes
 between two different bumpmaps so that it looks as if it is there are
 waves on it, in a way simple, but as you might know it's aften the simple
 things that are the most beautiful!? Still nothing (?) beats the final
 effect, a 3D-scene where you are flying above some hills or mountains.
 Nerve Axis really has hidden the best part to make the demo end with a big
 bang! Actually it's so great I almost have to turn my Amiga around to see
 if anybody had replaced my '030 with a PPC604e and a 3D gfx-board :-)! You
 are flying around above these texturemapped hills, above the see too, and
 a better water routine has probably never been seen in a 3D-scene before,
 ever! So realistic it is! And that's not all (characteristic for the
 demo!): Small glass balls appear, mirroring the landscape beneath them
 while flying around in a circle. Afterwards they are also seen in free
 flight with circular smoke tails behind them. Also the silhoutte of a
 couple of birds are seen! The whole thing runs in widescreen and a low but
 quite acceptable resolution. And that's about it! Boing, boing, boing.
 Crunsh. The British Scene is reborn - and Nerve Axis just did it!

Conclusion: Don't leave home without it! One of the best demos made in
 1997!

 show. The nicest part is the credits part, some phong letters are in some
 way morphed from nothing into the letters. The rest of the effects are not
 too wild, either they are simple and buggy (some morphing gouraud objects)

 rings in water-routine and a phong head). The graphic is a little above

Comment: Warning! This demo is boring! Both because of it's very long
 compared to the number of routines, and because of the slow fades
 between the routines. The first routine too is long: A fireplace where
 the fire forms some text. It's actually pretty nice, but it's a little
 little (the fire) and, as mentioned, rather long. Then there's a quite
 nice spiral/plasma-like thing or something like that. In between some of
 the routines are some cool cartoon/graffiti style pictures, which maybe
 don't fit the demo extremely well, but matches the rock/funky/hiphop music
 (with some lyrics). Also to mention is the slow phong (in a normal
 resolution) and the pretty fast envmapped phong, running in a low
 resolution. The endtune is a nice trancing newage piece with some drums.

+ Very nice start-animation, some nice pictures
- Lacks some design, many of the routines are old-fashioned, the music

Comment: The show starts with some very nice logos by Syl presenting the
 demo. And what happens next are at least as nice: An underwater animation
 where you are following some lights entering a tunnel and their
 flight/swim through the tunnel. It's both smooth and fast, and the
 resolution is quite acceptable too. The music is suddenly cut off after
 the title is presented, and for a short while it seems as if it hangs
 (which it does if you don't make a clean boot or have a lot of RAM), but
 a pretty noisy techno module starts playing, while the demo continues with
 different kind of cubes, one with strange surfaces and also it morphs.
 Next up is a transparent plasma, looks pretty good. After a while an
 average picture by Deckard is shown (average compared to his usual work).
 And when it disappears nothing happened, which (hopefully!) is an error in
 my copy. Anyway, shortly after a new picture appears and the demo
 continues with a blurred vector object, not that nice, and the low-res
 plasma afterwards isn't nice either, mostly because of the resolution.
 However, the shadecluster routine afterwards is pretty nice, the really
 nice thing about it is that it is mirrored in a "stick" beside it. A new
 Deckard picture is on, this time a real beauty (both concerning motive and
 quality!). The same picture is used in some kind of plasma routine
 afterwards. Getting nearer to the end there's a routine with some
 lightsources flying around, melting together when they get close enough to
 each other. The end-scrolltext is cool, not so much the scroller it self
 (actually it's pretty "jumpy"), but the color zoomer in the background is
 cool.

Conclusion: Worth having a look at, especially the animation!

 that want to be fire, still it's pretty nice. A tunnel on next, actually
 I think it's just a picture of a tunnel which is rotated while the colors
 are cycled so that it looks as if you're flying down the drain. In front
 of the tunnel is some kind of shadecluster moving around. Another phong is
 on next, this time a blurred one, and after that a plasma routine, which
 looks okay. The display changes to blitterscreen and stays this way the
 rest of the demo which is a shame. Furthermore it seems as if the routines
 are generally getting slower in this last part of the demo, despite the
 blitterscreen. A bit strange, as the routines don't look so much more
 advanced than in the first part. Anyway, the phong blob is back ones
 again, and again it's a bit different than it was before, now it changes
 it color! Recycling is good to a certain limit, but... Next effect is
 somehow recycling to, but it has been changed enough to be called a new
 effect. It's a plasma that ill-treats a picture in different ways. Except
 for the blitterscreen (and maybe the colors) this is quite nice. And guess
 what, the blob is back. No, actually it's not exactly the same blob,
 'cause this one's surface is parted into small polygons while the whole
 object looks a bit metallic. Still it's nothing exceptional, only okay.
 Suddenly the music is cut off, and we're entering the demos last part.
 A new piece of music, still the same Mantronix/Lizardking-style, is on,
 and so is a not too smooth scroll text. Actually it's a big picture with
 a lot of greetings on it that are scrolled over the screen. The funky
 thing about this is the glass-torus flying in front of the scroller, very
 need! Next on is a fast fractal zoomer, but unfortunately it's not very
 clear which I think a fractal should be... Getting closer to the end it
 seems as if the routines are getting slower and slower, for example an
 env-mapped jet and to phong objects. Even if they were fast I doubt that
 it would improve them much, because they aren't too pretty. Finally the
 endscroller appears, and when it's over the demo exits and the music is
 cut off again without fade...

Conclusion: Worth having a look at

+ Nice and colorful
- Few effects, very CPU hungry!

Comment: As the title suggests this is a quick little production, and made
 using Peskanov's 3D-engine which is design for a game. He is very ashamed!
 Anyway, it's a quite nice engine, especially the HAM-modes are impressive,
 while the speed is (in the demo) slow. But then again, it's made for '040
 and '060, and running in both HAM-6 and HAM-8, 1x1 and 1x2 resolution.
 The show starts with a Capsule logo that spins around dragging a long tail
 that doesn't disappear after it, while the colors seem to cycle. Total
 acid! Also the title is shown the same way. And from now on it's all 3D-
 scenes of different kinds. The first one present a praying man beneath a
 column with a cube with the magic word C64 on its sides. Next one takes
 place in the universe, near a space station. The most exiting thing about
 are the cubes with a galaxy (that is also used as background picture) on
 their sides spinning around. We are flying towards a picture which shows
 to be the next scene, a nice transition.  This scene is the slowest of
 them all, but the object, an env-mapped galleon, is probably the reason
 for this. Last one is a torus 3D-scene where a lot of big torusses are
 lined up and the last one of them are flying through the others' holes,
 and then it all starts all over again while the "camera" watches it from
 different angles. Nice colors, processor hungry routines.
 The music is techno, not much to say about it.

Conclusion: Recommended for people with fast processors

+ One of the most atmospheric demos ever, nice music (timed) and graphic,
  nice routines!
- Some of the 3D objects are a bit small (but then again: They are fast)

Comment: Ever read the cartoon Judge Dredd or seen the film? If yes, you
 can easily imagine the start of this demo: It's a little cinematic
 sequence where a team of soldiers is attacked by an ABC-robot. The colors
 in the sequence, and in most of rest the demo, are different shades of
 red, which helps making it very future-like and atmospheric. The credits
 in the beginning are also very cinematic, they are shown with the
 "Terminator 2"-effect and the sound effects fit perfectly.
 Then the "normal" routines start: An envmapped "party twister", nice (but
 a little small) jelly gouraud objects which fly through a transparent
 square, a "blob map" (they call it), a jelly 3D envmapped object, and one
 of my favourites: Wall wrap, a texture is bend so that it looks like 3D,
 while it moves around (reminds me of plasma). In between some of those
 effects quotations from famous sci-fi writers are shown, or a very nice
 picture is shown. After a bouncing ball with a moving picture wrapped
 around there's a nice water/plasma effect (rings in the water). The
 colors are red, blue and yellow and it all looks great! In this part the
 heavy/hardcore music changes to a more quiet style. The last parts of
 the demo looks a little as if Rage ran out of ideas (it's some more or
 less simple pictures), but it's not that bad at all.
 The endpart with a "different" scroller, and a blurred scroller is nice
 too, and so is the atmospheric, quiet techno music that is played.
 The 14th place at TP5 is a mystery to me. But then again, it's seen (too)
 many times that it's not the best demo that wins...

Conclusion: Atmospheric! Especially recommended for Sci-Fi fans.

+ Extremely nice design, fast (but primitive) routines
- Some low-res routines

Comment: Wow! I must say that I'm very impressed! This demo has some of the
 best design I've ever seen! Even Andromeda and TBL have (had) some very
 serious competition here! There are only very few cut changes, and the
 ones which are aren't disturbing in any way. Also the choice of colors and
 so on are very nice. Right from the start it looks great: Some hi-res
 animated 3D gear wheels are shown while decrunching. A little text below
 saying "AGA disabled" tells us that they don't like AGA (or maybe it's
 just a note from the guys who patched it?). The demo's name is shown very
 elegantly among other things with a very nice pixel sprayer writing the
 name, and afterwards the pixels are changed to a drawn sign. The screen
 falls down and behind is a low-res voxel routine with a simple vector
 plane flying above it. As this routine ends the plane flies right past
 the viewer with a fitting sound. Then about eight or ten 2D balls in
 different colors fly around in formation, and they're also rotating on
 the Z-axis. Then it's time for a VERY low-res rotator routine, the
 resolution is just good enough for you to see what's being rotated.
 Afterwards there's a very nice pixel box, then a blurred box which is
 filled with water, so that it becomes massive. On two of its sides there's
 suddenly some kind of waving copperlists. Another pixel effect, this time
 a flag with the TEK logo on it, is on. Then there's the classic "vector
 box with a mirror flying around it"-routine, pretty nice, but what is even
 nicer is that the mirror is morphed into the letters TEK. Another pretty
 classic routine is the glass ball in front of a text, so that the text is
 bend in the ball. Another rotator is on afterwards, actually there are two
 of them, transparent that is. The resolution is as low as before, but
 still it looks OK. Then for another very nice pixel effect, a bunch of
 pixels are morphed into different objects, and finally we've reach the end
 with a scroller saying something like: "Aga? Just say no!". These guys
 don't like AGA by some reason! The music is traditional demo music with
 sound effects now and then timed perfectly to the effects. Not that good.

Conclusion: Great design! I'll recommend this demo both because it's good,
 and because it's inspiring for nowadays demo creators!

 in all there's 12 pictures of sceners, all black/white, and all with a

+ Very nice design, nice graphic and logo, pretty good music, some nice
  routines
- Some simple routines that aren't smooth

Comment: Nice design, music and graphic and generally nice code. It all
 starts with a fairly simple 3D starfield where the nice logo is shown.
 It starts to rotate and is suddenly changed into a chain of stone-like
 things that move with same speed and rotations as the stars. Beautiful!
 This routine is made darker except for a square which suddenly changes
 to a rotating cube with the routine on some of its sides! That's design!
 Then another fancy change leads us to different kind of simple 3D objects
 (Env mapped, gouraud and envmapped phong). You can see the age of the
 demo, especially in this part and in the next. It's nice, but old...
 A little 3D scene starts: A futuristic 3D envmapped plane flies around
 above a simple vector construction. When seen from certain angles it
 starts to move uneven. After a 3D tunnel (you're flying through envmapped
 hexagonal rings) another simple 3D scene appears, this time you're flying
 around in what looks like a moonbase. It's smooth as long as it doesn't
 move too fast. But it sometimes does. The background is beautiful, though.
 The last routine is also a "flying over 3D-scene", this time there's a
 texture on the vectors: Mountains that appear way to close to the
 "camera", and the routine is generally much to slow to be nice (you'll
 probably need a very powerful processor).

Conclusion: A mixture of very nice routines and some old fashioned ones.
 Have a look!

- Alternative display (the question is: is this a negative thing?)

Comment: The show starts with some 3D pictures showing the title and group
 that is scrolled across the screen vertically. And after these pictures
 one of the strangest ways of displaying things I've seen is used, and the
 colors help it look even more strange. I won't try to explain it, but say
 that it's acid! And a bit small. The things displayed are a torus (!), a
 juggler, the same torus as before with RGB lightsources, the juggler from
 before also with RGB lightsources (actually it's his juggler balls...).
 The display changes into a normal display and a texture vector object is
 on, it's a little slow, very slow when it's near the viewer. Another slow
 routine are some transparent and blurred letters spinning around. The
 credits/greetings-part is original: It's a book opening, and on every page
 are the names. Unfortunately it's very small and therefore difficult to
 read. Finally there's a doom-routine using the acid-display and it doesn't
 look too good. When it's all over a 3D picture saying ESCOM AMIGA is shown.
 Any publicity is good publicity??? The music sounds like something from a
 ten years old platform-game (that's not good :-)).

+ Some nice routines, nice backgrounds, good music
- Some routines are not smooth

Comment: It all starts with a not too smooth rotating plasma while the
 group and titles are shown. The phong torus afterwards isn't too smooth
 either. However, the resolution for both of the mentioned routines is
 good. So it is for the next routine: shaded nice 3D objects flying through
 each other. Time for another torus, an env-mapped one, which is on for too
 long. It's quite nice. After that  (I think it's) a gouraud-shaded box
 with half a shining ball on two of its sides. Strange... The next one is
 slow: The Core name as 3D object, blurred and also gouraud-shaded, but
 slow. The next routine looks mostly like zooming Christmas trees
 disappearing when they get close to the viewer. Strange but nice. A plasma
 much like the one in the start is on, the credits are shown in front of it.
 In the end a bumpmapped Core logo without bumpmapped background is shown.
 Instead there's a rotating spotlight shown which points in the direction
 of the viewer, but it doesn't look that realistic. On the other hand it's
 far from being ugly. The music is a nice synth piece.

+ Once it was good
- It isn't any more...

Comment: An old classic. Old enough to be out-dated. The routines are
 primitive, the music is mostly noisy and the graphic is old-fashioned and
 of course only few colors are used as it was made for chipsets before
 AGA. It's split up into several parts, each of these parts contain about
 one or two routines. In between the different parts a picture of a smoking
 cyborg dressed in cowboy clothes is shown, and above him is a scrolltext
 (that I can't read because the decrunching is to fast on '030). For each
 part there's a new piece of primitive demo music.
 I will not mention all routines, but here are some: A scrolltext with a
 copper list in it, a cute, short and funny worm animation, a small picture
 that rotates around the Y-axis, a vector scrolltext that makes a circle
 and transforming vector balls, etc.
 My copy contains a lot of bugs and therefore several of the routines look
 completely wrong, and at last it crashes completely, but even if it does I
 don't think that the last parts would improve the demo much (?).
 Funny how taste changes - yesterday this demo was hot. Today it's not...

Conclusion: For the old sceners who miss the good old days.

 In the beginning a voice growls some words which are written on the

 very funny. There's a lot of growling in the heavy metal (noise made with
 voice), and most of the music are samples put together in a module. near

 A fire effect, the display looks quite strange and it's a bit boring. A
 routine that draws colors on the screen, slowly, and this routine is shown
 for a very long time. Yawn. Last one is a texturemapped cube that rotates
 around the X-axis, while it moves towards and away from you. Nothing
 special. Then there's the end-scroller, yes, it's over.

Comment: It starts out with two rotating plasmas running at every second
 line of the screen in a low resolution, so that one rotater has a line,
 then the next rotator has a line, etc., while the credits are shown.
 Looks nice. Then there's some 3D-pyramids with a picture on the sides.
 This routine is quite fast, but not very smooth when the objects are seen
 from certain angles. Later in the demo there's some normal (slow) 3D-
 objects (gouraud I guess) and some nice transparent 3D-objects
 (env-mapped), Especially one of the last 3D-routines is great: A
 Transparent star-like object rotates in front of an animation showing some
 rotating cones/spears. The resolution is (again) low, though.
 The graphics are quite nice, the music is a very good piece of techno.

Conclusion: Single routines make this demo worth watching, not to forget
 the music.

Comment: "Scoopex - Generations ahead"? Well, I'm not sure that is
 completely true, if it was Scoopex would have made demos as they are today
 then. But they didn't, and this is a good example of that. It consists of
 about four different effects: A sinus-scroller shown between the main-
 routines, which gets more and more unreadable the more it's shown (at last
 it's sinus'ed at both the X- and Y-axis. A starfield that is on almost
 through the entire demo. A vector balls effect and a plane vector effect.
 Not impressive compared to today's standard, but I guess it was then.
 However, a positive thing is that it's all smooth.
 The music by Uncle Tom is a bright point, though (if you like the good old
 classic Amiga synth style and sound). Also the few logos shown is pretty
 nice.

+ Nice routines (3D scenes, 3D objects, bumpmap...), excellent graphic
- A little monotonous with all the 3D

Comment: 3D. Lots of 3D. 3D objects, 3D-scenes and bumpmap is the main
 contents of this very nice demo. The graphic is very nice (especially the
 intro picture by Made, which was placed 2nd in the graphic compo at same
 party (and I tell you that the graphic compo at that party was
 marvelous))! The routine rolls: In front of a 3D starfield a lot of small
 vector pieces is formed into a phong human! You're flying around in a fast
 3D scene, very nice (but I guess you'll need at least a fast '030 to make
 it run smoothly). Again we meet the 3D human flying through the universe.
 It flies away and the greetings are presented on a big "wheel" with signs
 on it (we're still in the same 3D-scene)! Then let's have some 3D objects,
 there are different kinds (including a piece of chocolate lying on its
 tinfoil wrapping!), and after that credits shown in a very nice bumpmap
 routine, with a lightsource in different colors. Smooth too. Before
 reaching the end, there's another 3D-scene, this time with two mirrors
 in front of eachother, so that the scene is shown lots of times when
 looking in the mirror. Some of the best 3D-scenes ever are in this demo!
 The dreamy music with the deep bass and the fast drums fits the demo
 pretty good (I don't like that kind of music, though) and is timed to
 the routines. At last there's the letter 'B', it's rotating and it's
 lightsourced (the 'B' is the Bomb logo).
 Competed with @{" Makaveli " link "Makaveli"} by Essence which was no. 2, but Shaft 7 got
 about twice as many points. That wasn't completely fair in my opinion, but
 that's the way it is...

Conclusion: Great 3D scenes! One of the best productions in 1996!

Inside information: Shaft no. 7 was a picture drawn by H. R. Giger in 1966
 (the man behind the monsters in the Alien(s)-movies). He wanted to express
 some weird dreams he had had.
 Maybe it's unintended that the demo's name is almost the same, but I doubt
 it...

 no. 7 picture on Amiga)

+ Amazing transitions, good routines and music
- Only few routines

Comment: This demo really has some really great and floating transitions,
 and the routines are fast almost all the way. Actually there are only few
 routines, but one of these is made so great and is so variated that that
 doesn't matter at all! The routine I'm talking about is basically a good
 3D tunnel, but the wild thing about it is that it is so very flexible, it
 changes into anything (well, something...) and that is with some of the
 most floating transitions imaginable. I'll start from the beginning of the
 demo, though, just to do it the chronological way.
 Some sounds are heard, and everytime that happen you can see a short flash
 of something. There's a big blast and the demo has begun. A big voxel like
 object, not landscape, are spinning around in front of you while the
 techno that at this point is close to breakbeat hardcore (whatever that
 is!) is heard. A big blob it is in front you, quite fast, not beautiful,
 but rather interesting anyway. A poem (from the film Blue Velvet by David
 Lynch) are written on the screen according to the bassdrum, afterwards the
 credits. The object disappears and the title is written with big funky
 letters filling the whole screen. Now the great transitions start (hang
 on!): Behind the title a background picture is shown, it shows up to be
 a tunnel texture, the second after we're flying through this tunnel,
 looking around on its wall and making 180° turns. Then the tunnel which is
 circular in shape changes to a "flower-shape", then back to being
 circular, and a twirl routine is suddenly started causing the tunnel to
 be... Well, twirled, but just for a moment, shortly after it's stretched
 and pressed together, soon afterwards the shape changes to a triangle
 where the bottom of the tunnel is moved away, and the two sides that are
 left are turned, so that they now are a floor and a ceiling instead of
 being the walls of a tunnel! In a little flash the textures are changed
 a bit, which in a way is a shame, but maybe Frame wanted it to be as
 variated as possible? After a flight over the flatscape that appeared the
 ceiling slowly fades away, and the remaining floor is transformed to a
 voxel landscape with small hills and what a voxel landscape is build of!
 Finally this voxel landscape shows to be the surface of a big lightsourced
 party twister, you're simply zooming away from the landscape and discover
 that all of it was this big bumpy twisted bar. Phew! An extremely good
 example of maximum design combinated with good code, and good atmospheric
 techno for that matter. If I should say something negative about this
 effect is it that you can't see too long down into the tunnel, it is
 getting dark not long from the viewer, but that's not essential for the
 effect. The last routine is a blob si,ilar to the one in the beginning of
 the demo, the colors are blue and green, before they we're mostly brown,
 the resolution is better, and therefore it's rather slow, too bad, but
 still nice. Furthermore this blob morphs to other shapes as it crosses the
 screen. Then the demo ends. If this demo has had more routines it could
 have made it to the top!

Conclusion: Great! The transitions are what I've dreamed about for a long
 time!

+ Few nice routines
- Few routines, low resolution, a bit buggy

Comment: An unfinished demo Cirion says, but anyway they have chosen to
 release at the Assembly, and I think that's a mistake. The demo has an
 unfinished look, and is a bit buggy. Furthermore almost all of the
 routines, which isn't many, runs in a low resolution, and even when Cirion
 has tried to hide this fact with colorful background textures they
 somehow fail. The show starts with a space-scene where the credits are
 shown too. The stars seen are big square dots and there's no planets in
 range. A sun nearby causes lensflares to appear. We are also told that
 the show runs in 18 bit truecolor, but I can't really see that. A nicely
 traced Cirion logo is on for a short period of time, then it changes back
 to the space-scene where a spacecraft suddenly appears with the word
 "presents" written on its left side (what a coincidence that it fits into
 the demo :)). Finally the title appears. The first "down to Earth"-effect
 is a colorful phong object, texture mapped, with some kind of cylinders
 sticking out of it. It's on for a little too long, and it doesn't help
 to put on a new background and a new object on afterwards, it's quite
 uninteresting in the long run. The second object is env-mapped though.
 And by some reason the first thing that happens when it's on, is that it
 leaves the screen, just to pop up somewhere else on the screen a couple
 of seconds later!? A picture that looks a bit artificial is shown before
 the last low-res phong is on: A big twisted ring, nice object, but still
 rather boring. The nice routine in this production is on the other more
 nice than the average nice things: It's a plate with a picture on it. This
 picture is twirled and exposed to different kind of abuse (plasma), while
 the plate itself slowly flips a couple of degress in each direction so
 that it looks a bit like that the face is trying to get out (but still it
 is not a 3D-effect of that kind). Afterwards the demo ends with a scroll
 text. The music is some silent house/techno with newage sounds included,
 not too good in my opinion.

Conclusion: Find another one to watch, this one ain't worth it

+ Funny story...
- ... That tends to be a little too monotone, ugly graphic and sound

Comment: This demo is made in eight days (the code), while the music and
 graphic is made in respectively four and five days Spaceballs say. And
 I'm convinced. They've haven't tried to make a technically brilliant demo
 (near impossible in so little time), instead they've tried to make a
 funny story, and I think that they partly succeed. Only partly. The demo
 is the story about the Smurphs, those cute, little, blue guys living in
 Smurph Land, dancing Smurph dance and so on... Spaceballs version of
 Smurphs is that they are still very naïve and innocent in mind (the
 primitive drawings look that way), but they both drink and smoke grass!
 If Peyo was alive he would turn in his grave! Spaceballs don't seem to
 stop here. They give one of the Smurphs a gouraud shaded pill which has
 quite an influence on the poor guy. He starts to see blurred scenes with
 other smurphs and poisonous fungus, strange colors, weird shapes and
 psychodelic texture plasma effects of several kinds.
 The music changes between a little happy tune when watching the smurph
 and a piece of techno when Spaceballs is up to something. Also a synth-
 tune is included. The graphic looks as if it was taken out of a book for
 children, primitive, and the Smurphs are "out of shape".
 The demo is in a way funny, but tends to be monotone, it's too long
 compared to what's going on.

Conclusion: If you need a good, slow laugh this is it!

+ Different bumpmap routine, one nice picture
- Almost everything else

Comment: It starts with some ugly pictures, the demo's name and the
 credits. After that the effects start (if you could call them that...): A
 Completely black 3D-object with a primitive lamp or something twisting
 around it. The only reason why you can see the 3D-object is because of
 a bad background picture. Generally there are a lot of ugly pictures
 spread through the demo. On one of these pictures there's a quite boring
 twirl routine which doesn't even move. The next twirl routine does move,
 and it is even a nice picture that is used, but it's slow and constantly
 switches from the twirl routine to a screen with some text, then back
 again. Precalculated... The last routine is different and pretty nice.
 And quite unexplainable, but if you imagine looking at some cells through
 a microscope you'll have a pretty good idea. It's some kind of animated
 bumpmap. The music is techno, OK.

Conclusion: The usual PSB I'm afraid. That's not good...

+ Atmospheric music
- Monotone, ugly, boring, not a demo

Comment: This is one of the weirdest productions I've ever seen. It's can
 hardly be called a demo, as the only thing that happens is that a lot of
 low-res WB-screens (converted from hi-res which gives a strange messed-up
 look) is shown while an atmospheric quiet tune is played. Besides the WB-
 screens also screens from different programs are shown. It's very boring
 to look at, and you can't quit it, so you have to either reset or wait for
 it to end. If you choose the first solution you will not be able to read
 the credits - but who cares (and if you really wanna know who made this
 crap I've already taken care of that, but by some reason I don't think
 that it's the real names. Read inside information below).

Conclusion: Crap.

+ Some nice routines, good funky music
- Slow 3D (and boring: It's a torus...), some primitive routines

Comment: This demo makes me think of some of the good old demos, with its
 simple but beautiful pixel routines and the simple and nice plasma. But it
 also contains some of "modern" routines like phong (including env-mapped)
 and... Hmm, that's about it. Well, the phong (which is a torus) is slow
 anyway... But probably very nice on a very fast machine...
 One of the pixel effects is a lightsourced pixel cube that rotates, and at
 the same time some fractal-like drawings are drawn. You can see that the
 cube is slown down when the fractals is drawn, but it looks nice anyway.
 In the end there's a 3D picture and the music changes from a nice piece of
 funk to a mixture of techno and rock. No endscroll text, no credits...? Is
 there an error in my copy?

Conclusion: Simple, but have a look.

 demo where you instead of nice standard effects are presented to an MTV-
 style demo with silhouettes of dancing girls and other people in action
 while the colors flash and change constantly! Everything runs very fast
 and smooth, and also the music, a wild piece of techno (not hardcore) is
 high quality and fits the demo well. From the second you insert the disk
 in the floppy drive or start it from harddrive the show is on, instantly!
 And what a show!

+ Some nice routines, excellent music
- Some slow routines (especially the phong) - needs much CPU power

Comment: Starts with a phong head with 2 faces (I mean "real" faces...),
 which is very slow (1x1). Then there's a pretty slow rotating tunnel of
 some kind, and I begin to worry if this production needs a hell of CPU
 power!? But most of the routines after this run acceptable or even fast!
 One of the impressive effects is a fullscreen 3D bee that moves a little
 around (not too much, so I suspect it to be a little pre-calced). The
 resolution is a little low. Guille might have seen a PeeCee demo with a
 bee?... Later there's a lot of pretty smooth slow moving plasma of
 different kinds, a fast tunnel (also plasma) which is nice, but a little
 buggy, as it doesn't always cover the entire screen. All this is
 accompanied by a good piece of techno, and in the last parts there's an
 even better piece! A picture and some textures are "wall wrapped", looks
 as if the picture is bend into the screen while it moves around. Cool.
 At last we have another very slow phong, moving around behind a
 transparent Syndrome logo.

Conclusion: Recommended! Especially for you techno freaks out there!

+ Nice code, original
- Blitterscreen, short, needs an assign, exit on joystick button

Comment: A rather different demo in some ways, almost innovative,
 especially concerning the effects and the quality of these effects.
 The first thing that happens when you start it is (if you've remembered
 to assign it...) that something that could be defined as a ring of smoke
 or light, but that's just while warming up. The demos speed suddenly
 increases a lot and we're flying through a nice tunnel that actually
 looks pretty much like a real tunnel, and shortly after a television is
 standing in front of us telling us the demos title. Everything is in
 blue colors that together with the nice scenery and the noisy techno
 music makes the right atmosphere. Unfortunately the whole thing is shown
 using blitterscreen, but actually that isn't a disaster as it seems to
 fit the show, still normal display is always to prefer. Next effects
 is a ball with a moving surface and some beams coming out of it, still
 in blue colors and blitterscreen, still fast and nice! A ball is also
 to be seen in the next little scene, actaully many balls, which fly
 through some rings that reminds me a bit of gearwheels. It's blurred a
 bit and that makes it look even better. The next little scene consists
 of a floor and some small balls that fly around in a circle above it.
 Suddenly they fall down and are smashed on the floor, all the fragments
 are jumping nicely around, and we are in a hurry changing to a picture.
 Another picture is shown right afterwards and this one is exposed to a
 strange flip effect. Imagine that the picture is split up into several
 small square pieces and each of these pieces are flipping and turning
 around synchronized to each other. Looks a bit odd, but it is a very
 interesting effect. Afterwards there's a short flower scene, a 3D-scene
 including a big red flower and a spiky object flying beneath it, but it
 has to be seen to understand it. After a picture and a plasma effect you
 are to dive down into the blue sea to watch a shoal of jellyfish. This
 scene needs a little more processor power than the '030 is able to
 deliver, even when it runs in blitterscreen, but still it's nice. The
 last effect consists of an animation with a spinning head in the
 background and a round 3D-object in the foreground with nozzles that spits
 out small pixels, looks cool. The head reminds me of the scene in the
 movie Blade Runner where Deckard and Bryant watches the replicants, just
 to give you an idea...
 If you are to compare this one with its predecessor you will find only few
 similarities. The speed is a bit faster in Sumea I think, while Faktory is
 much more colorful, but it hasn't Sumea's magnificient effects. The only
 things I recognize are the TV and the ball with beams coming out of it,
 both of them are very different from Faktory.

Conclusion: A different demo that is higly recommended!

+ Nice start-animation, good music, great unreadable logos, fast routines
- Most of it is different kinds of plasmas, tends to be boring in the long
  run

Comment: The Anadune logo is shown, then a screen with a lot of wise words
 is shown for a long time. Finally the show starts, not with a coded
 effect, but with first part of a nice animation where a man walks towards
 a city, while the music helps creating the right atmosphere. Some credits
 are shown, then a bit more of the animation, the more credits, etc.
 A cool unreadable logo tells us the demo's title (?). Finally the number
 made effects start, starting with a very nice changing plasma with a
 couple of small texturemapped cubes that rotates on the X-axis in front of
 it. It's fast too. Next routine is a big circular texture with a spotlight
 slowly moving around on its surface. Another plasma is on afterwards,
 strange colors I'd say, but it could be design... A pretty good picture by
 Kazik is shown after the plasma routine (Amiga rulez! is of course (?)
 included), and a new plasma takes over. This time a texture plasma, making
 an eye waves up and down, but that's only the start, because shortly after
 a big glass ball enters the screen and fly in front of the eye, causing it
 to be refracted in it. Nice. At this point the resolution is 2x1, but
 Anadune obviously wants to make a 1x1 version, so that's what they do
 next. By showing the same effect next to each other... And they call it
 design. After one of Lazur's great pictures more plasma is shown (starts
 to get pretty monotone with all that plasma), disguised as a tunnel that
 changes it colors, the quality is still very good. A good picture by
 Kazik is on as the last thing in the main-part, the good synth-music
 and the picture fades out, and the endscroller appears (and I guess I've
 never seen a scroller with so many errors in it!).

Conclusion: An evocative demo that is recommended, especially for plasma
 freaks!

Comment: Two things make this demo worth viewing: The design and the
 pictures. The changes from one effect to another are good, or else one of
 the great pictures are shown. I must admit that Flow is one of my favourite
 artists, with his "different from most other Scene artists"-style, a
 little naiv and simple, still thoughtful and beautiful (I made that up
 myself...). These pictures aren't his usual style, though, it's still
 different, but this time it looks completely like real painted paintings.
 It even looks scanned, except for the extremely high technical quality.
 The music is a pretty quiet piece of techno with a bit of guitar in it.
 The effects are transparent gourraud, a phong using few colors, some nice
 and some not too nice plasma and some rings moving around on eachother
 (cannot be described, but looks nice).

Conclusion: Worth watching!

+ Cute, innovative, different
- Short, only few routines

Comment: This demo is different from the masses. Instead of techno music
 Silicon uses circus music, instead of using low-res they use hi-res
 blitterscreen (it looks that way, anyway) and instead of trying to be
 hotshots they have chosen to let the characters in the demo dress in
 rabbit suits and the like! Everything in the demo are well drawn, the
 music is good to (if you like that kind of music). The first routine is a
 man jumping in front of a rotating background with a lot of text on it.
 The rotation is not to smooth, but it looks nice anyway (the hi-res helps
 a lot as you're almost unable to see that it is blitterscreen - or maybe
 it's just my shitty monitor?). After that there's a fast tunnel routine
 with a texture that looks like a clown or something. Nice too. And then
 the bumpmap: A colorful spiral is illuminated from a lightsource outside
 the edge of the picture. Also nice (this demo is nice!). The next routine
 is also a kind of bumpmap, but without bumps!?... I think it's a picture
 which is split into several small squares, each square catches the light
 independently from the other squares so that two squares besides each
 other almost does the same, but not completely because of the different
 directions the light comes from (you probably didn't understand anything
 of the past few lines, I understand that, but watch it - it looks great!).
 Another tunnel is on, this time a mirrored one changing its speed
 constantly. The last routine is a band twisting and winding all over the
 screen and in is a scrolltext. It's difficult to read, it's quite slow,
 but nice anyway. Only *** to this demo? Yes, it should have been longer.

Conclusion: Watch it! Despite its short duration (or maybe because of)
 it's good and very original.

 First of all the traced pictures that presents and ends the demo is of
 a high quality, secondly the animations of the dancing and playing persons
 are good, and third: The backgrounds are beautiful color cycling plasma,
 while the persons also are mapped with plasma in different colors. The
 title must refer to the many symbols that are zoomed towards you between
 the people-animations, mostly totally inunderstandable.
 However, I wonder how come that one of the persons is playing the guitar,
 there surely are no guitar in the laid-back Techno/synth-piece. The
 quality of the music is okay, though.
 It ends with a star field showing the credits, then a scroll text.

Comment: Just to clear things up: This demo has nothing to do with the
 group Syndrome, Balance choose the name without any reason (or a "it
 had to have a name"-reason). It's their third demo, and definately not the
 best. Still, all routines are fast, the design good and the demo-music
 very well timed (but changes so often that you can't really follow it).
 Unfortunately the routines are mostly pretty simple, for example the
 various 3D objects, flat shaded, glenz, one that partly disappears through
 the background and one two-colored and shaded one too. Other routines to
 be found in the demo is really beautiful plasma with a fast partytwister
 in front of it, a Lotus-effect where you are driving on a road, you can't
 see any cars, trees or signs, though, a glass ball in front of a picture,
 causing the picture to be magnified in it, a primitive flame effect and
 a "magic crystal ball", one of those glass balls with electricity coming
 from a thing in the center of the ball. But it's a failure as it doesn't
 really look like electricity at all. Nice try, though.
 The pictures that are in the demo are of average quality, non of them are
 better than okay.
 The demo ends with an scrolltext!

+ Nice design, fast routines
- No quit, the end is a bit monotone

Comment: The first thing I noticed when watching the demo is the high speed
 at which the routines are shown. Only few last for more than six or seven
 seconds. The second thing was the little vector digital watch which is
 present from start to end, it's a countdown to the demo's end. Sometimes
 it makes its way across the screen, but most of the time it's placed in a
 corner. The first "real" effects are different kinds of tunnels consisting
 of blurred lines. Nice. The demo's and group's name are shown with big
 vector letters flying around and morphing. There's a lot of vector and
 line routines in the demo, just to mention some: Rotating line grid,
 vector flatscape with a light sourced box "walking" around on it, vector
 morph, a vector man kicking a box, a box which changes between checked
 sides and wireframe, and more. Furthermore there are some pixel effects
 (jumping balls), a shade bob routine writing some exciting text ("Amiga
 rules"), and a few not too impressive pictures. Everything is put together
 in a pretty good design and with very nice changes. The music is a kind
 of "break-beat" techno, a quick little tune which fits the demo well, and
 furthermore it's perfectly timed. And that could be the reason why the end
 of the demo is a bit too long, it has to fit with the countdown.

Conclusion: Recommended. Especially for demo creators because of the
            design.

+ Original, nice code
- Is a bit monotone in the long run

Comment: An audiovisual experiment they state in the readme-file, and that
 is actually a rather precise word for the demo, mostly concerning the
 visual part, as the music is an okay piece of techno, atmospheric when it
 has to be, but never really reaches a higher goal. As the title suggests
 the demo is based on TV, or more exact: What is on the TV-screen. A lot of
 different recordings from TV mixed with some of Bizzare Art's own
 recordings are digitized and put into the computer. It is shown with one
 colorshade at a time, sometimes brown/yellow, sometimes green/blue, in a
 good frame rate, but the resolution is a bit low. But film has been seen
 before in a demo, nothing new here, the interesting part about it all is
 how the video recordings are combined with the old well-known routines.
 The first one is a square texture mapped torus that flies in front of the
 movie, which has been converted to a two color display when the effects
 are on. Also the classic mask is in the demo. Other interesting routines
 are a lot of small boxes with a little movie on each of their sides,
 a zoom/rotator routine, also with a film on it and so on. The last one is
 a torus seen from the inside, of course with movies on its walls.
 In the credits part we see the three bizzare persons who've made the demo,
 of course in a video recording. The whole demo runs at a high speed, with
 lots of fast changes helping creating the right "TV-atmosphere".

Conclusion: Recommended!

+ Good and fast routines, pretty nice graphic
- Lack of design

Comment: Some people say that this demo should have won the compo it
 competed in, but as you can see it "only" got the 3th place. But one thing
 is for sure: It's a nice production, especially the routines are fast. And
 this is even on the '030-version (which also works on '020), it must be
 extremely smooth on faster processors!
 The first routine is a texturemapped police car (thug means bandit, which
 explains it). It's rather simple and square, but fast and nice. After that
 a very special kind of bumpmap is shown. It looks like some kind of
 gasoline colored tin foil with letters printed in it. Great! There are
 three "ordinary" 3D-scenes in the demo, which look like each other pretty
 much. They are fast, a bit boring to look at and two of them contain
 lethal machinery (tanks and killer robots like ED-209 from the film
 Robocop). In between the scenes are different routines: A very fast phong
 object in good resolution, and a plasma tunnel which looks a little buggy
 because that half of it is mixed colors, the other half just one color.
 The tunnel also starts to twirl which looks very nice. After that the
 great bumpmap is back, but this time they've wrapped it around 3D-object
 (a blob) and it looks very realistic in a way! A picture is shown (called
 "Denis" drawn by Norm, and was no. 2 at the same party). Another, but
 different, 3D-scene is on: Small hovering "islands", some of them are
 connected with ladders and on some of them are houses, trees or swimming
 pools. The routine is a little buggy, but that's nothing to talk about, so
 I won't. Another fast phong is shown afterwards, and then an original
 greet-part: Yet another 3D-scene, this time with cartoonish planets with
 sign on them saying a group's name. Or else it's written on the rings
 surrounding some of the planets... It's both fast and beautiful, the
 planets seem to be a little square, though, but actually I think it helps
 them getting the right cartoonish look. And believe or not, but the next
 routine is (you guessed it!) a 3D-scene! It's a room with gray walls and
 a gear wheel in the middle with Essence written all over it. A nice detail
 is a text in the upper left corner saying: "PC SUXX" (hehe, they've got a
 point there!). After a picture a pretty weird end-text is scrolled across
 the screen, coming from the top moving towards the bottom.
 The music is a mixture of techno, demo-music and hiphop, fits the demo OK.

Conclusion: Very nice, have a look! Should have won the party!

+ Almost everything!
- A few slow routines, the music stops before the end scroller

Comment: No wonder that this demo is in the top of all charts: It's one of
 the greatest demos (if not THE greatest demo) ever made on ANY platform!!!
 There are so many great effects that I've lost count! Only a (very) few
 routines are a bit too slow for my A1230, but what the hell: It runs on
 '060 too...
 It all starts with some bouncing letters on a funky background, the music
 in this part is a nice piece of funky rock. Then we're flying through a
 nice tunnel. Then there's a nice @{" voxel " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/TINT2.GIF"} with some kind of lightsource.
 You're flying over the ocean with small hills sticking out of the water.
 The sky looks very nice too, not just a black screen in the top, but a
 nicely drawn texture. While this voxel runs, a 3D tunnel flies from the
 top of the screen and then you're flying in the texturemapped tunnel!
 On the walls the credits are shown while the tunnel spins around! Suddenly
 it stops and fades to a transparent lightsourced phong-object. Nice!
 A weird bumpmap with moving lightsource is the next routine. It splits
 into two, and behind is yet another bumpmap which also parts and so on,
 until we end up with a background picture and a bumpmap cube with
 different textures on the sides. It flies away and out of the background
 comes a texturemapped lightsourced zooming rubberball! A matching sound is
 heard. It bounces around until the background is transformed into a very
 cool tunnel with lightning on the sides!!! Wow! Later there's a env-phong
 beer can being crushed. It disappears and the middle of the background
 starts to wave (a little like a water routine). A very nice bumbmapped
 @{" fish " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/TINT4.GIF"} swims in front of the waving background! Lightsourced of course.
 In between some all these effects some very nice pictures are shown.
 Then there's an effect where a @{" face " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/TINT3.GIF"} is morphed out of a block and back
 again (phong) while the background is a flat 3D-scape with some colors
 on it. This routine is slow, but probably runs fine on a '060...
 Another landscape, this time it's a texturemapped vector with some kind of
 fog-effect, is shown and flown above. A brilliant picture by Louie is
 twisted and blurred, but by some reason this effect is dark, too dark.
 One of my favourites is an oval transparent lightsourced phong that morphs
 into three small balls, while the background picture is moved around
 (and of course you can see it through the phong)! After that a row of
 lenses move in front of the picture and a "TV3" effect is run at the same
 time (the picture is out of focus except for the logo in the middle)!
 Gosh! More phong: A hand with the TBL logo on it, and then there's another
 one of my favourites: @{" Tunnel with lightning on the sides " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/TINT1.GIF"} (yes, one's
 already shown, but this one is different). It looks fantastic!
 Finally we have the endscroller which is not a normal endscroller, but one
 with snapshots from the demo and credits for every single routine.
 Unfortunately the excellent module (with some singing by Jennie Oberg)
 ends a little too early, so about the last minute or two of this long demo
 is silent.  But as long it's "just" the endscroller it doesn't matter that
 much.

Conclusion: If you should have missed it I like this demo! Maybe the best
 demo ever!? Amiga and TBL kick ass!

Note: The demo runs in 18 bit true-color, Equalizer coded the special C2P.

Inside information:
 - They slowly started to work on the demo after The Party 5, and from then
   and till the release they worked harder and harder.
 - Equalizer had to sneak out at night to code the demo because of his
   girlfriend! (Source: ShowTime 3, interview with Offa)
 - After the demo was shown at the party Team 17 (the U.K. software house)
   contacted Rodney, Louie and Equalizer to make them show more of their
   work. Afterwards they were signed up!
 - The Tint logo in the demo drawn by Facet was intended to be shown in
   Low-res and scroll across the screen, instead it was shown in low-res
   lace so that it fitted the screen.
 - Three days before The Gathering Offa had a HD crash, all his code was on
   this HD. Fortunately he had a backup on another HD.

+ They are somehow right concerning the statements in the demo...
- Slow routines, ugly design

Comment: These guys really know how to make a demo. Anyway, they give us
 13 "good" pieces of advice about how to make a winner demo. These are
 shown in between the slow routines (phongs, plasma, bumpmap (the bumpmap
 is fast, but lowres) and a tunnel with "mountains" coming out of its
 sides. The demo is a request to other demo groups about making original
 demos instead of just copying old routines, add some fancy music (with
 singing women) and so on. The music is by the way one of these techno-pop
 pieces with a typical pop-vocal...
 Irony on a higher level.

Conclusion: Makes you think?

+ Nice routines and pictures
- A bit short, lacks transitions

Comment: A demo with some high quality routines, atmospheric music and
 good pictures. Unfortunately it seems to lack transistions, and the
 colors are quite boring, mostly brown. The first routine is a very nice
 (and brown) voxel landscape, one of those that are able to freely rotate
 in any direction. The next one is some kind of texture water routine, I
 think it's an eye that is used as texture. A (brown) 3D-tunnel is on next,
 it's both smooth and fast, but has an ugly bug: When you look into the
 hallways, away from the sides, it flickers and looks generally strange.
 This could have been avoided by inserting a lightsource or something
 similar, but they didn't... After the tunnel a nice picture is shown,
 which is followed by another kind of tunnel, this one a texture plasma
 one, which is almost a wallwrap routine, but still it tends to look more
 like a tunnel than a real wallwrap. Another fine picture is shown, and
 we have reached the last effect, a 3D-scene that consists of some texture
 mapped columns flying around in space (or a big black room). Some fake
 lightsources are placed around the columns, fake because they are just
 drawings of flares, not the real thing. Still it's worth having a look at.
 The group's name and the demo's title are shown as the last thing, better
 late than never...

Conclusion: It's short, but the quality is quite good.

+ Some nice routines, good pictures
- The routines are a bit slow, could need some polishing here and there

Comment: This demo is created with the '060 in mind, therefore some of the
 routines are of course rather slow on slower machines, but there are also
 some that actually runs at an acceptable speed on a '030, some even good.
 The first (rather slow) routine is a smoke effect where 1000 of very
 blurred pixels slowly fly around forming what looks like smoke, the more
 pixels that are in the area, the brighter the area gets. The group's name
 are formed from the smoke. The credits are on next, and if it wasn't for
 the lightsource, a ball, that flew above the letters and the colorful
 background you'd believe that the letters were placed directly on the
 background, but as the ball flies around above the letters you can see the
 shadows hit the texture. Nice and fast! The next part of the demo is the
 money part. A lot of nicely texture mapped money bills are dropped from
 above and now fall down like paper does. In the background a picture of a
 woman with the text "They had style" below it, referring to the old men on
 the bills?! Next on is a nice phong object that glints when hit by the
 light. The resolutio is good, but the speed bad, but I'm sure that it's
 nice on a '060... And still it's not completely hopeless on a '030. A
 flash which shows to come from a little lightball leads us to the next
 routine, a strange one too. I guess it's just two plasma-look-a-likes that
 are moving around on two different layers without actaully being real
 plasma. And of course there's also a tunnel, a texture mapped one, but
 with stars flying through, a tunnel-starfield! Suddenly a space craft
 enters the tunnel, turn on its warp engines (or what ever kind of engines
 it uses) and has soon after disappeared in the tunnel. Afterwards a grey-
 scale water routine is shown with a Mystic-logo under the water, it's
 pretty even though it doesn't look like real water, and both resolution
 and speed is fine. A nice picture by Lazur is shown (has that man ever
 made pictures that weren't nice?!), the dance music (a remix of a "hit")
 is sort of cut of, it is faded, but not fast enough, as the next piece of
 sound, a techno module, with fragments of hardcore in it, is played.
 Also the next routine is grey-scale with a good resolution, but here the
 '060 is really needed. The background consists of a slow moving bumpmap
 where you can see that it is put together in each side of the map, and in
 front of this flies a phong wine glass, which crossing the screen in a
 hurry, just to make room for a pretty slow, colored voxel landscape moving
 in one direction only. After that a big texture mapped spiral-object
 appears, then a variation of the smoke routine in the start of the demo is
 shown, and a picture, also by Lazur, presenting the wild sea with tall
 waves are shown afterwards. This picture is exposed to an "old window"
 effect, where some parts of the picture are displaced a bit, just like
 looking through a not completely plain piece of glass. And the choice of
 picture couldn't be better as it makes the waves look alive. Simple, but
 effective! The smoke routine returns in a new variation afterwards, seems
 as if they are really happy about this one! Then a phong mystic logo is
 shown in a colorful texture mapped room, needs lots of CPU power to run
 smoothly, and so does the stand-alone logo that is shown as the last
 thing in this demo.

Conclusion: Recommended, especially for people with fast processors!

+ Some very nice bumpmap
- This demo is Beta and therefore has a lack of design and isn't very
  optimized. Read on for details.

Comment and information: This demo could probably have been very nice. But
 it isn't. Because of a fatal error on a hard drive all source code was
 deleted, so the demo that was released is only a beta-version. A final
 version will never be released. Because it is only a beta-version the
 routines aren't optimized (one of them a little buggy), the rock music
 restarts in the middle of the demo (it is well timed untill then) and
 there's no design. The demo starts with a very nice bumpmap routine, which
 is shaken in time with the music. The next routine is interactive, you get
 the chance to steer around in an ugly textured voxel world. The screen
 isn't very big and the resolution is low. And furthermore you're only
 aware of that you have to steer for yourself by reading the README-file
 included with the demo. When shown at TP6 the organisers found out very
 late that they had to steer the routine themselves causing a gray square
 in the middle of the screen and nothing else... The README-file also
 contains information on the routines, the HD error, etc.
 Well, next on is a texture mapped, bouncing, zooming ball which is
 replaced by another texture ball, this time transparent. Again the
 resolution is low (but it doesn't matter that much in this case as the
 colors are rather blurred). The next routine, on the other hand, is in
 1x1 resolution. It's a rayfraction 3D object (transparent of course...),
 which means that when the light hit it, it is both reflected and goes
 right through the object. It is very slow, maybe The Twins should have
 chosen to keep the lowres display. Next up is a different lightsourced
 phong duck and a cup, then a slow env-mapped 3D object. A nice picture is
 shown for a long time, and then a voxel cave appears, which is a little
 buggy (sometimes the top just disappears). It would have been nice if it
 was a little faster... At last (in my copy) there's some very nice
 bumpmapped 3D objects, both ordinary and envmapped. And then it ends,
 which is an error in my version (I guess). According to the README-file
 there are a few more routines. How this demo ended 4th at TP6 I can't really
 figure out.

Conclusion: Could have been nice...

+ Generally nice routines, the music is okay too
- It's a bit short

Comment: This is a nice little production! It all starts with some odd
 fades, where you only see some faint shadows, then an Abyss logo appears.
 A title picture is shown afterwards, it's some very well drawn letters
 spelling the demos name. The picture zooms away and suddenly it flips over
 to reveal it's other side, which is zoomed towards the screen and used as
 background for the next routine, some kind of bumpmapped @{" party-twister " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Vertigo_1.GIF"}.
 But it isn't an ordinary twister, first of all it's horizontal, and second
 it looks as if it's made with the same technique as voxel - a voxel
 twister? Very nice, almost smooth too. Next routine is okay too, it's a
 "creative" @{" phong object " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Vertigo_4.GIF"} (a ball with two peaks sticking out of it), but the
 phong that comes afterwards is much nicer, as it is env-mapped and has
 small satellites around it. And now for something completely different,
 one of the @{" coolest effects " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Vertigo_2.GIF"} I've ever seen! And I'm sorry to say that it is
 about as unexplainable as it is beautiful, but, anyway, it's something
 about some plates getting smaller and smaller that are rotated, the first
 one is rotated a bit before the next and so on. Creates a spiral effect.
 Back on the ground, a phong object takes over, not completely smooth, but
 okay. It's just so meaningless after that great "spiral" routine! The next
 routine is great too, it's some kind of @{" wallwrap " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Vertigo_3.GIF"}, but instead of just
 being attached to the sides of the screen, this one is attached to the
 sides of the screen and wrapped around a ball in the center!
 In between some of the effects nice pictures with text are shown to inform
 the viewer about the next routine.
 The music is rock, technically well made, and the music itself is okay
 too. It fits the demo okay, but I guess more electronic music would be
 better.

Conclusion: Should be in your collection!

Inside information:
 Was designed to fit on one DD-floppy, Abyss wanted it to be easy to spread
 and not take up to much HD-space.
 Abyss wanted to include more stuff in the demo, but as time went by they
 decided to release the demo without adding the stuff. Therefore it is kind
 of short.
 People at the party didn't understand why the demo was only placed 6th, it
 is said to be the absolute best demo at that party. It got three times

 seen a karokee-show you'll have a pretty good picture what this dentro
 looks like: While the Depth team is singing (in Danish) the text appears
 on the screen. The music is the only thing that keeps up this production,
 but it's quite funny when you understand it... The reason why the rating

+ Some nice routines, good music
- Some primitive vector 3D scenes and objects, the resolution is a bit low

Comment: It all starts with a nice @{" Oxygene " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Vision1.GIF"} logo while the demo decrunches.
 After a little while the show starts with the credits which are shown with
 some pretty nice plasmas in the background. The @{" title " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Vision3.GIF"} title is shown, looks like
 they've used to few colors. Afterwards the show changes to some kind of 3D
 scene: Two ugly vector toruses change their sizes so that they can fly
 through each other's holes. In the background there's a starfield, but all
 in all this doesn't look too good. The next effect on the other hand is
 great: A (probably precalced or an animation) big phong object runs in the
 background, while another phong object flies in front of it. Next to this
 phong object a vector star appears and is mirrored in the frontmost phong
 object. Time for some Wipeout-clon, unfortunately it is still standard
 vector graphic, that is no textures, no shadeings, no nothing... It's quite
 fast, though, and so is the next routine, a nice plasma tunnel which stops
 after a while, so that it becomes background for the next routine. It's an
 env-mapped phong object which changes its colors regularly. Afterwards a
 very nice @{" picture " system "Sys:Utilities/Multiview DemoGuidePics/Vision2.GIF"} is shown. It's on for quite a long time (but because of
 its high quality that doesn't really matter). Then it's time for some more
 plasma, a low-res plasma-zoomer, which slowly changes its style from
 normal zoom to waves (however, the resolution is a bit too low). The next
 routine is also groovy: We're inside a cave, not a traditional 3D scene,
 and it doesn't look like it's build from polygons, nor it is voxel. There
 is only one color shade used at a time, but it slowly fades between a
 range of colors. A flashlight lights up a circle on the columns that is in
 the cave. This routine needs quite a lot of CPU power, and I don't think
 that they've patched the demo to work on '040 and above. After the cave a
 simple vector star appears. Suddenly the background changes to a wallwrap
 mirroring this simple object, nice. The next object is a little more
 advanced (there's no background, though), this time it is some kind of
 gouraud shading which slowly changes its color, and furthermore it's
 blurred. Another 3D scene appears, still with standard vector planes.
 A man runs through a tunnel while a door closes at the end of the tunnel.
 He isn't well animated (not bad either), and like the other vector scenes
 this isn't pretty. Once again the credits are shown, this time with a nice
 wallwrap in the background.
 The music is a good piece of techno, not much to say about it I guess.
 Worth listening too, also without watching the demo.

Conclusion: To bad about those vector scenes, but it's an OK demo anyway.

+ Fast routines, pretty nice pictures
- Some routines with unclear display

Comment: This must be Freezers tribute to Wit Premium (a beer). But besides
 the name and a beer logo in the demo there's nothing that makes the viewer
 think of beer, non of the routines are beer-ish. For example the first
 routine is a very fast and "jumpy" trip through a "town" build up by big
 blue blocks. We're are moving either forward, backwards or to one of the
 sides, never turning, always looking the same direction. The speed and
 smoothness saves this routine, although the blocks look rather boring.
 The title is shown, some of it is shown with 2D vector graphic flying in
 front of the other half. Next routine is also vector, this time 3D. It's
 a little simple square thing with nice textures on some of it's sides.
 To bad it's so small. The next one is a plain texture mapped box, but
 unfortunately the display is very grumsy during this routine, which does
 that it doesn't look too good. The same partly goes for the next routine,
 however it doesn't matter that much as it is a plasma routine. It starts
 like a tunnel, but later we get to see it's true nature, nice! A nice
 picture is shown, followed by a fast vector object that splits into
 several small pieces, then joins and splits, etc. Another picture is
 shown, not as good as the other, but still quite okay. A zoom/rotator
 routine is on, it's okay too. The last routine is in some ways a bit
 disgusting, actually it's a combination of an axe and the picture that
 is shown right after the axe that makes it "work", but you have to watch
 this one for yourself... Finally there's a scrolltext (with one of the
 longest greetings-lists I've ever seen. It's impossible to know that
 many!).
 The music during the demo is techno, the one in the end is typical end-
 music...

Conclusion: You don't have to see this one, however, the speed is
 refreshing.

+ Some nice routines and pictures
- Some slow routines, bad change from part one to part two

Comment: A shaking text appears, followed by another, and another. Then a
 shaking bumpmap is shown. It shakes to the techno-music. It disappears and
 a rather slow plasma routine is on. Suddenly a transparent torus appears,
 also a bit slow, but the plasma isn't slown because of it. After that we
 are suddenly in a tunnel which changes its shape in the end away from the
 viewer, looks OK. Another boring change leads us to a lightly blurred
 phong object, then a rotating bumpmap (good), and finally to a nice
 picture. The picture is taken over by a plasma routine which looks as if
 it's sometimes one tunnel, sometimes two. It's fast and nice. And there's
 a lot of different kind of plasma. Part one of the demo is over and a
 short flash shows the Shell/WB, the second part is started shortly after.
 But it doesn't look nice with the flash and should have been avoided. The
 second part starts with the credits using a low-res water routine, which
 is OK. I wonder why there are so many musicians involved, the music is of
 a quite normal length and quality (that is pretty good). Next routine a
 nice moving bumpmap. Shortly after the same bumpmap rotates. A good
 picture of Sandra Bullock (pixeled by Pix that is) is shown. After that
 there's a transparent double tunnel, one zooms away from the viewer, the
 other towards the viewer. Looks nice and is fast too. The effects in the
 second part are generally shown for only a few seconds, the voxel
 landscape which is on next is shown a little longer. The colors are few,
 it isn't completely smooth, but the resolution good. And furthermore
 there's a short glance at the sun which results in lensflares... The last
 routine is a slow voxel-like 3D-blob, doesn't look very nice and is quite
 slow. And then the show suddenly ends.

Conclusion: Worth having a look at.

Comment: This looks like an old A500 demo, a pretty bad one too. Besides
 from a small bumpmap which only uses every second pixel and every second
 line all effects are simple and/or ugly. I'll mention them quickly: 3D
 starfield, slow light sourced vector object, not very smooth wireframe
 box, simple, jelly vector tunnel with an ugly color, slow morphing vector
 object. Things that were popular 10-12 years ago, today it's considered
 primitive and old-fashioned. If they at least had made the routines smooth
 and used a full palette instead of an ECS palette (few colors). But on the
 other hand I guess it runs on machines without AGA. But I wouldn't say
 that is positive since the demo sucks pretty much. When it ends there's
 a text asking you to wait for the end-text. The end-text, which is a
 horizontal bumpmapped scroller of the same type as before, is pretty nice
 compared to the rest of the demo, but...

Conclusion: Avoid!

+ Good graphic and music, some nice routines and changes
- Some slow routines

Comment: The show starts with a picture with a text in the bottom telling
 the first atmospheric lines of a story. A plasma is on while the groups'
 names are shown. Another picture is on, including a little animation.
 After that a transparent env-mapped phong object flies across the screen,
 and when it disappears the background picture suddenly changes into two
 transparent tunnel, one zooming towards you, the other away from you. It's
 fast and looks great! It disappears and a low resolution bumpmap, which
 aren't very fast, is on. A picture by Lazur is on, and shortly after this
 picture is scrolled around on the screen in 2x2 resolution and with three
 transparent glass balls flying in front of it. The balls stick together
 when it's possible (like soap bubbles). The balls and picture stop moving
 and in front of them a blurred phong object appears. The picture and the
 balls are slowly flushed away because of the blur. Unfortunately the phong
 is not too smooth, but besides from that it's okay. Later the credits are
 shown with a little blurred sign moving around in the background, and the
 credits themselves in the foreground. And afterwards there's even more
 phong: A lot of small, slow, texturemapped blobs fly around. You'll need
 a quite powerful computer to make this go smooth. The same goes for the
 bumpmapped blob that is on afterwards, and for the last routine, a big
 texturemapped phong object. The pictures in the demo are nice, and the
 synth/techno-pieces are quite atmospheric and fit the demo well.

Conclusion: Worth having a look at!

 blitterscreen. Suddenly a transparent circle appears in the middle of
 the thing, and from now on everything is seen through this circle, so that
 the colors are changed a bit. Later it starts to get even stranger (I
 won't try to explain that), and as time passes by (which it does) it looks
 more and more buggy...

+ Nice routines
- Strange colors, few routines

Comment: I guess this is one of the demos that the true techno freaks love,
 while the ones that dislike techno also dislikes this demo. It consists of
 no more than two or three routines, a quite fast color zoomer with a mess
 of various colors that are zoomed towards you or away from you, a fast
 fog voxel landscape (the part of it that are far away from you are either
 hidden in fog or in the dark), and a zooming rotator routine that might be
 a part of the color zoomer, they are combined, anyway. As mentioned the
 colors aren't exactly the best combination ever seen (everything from red
 to blue, from white to black are included), but when a blur routine is
 added to the zoomer, which happens now and then, it actually is quite
 nice. The demo changes between the two or three above mentioned routines,
 most of the time it is the color zoomer that is on, tends to get quite
 boring unless you've gone into some kind of trance before it starts to get
 dull. The music surely helps you getting into trance, for that's what it
 is, while the short flashes with pictures in between the routines probably
 convince your sub consciousness of something (for example: Vote for
 Cryptoburners! :)). The demo never ends (I guess), it just keeps looping
 the same routine and music again and again. Be careful not to fall into a
 trance when you're home alone, you might not be found again!

+ Nothing special as it is an old, quite traditional demo
- Simple effects

Comment: This is an old, quite traditional demo with everything that
 follows, good and bad. All the routines are quite simple seen with
 nowadays eyes, but still there are some of them that are quite nice.
 It begins with title pictures and the like that are shown according to the
 music, including the first effect: A fast line drawer routine. A quite
 nice transition leads us to the next routine, which is a blurred
 black/white rotator in a little box in the middle of the screen. A picture
 is shown afterwards, leading us to the next moving things, small three-
 colored cubes (about 10-12) flying randomly around with small pixel tails
 behind them. Another picture is on, again a pretty average one which goes
 for most of the graphic in the demo, and then there's a different scroll
 text, different because it's wrapped around an invisible ball. It's a bit
 difficult to read the colorful letters for the untrained scroll-reader,
 and also the ball is quite small, but the idea is good enough. Pixel
 effects are almost always nice, and the one in this demo is no exception.
 Quite traditional it draws different kinds of simple, symmetrical patterns
 and shapes, with a Desire logo shown next to it. Another picture, not too
 good, is on, then a fine little triangle-effect where a blurred triangle
 enters the screen, flies around for a short while, while it leaves a long
 tail behind it, a tail that doesn't disappear causing nice shapes made
 from small triangles to appear. The routine is on for a little too long to
 keep you attention, though. Finally we've reached the endscroller with a
 simple 3D-starfield in the background. Unlike many other demos (even
 though it is traditional) I only remember few black backgrounds, different
 kinds of colors (or what appear to be colors) are used instead.
 The music is a strange mixture of hiphop, heavy and techno, but it works.

Conclusion: Not a must see.

 While a lot of text is written on the screen a simple effect is shown, for
 example a zoomer, scroller or what looks like to be a bumpy window. The
 most complicated one is a picture that curls. All the effects are quite
 fast, but only few colors are used in the demo.
 The music is a melodic piece of jazz, quite good, fits the demo okay.

+ Some nice routines, pretty good design
- Better transitions would have been nice

Comment: I guess it's really a matter of taste if this demo should have won
 the Assembly, personally I like a couple of other demos from that party,
 but the bottom line is that it did win the party with about 1/3 more votes
 than the second place. Still, it's a good demo, no question about that,
 and actually it contains two quite impressive, plus a lot of other good
 stuff. Actually there are no of the routines that are directly bad, but
 some of them are a bit slow, that's why a '040 is recommended. Also the
 graphic is pretty good, so is the ambient techno music. All in all
 everything (more or less) seem to fit
 quite okay into the demo which starts with a title picture, which is
 shortly after used in a plasma. Unfortunately it's a bit slow, and so are
 the "fire"-letters that enter the screen afterwards. They spell the group
 name while rotating and zooming with a tale of what looks like a tail of
 fire after them. Basically it's just some vector letters that are put on
 fire, looks nice. The credits are up next, not just boring text screens,
 but two effects: The task is shown with rotating phong letters, while the
 names are shown with standard letters, then stretched away. The next
 effect is very cool, one of the best of its kind I've seen! It's a party
 twister build from what looks mostly like voxel, in fact it looks pretty
 much like a voxel landscape wrapped around a stick (just to give you an
 idea). Great. It's even better when colored lightsources start to pass by
 causing it to slowly change its color where the lightsources are. Both
 the resolution and speed are good, even on a '030/40 MHz. The same can't
 be said about the next routine, which is a texture mapped mask. The
 resolution is good, but the speed is unfortunate on less than an '040.
 A picture of an octopus is shown afterwards, and soon after an env-
 mapped glass slowly rotates in front of it. In opposite to the previous
 phong the resolution is now a bit low, while the speed is quite good.
 More phong is on next, a texture mapped blob, followed by a nice tunnel
 with hills coming out of its sides. It sometimes twists and the colors
 change creating a shadow effect. Another blob is shown next, this time
 it isn't phong, it rather looks as if it's build from the same routine
 that the party twister is build from. A little strange (but atmospheric)
 picture is shown afterwards, then more phong is presented, this time a
 very original object is used: A WV-bobble! The really exciting about this
 isn't the object itself, but its movement. It skids into the screen from
 the left, just like the cars in a good American action movie and exits
 only driving on its rear wheels... Finally we've reach the last routine,
 a good one too. At first it's what you'd believe to be a simple bumpmap
 routine, but shortly after it has started the map zooms away from the
 screen, and you discover that it's just one side of a column. And there
 are many columns in the wall-less "room". Very nice indeed.
 It all ends with a picture with the group's name written across it.

Conclusion: Recommended.

+ Nice routines, beautiful trace
- The music doesn't fit the demo, no quit

Comment: As mentioned above there are some timing problems with this demo
 when you run it on a A1200 and the like. Originally it's made for the good
 old Amigas (no AGA), but I haven't had the chance to test it on such.
 Anyway, it's not that bad and of course it will not affect the review or
 rating. One of the first thing you notice about this demo is the
 scrolltext in the bottom of the screen, and the CNN news line right above
 it. It's present almost all the time.
 The first routine is a vector doom routine (or animation?), no textures on
 the walls or anything, but with some colorful colors (?). After having
 spend some time walking around in those hallways you take off and discover
 that the walls are the letters PMC. Nice! Afterwards there are a lot of
 different vector objects of every kind, and then (after some depacking I
 guess) a beautiful raytraced animation appears, reminds me a lot of the
 one in Phenomena's Enigma, for those of you who haven't seen that one
 (you really should do yourself that favor to watch it) I can inform you
 that it's some transparent glass balls that reflect the fractal image
 beneath it. Simple, but great! And we stick to the fractal and animation,
 afterwards a little fractal zoomer is shown, it's quite smooth, but
 doesn't last for long before it is played backwards.
 I guess the people behind this demo are Star Wars fans (who aren't?), the
 3D vector objects and scenes shown as one of the last things in this demo
 are heavily inspired by the spacecrafts and the Death Star in Star Wars.
 Especially a sequence where you fly in a tunnel, then reaching a big room
 with some kind of pedestal in the middle reminds me of the scene in Return
 of the Jedi where the Death Star is blown up. Still no textures or fancy
 shadows are used, but what the hell, that was 1991!
 The demo ends with zooming letters that consist of letters that are
 zoomed that consist of letters that are zoomed that consist of letters
 that are zoomed that consist of letters that are zoomed, etc. :-)
 The graphic is difficult to judge, the timing problems do that the few
 logos in the demo are skipped, and the music doesn't fit the demo very
 well. It's way too happy and are unable to maintain the atmosphere that
 the visual part of the demo invites to. Too bad, but not a disaster.
 Anyway, as music used only for listening it's fine.

Conclusion: Watch it!

Comment: This demo is very different from almost all demos ever made, the
 reason is that it uses only two (2) colors: Dark green and black. All the
 effects are therefore dithered, unfortunately there aren't many effects,
 but the ones that are present runs very smooth. After some fast credits
 and texts the first routine is shown, it's a torus. Sounds simple (and is
 simple), but it's something completely different watching those raster
 effects instead of effects with hundred of colors, etc. Next routine is a
 zooming rotator and the last one is a fractal routine that are is
 difficult to see clearly because of the display. Also, a little naive
 "comic" is included. The music is a down-to-earth piece of rock,
 technically good, but nothing special.

 about 70% of the screen, but on the other hand everything moves smoothly
 and the resolution is quite acceptable. Too bad it's so short...

Comment: This production is one of those that takes most Amigas beyond what
is possible to do. Unfortunately this isn't meant as anything positive, in
fact this means that only Amigas equipped with a fast '040 processor or
better will be able to enjoy the demo (if it works on those processors at
all). The reason for all this complaining is the frame rate throughout most
of the show, often it's below ten frames per second on a 1230-40MHz (which
was used for this test), but then again I believe that it might have been
made for the powerful MC's. Often two different routines are on at the same
time (for example a phong object with a tunnel in the background), and the
resolution is 1x1 throughout the whole demo (or maybe there are one effect
which aren't in this resolution). To try to boost the speed a little Kloo
has cut of the left and right edge of the display area, so that everything
is shown in a square box. There are some effects that run at an acceptable
speed, but without ever being really fast, though.
The demo contains many different routines, most of them aren't shown for
very long, so you're somehow entertained all the time. However, nobody
seem to have taken care of the design, so the constant stream of effects
never really "catches" you, non of visual impressions you get from the demo
relate to other of the demo's parts, luckily the techno/house music is
there to hold the pieces together, even though it's a difficult job. It
doesn't succeed completely, but somewhat saves it from being a total mess.
Just to mention some of the effects (I will only mention the most
interesting ones) I could describe the very first routine: A nice
combination of four or five different effects, that is rotating,
stretching, zooming, bumpmapped plasma! In front of this the credits are
shown, or more correctly most of them are shown, because the rightmost
letters seem to have disappeared beyond the display area's border. If this
is so called design or if it's an error is an unanswered question, but I
tend to believe in the last of the two possibilities. The reason why is
that some of the later effects have also gone over the border, but instead
of just disappearing they appear on the other side of the screen...
Anyway, the effect is good, but lasts to short I guess. The title is shown
afterwards using a colored bumpmap, almost looking like a piece of tinfoil.
One of the best routines in the demo (maybe except for the start effect)
is a view over the ocean. Nah-Kolor have made a quite realistic water
effect, looks just like if you're standing on a dune near the beach looking
over the ocean. Another interesting effect is a voxel vulcan where lava
slowly appear from the top of it running down its sides. This routine is
slow though, the colors few and would probably have looked better if some
small pixel explosions could be added, we want a real eruption (waiting for
the PPC to come!)! The last effect in the demo is some kind of Doom routine
where you're flying around in a wall-less room filled with square columns
with different pictures or animations on them. On the texts that are
presented in the bottom of each effect it says something about some
bumpmap and mirrors, but to be honest this is difficult to see, maybe if
you look very closely, but... The speed is surprisingly good (still it's
not more than acceptable, though).
The demo is generally rather colorful, but somehow the palette doesn't seem
to have been used to its full extend, sometimes causing bad color fades.
This combined with the "design" and the bugs leave a not too positive
impression of this demo, but the music pulls it up a little. Also the
pictures presented drags it up a little, unfortunately non of them fits the
demo very well (or else they both do because it's such a mess already!),
but seen as single pictures there are mostly positive things to say about
them. Especially Lazur's contribution (I believe it took part at one of The
Party's GFX compos) is a beauty.
Despite the lack of design and the messy look many of the effects are
actually worth having a look at, especially on fast machines. A standard
A1200 is totally out of the question though, but then again isn't it always
nowadays?

Conclusion: Watch ones...

+ The idea is great
- The effects are very old and common

Comment: A very unusual demo. It is a demonstration where the effects that
 are usually shown with "normal" graphic, are converted so that they use
 characters instead, and all run in a Cli-window!
 After a little introduction text the demo starts with some '*' stars that
 are formed as a 3D "wireframed" cube in rotation on all of its axis and a
 dot circular tunnel made with 'O' letters. Then a full window zooming
 mandelbrot fractal picture, made with ANSI chars that explode in a big ANSI
 star, is shown. After the credits and a picture (everything is the work of
 the ASCII artist Morph) a strange partial scrolltext rotates and zooms
 an "IMPACT DK" logo, afterwards it explodes resulting in hundred of *.
 Then, after some "shading chars", a great ANSI animation realized with
 Scenery Animator and converted to chars fills the window. Now the most
 "difficult" effects made (they say) is on using system routines: Seven
 ANSI vectorballs zooms and rotates into the window, and a cool ANSI filled
 and ligthsourced 3D cube appears. At last an "endcli" command stops the
 demo and starts the greetings-part this time in normal bitmap on some
 dotted fractal backgrounds (hey... and the ASCII?).
 The first piece music is a normal piece in demo style well synchronized
 with effects, and the greetings music is a quite good remake of Martin
 Galways's Parallax highscore tune from the C64.

Conclusion: Do you work on a BBS screen every day? You'll love it!
 Others you won't appreciate it too much. Worth watching only ones.

+ Nothing, everything is pretty average
- Strange (non-existing?) design, some routines are a bit slow, pictures
  are below average

Comment: I must admit that I wasn't very entertained when watching this
 demo. First of all the "design" is, to be nice, different (to be honest:
 non-existing), and also the routines have all been seen better before.
 Every single effect is using colors that don't match anything else in
 rest of the demo, which results in a big color mess. Only if the effects
 are watched separately you might think it's nice, but watched one by one
 as in a typical demo (like this one) there's nothing to hold it together.
 The many different logos and pictures, different especially concerning
 style and quality, only make the design worse. The graphic isn't exactly
 state of the art, to be positive one could say that it's different. Also
 the pretty well timed music, won't be remembered in the next century, but
 has its bright moments. It's a piece that consists of both an atmospheric
 tune and a techno tune, it changes to the appropriate kind of music when
 needed according to the demo. More or less successful.
 The routines are a simple tunnel with ugly textures, a nice "old-glass"
 effect, some kind of plasma that looks like watching a picture through
 old-fashioned glass, traditional phong and simple 2D-metaballs.
 The effect that really saves this demo is a transparent phong object (a
 bend torus) that morphs into a blob and back again a couple of times,
 while the background zooms and rotates. The speed is quite good which is
 rather impressive, especially concerning that it runs in 1x1. Still I
 wonder about the choice of colors. Also worth mentioning is a very short
 looping 3D-animation where you are walking up a stair, not that it is so
 very good, but at least you don't see that every day in a demo...
 All in all a demo where nothing really seems to fit, anyway the parts that
 works are worth watching.

Conclusion: There are better demos out there for sure!

+ Hmmm...
- Monotone

Comment: A strange little demo that only contains (more or less) one
 effect, phong in yellow and pink colors, butterflies (!?) and backgrounds
 from beneath the surface of the sea (scans).
 The show starts with a zooming and slowly rotating DCS logo which is
 shortly after taken over by a phong routine with different transparent
 shapes flying around, and thanks to the few colors used in the demo they
 look a bit strange, the colors don't fade right. Butterflies are on next,
 lots of them with fast moving wings. And it continues like this a couple
 of minutes, phong and butterflies... And then, after the credits, it ends.
 The music is believed to be some kind of hiphop variation, not a success
 (hiphop rarely is), but has the same quality level as rest of the demo...
 I still wonder about the title...

Conclusion: For people that tends to like strange demos, insects and
 scooping!

+ "Interesting" reset function
- This is not a real demo, just advertising or similar, no quit

Comment: The name of this short demo is more or less well chosen. More
 because it really is short, more than 3 seconds, still not much more than
 10-15 seconds, less because of the "Delight" word. It sure is not a
 delight watching this production that is to short to be called a demo,
 and it does not have any routines in it. The only that happens is that
 three different mostly brown screens with some text on them are shown,
 then it starts all over again. The music is a very distorted piece of
 electric church music, strange.
 You can't quit the demo by pressing the mouse or ESC, but when you reset
 another part starts, also just some text, but with a slightly different
 design, and the music in this part is techno. When you reset again you
 really reset!

Conclusion: Forget it, I guess it is a 3 second production!

+ There's a message in the demo!
- The demo doesn't seem to be a perfect work of art, the code is a bit
  slow, the music a class or two below the "professionel" demo music
  (but is atmospheric)

Comment: The demo starts with a black/white movie with a pretty low frame
 rate and poor picture quality, while an atmospheric piece of music that
 could need some polishing, plays in the background. A quite violent movie,
 and that's what the demo is about: Violence, death and destruction.
 After the moviepart some more "normal" demo effects are shown, spiced up
 with lots of pictures presenting war, famine, death, etc. The effects are
 slow phongs, traditional bumpmap, a tunnel with mountains coming out of
 its sides and the like, pretty much the usual stuff, seen faster before!
 The music isn't state of the art, but still it's good for creating some
 kind of gloomy atmosphere that somewhat saves the demo a little.
 And by the way, this demo really has got a (sensible) message!

Conclusion: For people with fast processors!

Inside information:

 - The pictures in the demo were leeched from CNN's homepage, then
   processed
 - Venture thought about releasing this demo on Somewhere in Holland, but
   decided not to, as most of the crew was going to IO3 anyway.
 - They started working on this demo about two weeks before the party.

+ Fast routines
- Mostly simple routines, graphics from PD libraries

Comment: If somebody asked me when this demo was released and I didn't
 know, I would have guessed it was in the early '90s, but as written
 above it's from 1997. The reason of this mis-judgement is that the
 routines are all quite simple, and the only thing that could indicate that
 this is not a non-AGA demo, is, of course, the colors used, even though I
 guess it's hard to see that it actually uses a full 256 color palette.
 The show starts with the demo's name and title fading in, followed by a
 nice picture exposed to a plasma working only on the y-axis. The next
 routine is a simple grid cube with a couple of blurry lines after it. This
 part is on for a long time, unfortunately, because it is so simple and is
 unable to keep even a hardcore old-Scener interested for very long. After
 a while it starts flashing from the current effect to one where the cube
 is checked (transparent/purple) and back again, it does this a couple of
 times. A very nice picture by Lazur is on, and like the other pictures in
 the demo it seems to have been chosen randomly, it has nothing to do with
 anything else in the demo. A simple, low-res "wrap-around-a-ball" routine
 is the next moving thing, that is, the ball doesn't move, the picture
 does. After a while small balls start appearing in front of the big ball,
 quite uninteresting as long as it's just a copy of the big ball instead of
 mirroring it or similar. Two 3D vector objects (so it seems) are on next,
 but actually there are more, as one of them starts to fall apart into
 several spinning fragments. For a demo from 1997 this isn't too fancy, it
 would have been 5-6 years ago I guess... A scanned B/W picture is on
 before a fast, low-res rotator takes over. Doesn't look too nice because
 it is quite "grumsy", but the speed somewhat saves it. Finally we have
 reached the endscroller, a simple 3D-starfield zoom towards you in the
 background in this part.
 The music in the main part is techno that tends to be quite monotone, in
 the endpart it's a nice little chiptune.

Conclusion: Not really worth watching

+ Nice ideas, some good routines, atmospheric music
- Needs a lot of CPU power

Comment: This demo is far from the usual LED productions, both concerning
 speed and concept. For those who don't know LED's normal style I'll tell
 you that it's fast, colorful and quite entertaining demos. This demo is
 almost the opposite, that is slow, few colors and, in my opinion, not too
 entertaining. But scary! Pentagrams, a ghost and an atmospheric, gloomy
 soundtrack makes this demo one of the most scary ones yet!
 The show starts with some kind of lightsourced plasma (pretty nice)
 followed by the group's name, credits (shown with a smooth blur morph
 routine) and the title. A lightspot effect in fog, one of those that
 points towards
