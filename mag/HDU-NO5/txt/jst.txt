JOTD Startup: THE ULTIMATE GAMESTARTER FROM 
WORKBENCH

As you could notice, I created and uploaded many HD-Install & fix 
programs for non-dos games, but all of them were standalone, 
and in case of an error in the general loader routines, I had to 
remake the loader (relink) and upload again.

Bert Jahn had developped WHDLoad, which solves this problem 
because it allows to load small, game-specific loaders and run 
them using its own degrade/hd/dos code. This technique allows 
easy updates in case of bugs or new functionnalities.

That's what I decided to do myself. JST was born from a 8-hour 
adaptation of my link library. It's an equivalent to WHDLoad but a 
bit more powerful, as the system can be called in the slave loader, 
messages can be printed, a gui can be opened, there are lots of 
cool functions, and much more. It also allows easier programming 
of loaders (but WHDLoad is still cool!), and can run normal DOS 
programs in degraded mode (68060 support).

From V0.3 I decided to ask a fee of US$10, 20DM, 7£ or 50FF to 
be able to become a registered user. However, I will register 
whoever I think he or she did something cool for me (already sent 
disks, money, sports cars, Sandra Bullock clones...). Lots of 
people are already on the list. If you think I forgot you, contact me.
To register, send the money to:

Jean-François Fabre
19 Rue Emile Duploye
34500 BEZIERS
FRANCE

Specify your e-mail or send a blank disk with the money (for 
non-internet users), and I'll send you the registered version of JST 
(+the latest installs for the ones who sent a floppy but specify 
which ones in priority as the whole archive is big).
