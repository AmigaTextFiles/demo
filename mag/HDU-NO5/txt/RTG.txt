  Rtgmaster Developer Archive
  Author:   MagicSN@Birdland.es.bawue.de
==========================================

This is part of the new rtgmaster release V24.0. rtgmaster is a 
library system to make GFX Board Compatible Game Coding 
easy. It supports :

- Direct Access to the Video RAM
- With some effort the code even runs on ECS/AGA (through    
c2p)
- Supports nearly all WB Emulations
- And much more

This part of the archive is for the developper. It contains 
Binaries and Demos, Autodocs and Includes. You might be 
interested in getting the Driver Archive, additionally, if you do 
not want having to bother with Library/OS Coding. This Driver 
Archive contains an example driver where you do not have to 
know about this. This is all done internally in the driver.

The other rtgmaster archives are rtgmaster_user.lha and 
rtgmaster_driv.lha. The Driver Archive contains the Binaries 
and an Example Driver that can be used to add GFX Board 
Support to a game without knowing something about 
Library/OS Coding, the User Archive contains Demos and 
Binaries (they are also contained here, though).
