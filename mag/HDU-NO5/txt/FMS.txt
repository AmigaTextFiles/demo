 FILE BASED TRACKDISK SIMULATOR
==========================================

What does it do and why ?
-------------------
A friend of mine recently got a CD-Rom drive, and had a few 
CD's on which the archives were stored using DMS or some 
other track-packer.  I found out about FMS  off  of  AmiNet.   
FMS  allows  you to Un-DMS or whatever direct to your 
hard-disk by providing a FF0:  device, which acts like a virtual 
floppy disk.

I installed the device, and used it, which seemed great.  Some 
time later, I decided  to  do  some experiments with fms-
disk.device and find out if I could make it faster. Well. If you  
use DiskSpeed or some similiar program, you'll see that I've  
managed to decrease the CPU usage, whilst slightly increas-
ing performance on most tests. In addition to this, my device is 
also quite a bit smaller.

As well as unmashing CD archives, FMS is useful perhaps for.
People creating floppy based distributions, where they can 
quickly fill up the FFx: with all required files, and then DISK-
COPY FFx: Dfx:

About installation, requirements and other useful stuff please 
consult documentation.
