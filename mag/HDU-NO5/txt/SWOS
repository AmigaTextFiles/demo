The SWOS TEAM EDITOR 3.0 Guide
==========================================
Installation
The installation is a really simple operation. Everything 
is controlled by a standard Commodore Installer script. 
All you've got to do is to click on the install icon and
follow the instructions. Be careful to put the "RNCDepack" 
on a path directory (default is C:). To install the program
on a disk , you've got to format a disk and make it 
bootable via "install UNIT:" Amigados command
(e.g. install df0:). Then launch the install program and 
locate the files on the disk.
If you have a copy of Propack (not included , since it's
a commercial product) put it on the c: directory or in the
program directory.

Instructions
