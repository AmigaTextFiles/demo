    Diversia
=============================================
It's been a while since I looked at this game and it has progressed 
quite nicely in that time. The game is now 65% complete and is 
beginning to look like it could be something really special. One 
thing that does need clearing up regarding the game is what has 
happened to the demo. Well, it has actually been released, how-
ever, only to interested publishers. They thought it better to hold
the demo back until we are closer to the games release.

Since the last news article there has been a lot of new features 
added to the game. The total number of buildings that the game 
now has is up to 16, these range from simple Power Stations & Oil 
Mines to factories and laser turrents. There have also been a vari-
ety of air units added, you can see the a picture showing one of 
these, the helicopters, on this page.

Two of the screenshots on this page are from the Low-Res ver-
sion, to some the buildings/units may look rather large, well, if so 
then the Hi-Res version is for you.  The other screenshot here is 
from this version and I'm sure you'll agree, it looks excellent.  How-
ever, to play it at any kind of speed you'll need an 040/40. On a 
030/50 or anything less it just isn't playable.  Seems like another 
reason to get that upgrade if you ask me.  In fact it is actually
possible to play the game in resolutions of 800x600 and  
1024x768, how fast they are though, I don't know.  For most 
though, I'm sure the Low-Res version will be quite Ok.

Other features that have been added include animation to build-
ings, a bubble help option, an increase in terrain size - now 
1024x1024, 2048x2048 & 4096x4096 are supported, an improv-
ment in the pathfinder and much more.  Something that will please 
Graphic Card owners is that the game has now been successfully 
been tested on CyberGFX systems. Things still to add include 
many new units and building, research facilitys, improved CPU in-
telligence, a network mode, video-phone messaging and much 
more.

Like I said, the game still has quite a distance to go before it is fin-
ished, however, the authors are looking to release the game either 
Late '97 or Early '98.

Exclusive: FratzenGeballer, Followup to Trapped 2.
=============================================
Following on from my previous article on the follow-up to Trapped 
2, I can now bring you more information.  The game, which will be 
called 'FratzenGeballer' is the third in the series of 3D games from 
Oxyron.  The first game 'Trapped' was a slight dissapointment, 
however, Trapped 2 went on to improve on it in a massive way, 
hopefully 'FratzenGeballer' will continue this.improvment.

The game will contains the same 3D engine which is used in 
Trapped 1&2, however, it will not be sold as a sequal but instead 
as a completly new game. The storyline of the game will be far 
different from the first one giving it a whole new feel and also 
allowing buyers of the earlier two games to enjoy it too.

The game, I'm told, has been improved in many different areas.
It features an 'unbeliveable 3D engine' which boasts many 
spectacular effects such as improved texture mapping, 
Mipmapping, Dithering, Lensflare and some excellent light
effects all of which will be improved over the earlier engine 
versions.

The game itself takes place in a Space Station, you will have to 
fight your way over more then 15 levels of action.  The game will 
have all new enemys with some excellent new weapons in which 
to kill them with. I have also been told that it will include many new 
features not seen in the previous 2 games.

The game is set of an early summer '98 release with a demo
being released very soon.

==================================================
Myst Finally Complete
==================================================

Yes, thats right, Myst is finally complete.  It has been approved by 
Cyan and is now entering the final beta testing stage.  Boxes and 
manuals are already complete so it is just a matter of CD duplica-
tion, packaging and shipping.

The game should be available by December the 1st at the latest, 
hopefully even earlier.   The game will be available for $65 direct 
from PXL Computers, look at your local suppliers for prices in 
other currencies.

Myst, which is the best selling game of all-time has been eagerly 
awaitied by the Amiga public ever since it was announced by 
Clickboom earlier this year. Amiga Myst will be available in two 
versions, English & German.  This is because it was impossible to 
put versions for both languages on the same CD due to space
limitations.

Initially the game will only be released as AGA only, this is be-
cause the CyberGFX version us not yet complete, however, all of 
the GFX files required will be on the CD so it will only be a matter 
of downloading the CyberGFX code off the Clickboom website, 
Aminet or from magazine coverdisks when it is ready (It should be 
sometime in the first week of December).  The same goes for the
PPC optimised version, this is also not quite ready yet and will be 
made avaialble as soon as it is.

As I'm sure many of you know Myst will be 100% OS Friendly and 
will be fully multi-tasking. As for the Amiga required to play the 
game, well, you'll need a pretty decent one to be able to play it at 
a good speed.   For the AGA version the minimum spec is a 68020 
CPU with 8Mb RAM, a 2x CD-ROM drive and 5Mb HD space.  
The minimum recommended spec is 68030 with 16Mb RAM.  To 
play the game at it's best a 68060 with 16Mb RAM and a 12x 
CD-ROM drive is recommended.  This is the same for the Cy-
berGFX version apart from the recommended spec is an 040 in-
stead of an 060.

Press Release: Quake from Clickboom?
=================================================

The Amiga Quake rumor has completely gotten out of hand - since 
Computer '97 show in Cologne, some ten days ago, we have re-
ceived well over a thousand email letters and numerous telephone 
calls. They all had the same question: "Is it true that clickBOOM 
will be releasing Quake for the Amiga?" We had quite a few in-
quires of this nature even before Computer '97, but we basically 
decided not to address any of them. At the show, however, the 
word spread quickly among Amiga enthusiasts, and the electronic 
siege on ClickBOOM started. We hoped it would end shortly after. 
It didn't. On the On the contrary, the word had spread even faster 
over the Internet.

We would like to take this opportunity to apologize to all users who 
wrote to us (some even five times) and never got an answer.  "So, 
what is the answer?" ,you are asking. We do not have a definite 
answer yet. However, it is true that we are in talks with ID Software 
to legalize this unbelievable action game for the Amiga. The news 
will be posted to our site as soon as everything is finalized 
(positive or negative).

The reason we are posting this "news" is because we could not 
ignore your letters any more. While we have the obligation to an-
swer, as you can see, the final answer is still not here. Therefore, 
we would kindly ask of you to just hold on with your barrage of 
email until the final news. We can not cope with such amount of 
letters, especially when we do not have the real answer.We hope
to have more for you very soon.

All very interesting I'm sure you'll agree.  As it sayd above there 
will hopefully be more info soon.  As soon as it is available, it'll be 
on this page. Also I ask you to stop emailing Clickboom, you'll will 
not get anything more then you have been told here mainly be-
cause they don't know anything else.
