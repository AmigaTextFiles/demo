1.  StartE/Introduction
Do you have a program on your HD that needs as much memory 
as it can grab? Does this mean you have to resort a tiny 
Startup-Sequence and/or rubbish preferences, to save as much 
memory as possible upon booting? Well you need do this 
no-longer. StartE lets you have an extra 10 Startup-Sequences, 
that can be used to do anything. Take my 5 extra for example... 
These 5 startup sequences all work wonderfully, but having to 
rename them as Startup-Sequence each time I wanted to use 
them, would become tedious. This is where StartE comes in.

2.  StartE/Usage
StartE is very simple to use. The StartE program which should 
accompany these docs does not have an icon, and should be 
copied to the C directory. Then the following should be added to 
your Startup-Sequence...

C:StartE
If EXISTS RAM:Temp.BAT
Execute RAM:Temp.BAT
EndIf

This means, when you first boot, StartE will be run, it will check to 
see if the right mouse button is held down, if so then the program 
will continue, if not then it will quit back to your Startup-Sequence. 
Since RAM:Temp.BAT will not exist, your startup will continue as 
normal. If however you hold the right mouse button down during 
booting, then the program will attempt to look for a file called 
S:StartupPrefs. If this is not found, StartE will return an error.  
S:StartupPrefs contains the information for your boot menu. 
S:StartupPrefs can be created/edited using any ASCII text editor 
like ED. The first line of the file should be the menu title, with the 
remaining lines made up as follows. One line containingg the 
menu text for that option, then a line containing the corresponding 
script file to use as the new Startup-Sequnce. StartE will then 
present you with the options, and wait for you to press the 
corresponding number key, or the ESC key to abort. If for 
example you presses '2' to use the Tiny startup, then the file 
S:Startups/Tiny will be copied to RAM:Temp.BAT, and so it would 
be executed.  So my startup would consist of the contents of 
S:Startups/Tiny which is...

EndCLI

It's a good idea to end all your startups with EndCLI to prevent 
them from returning to your original Startup-Sequence. That's 
about it, if you have any problems mail me.
