MultiTrash v1.0
==============================================

Introduction
Q. OK, what is this?
A. A Workbench Appicon Trashcan.

Q. But why? The Workbench already has a trashcan!
A. Yes, but the Workbench trashcan is limited.  It will only hold files 
from it's own disk.  If you have several HD partitions, you would 
need to have a trashcan for each one.  And they can't be left out on 
the Workbench, to say nothing of the hassel of periodically cleaning
each one out.

Q. OK, I see your point. But there are already several of these 
"Global Appicon Trashcan" programs. Why another? 
A. Because I couldn't find one that had all the features I wanted. So 
I wrote my own.

Q. OK, what's yours do that the other ones don't?
A. First, you get 2 trashcan appicons. One for deleting files, as 
usual. And a second for simply removing the icons, but leaving the 
files alone. Second, you can specify a list of file extensions to be 
removed along with the "dragged" files.  For example, if your text 
editor saves a backup of your text files, with the extension  
".backup". You can set MultiTrash to delete these automatically too, 
so when you drag a file called "My text" onto the Appicon, it will 
also remove the "My text.backup" file. Third, you get a visual 
indication when the file is deleted. (a skull and bones image 
appears briefly to show that the file is being deleted). Fourth, you 
can set it to send deleted files to your SYS:trashcan directory if you 
wish. Yes, all files from any partition or disk will all go to the same 
place.  And yes, if you just remove the icons from files or drawers, 
they will go there too. Fifth, you can have a saftey requester appear 
before anything is deleted in case of mistakes. Sixth, you can have 
a sound sample played when deleting. Yes, you can have a 
different one for file deletion and icon removal. And last, ALL of 
these features are completely optional. As far as I know, none of 
the other Global Trashcans have all these features.
