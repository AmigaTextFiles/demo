==============================================
SGrab 1.7
==============================================
A screen and window grabber that is based on CyberGrab by 
Stefan Proels.

Purpose
SGrab is a utility which allows you to save screens or windows as 
ILBM or JPEG files. SGrab supports all display-modes provided by 
p96/cgfx or by the native chipsets. This program is based on Stefan 
Proels' great CyberGrab. I decided to write a new grabber, because 
Stefan lost the source code of CyberGrab so that he isn't able to 
make changes to it.

Requirements
- An Amiga, CPU 68020 or better
- OS 3.0 or better
