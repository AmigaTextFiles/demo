  NEWS ABOUT AMIGA GAMES - part ONE
===============================================


Lambda
===============================================
I'm glad to inform you that development of thie very promicing 
title is moving alonf nicely. A lot has happened to the engine 
since any news was last reported, the game engine is now upto 
20.81. Apparantly, it has changed in a massive way since the last 
public release and there has been a host of new features that 
have been added to the game. these include : Preliminary 
artificial intelligence support including obstacle avoidance, 
navigations and combat intelligence, new effects including new 
weapon, explosion and HUD effects. This is one area in which 
the new engine is far improved over the original one. Other 
additions includes AHI support for sound, a squadran of new 
ships and general coding improvments. Moving on, the code has 
now been compiled on a PPC. Initial tests saw the game running 
at an amazing 70fps on a Cyberstorm 200mhz. However, it still 
isn't decided if PPC support will be continued.

===============================================
Enforce
===============================================
There hasn't been that much information on this game for quite a 
while nbow, however, I can bring you a small update on some 
new features that have been added to the game. New additions 
include TCP support to allow deathmatches over the Internet, 3D 
stereo sound, enemy intelligence, Virge support, a script 
language that allows you to alter virtually anything in the game, 
real-time explosions and more. There will hopefully be some new 
screenshots andmaybe a new demo not to far in the future, I'll 
bring you more information just as soon as I have it.

The first issue of this Amiga only Games magazine has now been 
released and is available for purchase from its producers. The 
Amiga has been devoid of a good games print magazine ever 
since the sad demise of Amiga Power, finally we have something 
that may be able to fill the wide expance that was left by this 
magazine. In the first issue of Amiga Survivor you can find a 
massive amount of Amiga games related material. This includes a 
hugh Genetic Species review, two different views on the World of 
Amiga '98 show, Aminet Ramblings, Website of the Month, loads

and much, much more. It really is worth buying this first issue if 
only to show your support for what they are doing, who knows, you 
may even like it. The magazine is currently only available directly 
from the producers, this is due to the hugh costs that would be 
involved in newsstand publication. However, hopefully in the future 
you will be able to find it on your local newstand. To order a copy

Networ
===============================================
Networ is yet another Command & Conquer game that is being 
written for the Amiga. The game is still in its early stages so there 
isn't a great deal known about the game however I do have some 
early screenshots and some details on the game that may yet be 
built upon. The game is being developed by a team called Atomic 
Interactive (I say team even though it is currently only made up of 
one person). Even though it is a Command & Conquer clone its 
not just this, the author plans to implement things into the game 
which will make it quite different to this game. The first of these 
and the only one that is currently implemented is that it contains a 
floating toolbar, the game is played in full screen, the controls are 
found in a dragable window like panel. Other features that the 
game contains includes real-time shadows and some other things 
which are being kept under wraps. The game engine currently runs 
at a respectable 16fps, even this is fast enough but it will be even 
better with a faster processor. The game fully multi-tasks and runs 
on an intuition screen. It will be released on CD-ROM only and will 
have support for AGA as well as GFX card users. Like I said, the 
game is still in a very early stage of development and machine 
specs required have not yet been set, however, the author 
antisipates at least a 68030/50mhz with 8/16Mb of RAM, a 
CD-ROM drive and either AGA or Graphics card will be required.
      Like I said earlier, this game is currently being written by just 
one person. Because of this the author is looking for someone to 
help with the game, partically in the GFX department, he is also 
looking for someone to help with a storyline/sernario for the game. 
Anyone who is interested can get in contact with the author at the 
following address : 
atomic-interactive@nwn.de 

I will bring you more info as soon as I get it.

Alive MediaSoft to Publish Putty Squad.
===============================================
Yes, thats right. At last, we are finally going to be able to play Putty 
Squad on our Amigas. Thanks to Alive Mediasoft this highly rated 
game is going to get the Amiga release that so many people 
hoped for. For those of you that do not remember, Putty Squad is 
an AGA only platform game with a difference. Instead of guiding a 
charactor though many levels with control a blob of putty. Its not 
just any old blob of Putty though, you can make it perform all kinds 
of different movements including moving between platforms by 
streaching itself, jumping, and also a number of offensive 
movements to help you fend off the enemies.
The game, which was coded by System 3,  was originally set for 
release way back in 1995 (Or sometime around then) and received 
a number of very good reviews from the Amiga Press. However, 
the release date kept getting put back time after time until it was 
announced that it would no longer be released. Ever since then 
many Amiga owners have been crying out for someone to pick the 
game up and release it, after all, it was completly finished.  At last, 
this has finally been done by Alive.
At the moment the game will only be released on disk, however, 
Alive have not ruled out a CD-ROM version. The price is expected 
to be £14.99, however, those that pre-order the game will only 
have to pay £12.99. Now, a small note that I would like you to 
follow-up on if you are interested. The game is still in the early 
stages of the release process and Alive have not yet decided how 
many copies to duplicate.  What they need is an idea of how many
copies they will need to duplicate, the licence for the this game is 
not cheap and Alive really want to make this a great release for the 
Amiga. So, if you are interested and want to show your support for 
the game give Alive a quick email saying so, even if its just a 
simple 'Yes - I want Putty Squad" that will do just fine.

The address to send your emails to is:- Stevenalive@innotts.co.uk

I will hopefully have more info & screenshots very soon.
