==============================================
New time preferences replacement V40.1ß4
Author : amigafan@cityweb.de (Thomas Pucyk)
Requires: OS 3.0+ (v39), 020+
==============================================

This litte program is indended to replace the old and badlooking 
time preferences of Workbench 3.0+. This clone really deserves 
the version number 39 and up. It includes an handcrafted 
font-sensitive Gadtools GUI (i hate MUI) and backfill- patterns. 
BUT! It is far from being complete. I am too lazy this year and my 
exams are coming towards me so if you like this litte proggie and 
want it to be completed, email me in mass and motivate me to 
complete it. I have gadget help and perhaps a analog clock in the 
window in mind. Anyway this is what the WB3.1 programs should 
all look like. (Hope the guys of Amiga Inc. will do it better)

This FIFTH upload is now FULLY localized. (Till now only a 
german catalog included) If anyone wants to do a catalog file, the 
descriptor file is included. (But you have to define the shortcuts for 
the GUI by hand till now, I will probably automate this one of the 
next releases). Please email the finished catalog to me so I can 
add it to the archive.

It has NINE supported tooltypes.
1. PUBSCREEN:  should be self-explanatory (e.g. PUBSCREEN = 
Workbench)
2. PATTERN : the pattern to load for backfill (e.g. PATTERN = 
Patternname)
3. AMPM : chooses if a 24h or 12h clock to be displayed (e.g. 
AMPM = TRUE)
4. MONTHSTYLE: chooses if the month in the textgadget has to 
be written by name or by number (MONTHSTYLE=NAME or 
MONTHSTYLE = NUMBER)
5. SIZEGADGET: chooses if a sizegadget should be used (e.g. 
SIZEGADGET = TRUE) to give the SIZEGADGET-tooltype a 
sense you can now choose the window dimensions through 
tooltypes.
6. WINLEFT : x-position of window (defaults to 0)
7. WINTOP : y-position of window
8. WINWIDTH  : width of window (defaults to 350)
9. WINHEIGHT : height of window (defaults to 250)

BUGS:
none, so far. (Perhaps the unfinished GUI IMHO:). This software is 
BETA and should be considered being not finished. Usage at own 
risk.
