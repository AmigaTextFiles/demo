The Latest from Jeff Schindler - August 25, 1998
==============================================
It's been a very long and hot summer here at Amiga, Inc. 
headquarters. We have been busy and working steadily to secure 
Amiga's future. While we have missed the announced target date 
for our OS partner, we have continued to negotiate, execute 
contracts, and work on our plans for the next generation Amiga. I 
can promise you that we have been working very hard. We are 
even more excited about the future than ever before, but we are 
determined to do it right and this takes time. 

One evening at home I was reminded how important doing things 
right is. One of my family's favorite things to do in the evenings is to 
watch a movie or play interactive adventure games. We all headed 
out to the nearest store to make a selection. With our wallet in our 
hand, we all stood in front of an array of games. We selected the 
Titanic adventure. I proudly explained to our children that the 
Amiga was used in part of the production of the movie Titanic. We 
all agreed that this would be a great game looked forward to seeing 
what "adventure" awaited us at home. And an "adventure" it was!! 
We all gathered in our home theatre room, in front of the 
Destination PC/TV, and proceeded to install the game. My wife and 
our four children were excited to play and the "adventure" began. 
We loaded the game...and it CRASHED! Then we noticed a yellow 
insert, titled WARNING with a long list of instructions. It had us turn 
off features that would degrade the video and audio quality and 
slow the CD ROM performance. We carefully followed each step 
(under great protest I would like to add). You see, we have a 
loaded system, with all the latest technology, and believe me I want 
to use every bit!! Slowly one by one, our kids left the room. Each of 
them saying..."let me know when you get it running, Dad". Our 7 
year old son James was the only one who sat by earnestly waiting 
for the Titanic adventure to come alive. What he ended up seeing 
was ... black screens with a white hourglass and his Dad getting 
ready to throw the wireless keyboard through the 32 inch monitor!! 
After two hours of shutting the machine down and re-booting our 
adventure was over (before it started). With anger and 
disappointment, we put the game back into it's box, to return to the 
store. The only thing that kept going through my mind was "it 
shouldn't be this way". Just like the Titanic, no matter how massive, 
nothing is unsinkable! 
It really "sunk" in....why the Amiga is different and why it's so 
important for us to reach our vision for the future Amiga and get it 
right. Thanks for your continued support and patience, you make 
Amiga what it is. Remember, its "adventures" like this that keep 
Amiga in our hearts.

Update: Trauma Zero
==============================================
I said last week that I was awaiting further details of Trauma Zero 
and as expected the developers sent more extensive info on what 
we should expect to see in Trauma Zero along with some new 
screenshots. 
Trauma Zero is a new horizontal scrolling shoot'em up under 
development by an Italian development team who believe that all in 
the Amiga community will love it. After the lost of Enigma which 
looked to be one of the best shoot'em ups for a long time in 1997, 
Trauma Zero could easily take it's place with the non-playable 
demo proving it to be a promising title. 

Trauma Zero is played in either Story mode, Arcade mode or Battle 
mode with you taking control of one of the three crafts (there is also 
a hidden one). It will have a simultaneous two player mode and 
contains a massive array of weapons (over 50 available such as 
Guns, Laser, Side-Shot, Plasma, Missile, Homing-Missile, etc) and 
it is full of enemies such as big end of level bosses, other enemies 
can be seen in the various screenshots. It will feature a real time 
animated background with 256 Colours at 25 Hz and have real time 
translucency effects like the fire of a missile or the background 
around an explosion. It'll include digitized Speech, awesome 
animation sequences, incredible graphics and tons of sprites on 
screen along with 1/4 Pixel scrolling. 

The developers of Trauma Zero hope to attend the Pianeta Amiga 
held in Empoli on the 26th and 27th of September to reveal more of 
the game.

GunBee F-99 Released
==============================================

GunBee F-99 is APC&TCP's latest game release, a cute manga 
style shoot'em up by Twin Eagles who are from Peru. GunBee 
F-99 is a traditional type shoot'em up, its story is about Lord 
Khenmir whose evil forces have invaded the peaceful planet of 
Valstyx kidnapping the Princess and stealing 5 Magic Crystals 
that provided power and stability to the whole planet. You take 
control of Kiara McGuire, the pilot of GunBee F-99 and go in 
search of the 5 Magic Crystals, to defeat Lord Khenmir's 
guardians and rescue the Princess from his evil clutches.

There are two modes from which to play in, Story mode which is 
very tough and Honey Mode which has been created to allow 
players to practise useful tactics and to learn the rules.  It seems 
pretty easy to get into with a number of weapons such as a 
Machine gun, Bombs, Firebeams at hand to clear your path of 
any of Lord Khenmir's guardians with these weapons being 
upgraded by collecting coloured bells. Throughout the five 
Japanese-comic style levels you must remember to watch out for 
the 5 Magic Crystals and in the face Lord Khenmir. GunBee F-99 
requires AGA, 4MB Fast Ram and Hard Drive space with it 
available from Islona (Epic Marketing) at the price of £7.99 UK 
Pounds.

New Moonbases Demo
==================================================================
A new demo of the Dune 2 clone Moonbases has been released. 
The original demo was released to a mixed responce a few months 
ago, since then, the developers, Homegrown Software have acted 
upon critisims and improved the game in a number of ways. 
Probably the biggest improvement has to be the addition of GFX 
card support. This was something that was requested by many 
when the first demo was released and since the game only catered 
for AGA then the developers saw this is something that had to be 
added. Using GFX cards, the gameis played in a nice 640x480 
resolution, I had a quick go of it and was quite impressed, it is very 
smooth and the game actually looks a lot better in a resolution like 
this.
This brings me onto the next major improvement that has been 
made, the graphics. Again, this was an area that received a fair 
amount of critisism when the original demo was released and 
again the authors have acted upon these and improved the game 
in this area. While, they still may not look as good as something 
like Napalm they are still better then the original ones. They are 
completly raytraced, the vehicles now look ok, however, I think the 
building gfx still let the game down a little....
In the demo you can play 2 single player missions, this gives a 
nice insight into what the game will be like. In the full game there 
will be 20 missions seperated into 2 seperate campaigns. There 
will also be the added feature of easy addition of extra missions. 
Other features of the full game includes in-game speech, 2-player 
link-up via serial cable or modem and lots more.
