                     ----------------------------------
for getting those pack working on maximum speed please install and always use
this  small  utility  named  "newwpa8".   it`s  patch  for  a  system routine
"writepixelarea  ()"  and  it makes the programs using this too much fastest.
copy  this  utlility  to your c:  drawer and put into startup-sequence before
"setpatch"  command.   plaese  compare  speed  results before and after using
newwpa8.

you  can  operate  this  pack with using of mouse and keyboard (no joy- stick
implemented  yet  =(.   how  to  select  a tune?  1) press "1"-"20" gagdet on
screen;  2)  use  keys [F1]-[F10] for tunes from 1 to 10 and keys "1"-"0" for
tunes  from  11  to  20.  change pages with pressing gadget, [cursor] keys on
keyboard  or touching the right/left corner of the screen with mouse pointer.
also  JUMP  thorught first and last page of any section by using [DELETE] and
[HELP].   quit  from  SDV (for sure?) by pressing "esc" from keyboard.  visit
your   workbench  screen  by  pressing  [ramiga]+[m].   change  screens  with
[alt]+[tab]  (for  all of alttab program users like me =).  what to say more?
find some other shortcuts and have fun.

              use 'newwpa8' before starting for maximum speed!
