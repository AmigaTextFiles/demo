»CL0:Yep, times up! issue 39 is the last EC
issue of the 90's!! Magical Moments
became a returning experience within
the EC during 1999. And I've been
supporting it for more than one year.
Of course not neglecting earlier years
when Static Bytes were making the EC.
(see issue 19 :) Maybe some of you
remember the famous KEN stories? Took
a long time to read because you had to
read a scroll text. Yes, once the EC
actually had a scroll text at the
bottom of the screen. (Hi Crusaders :)

»CL9:The Party vs The Party
»CL8:--------------------------------------

»CL0:Usually I could sum up some hot
productions being made for TP, 'our'
annual event. But this year I got in
some problems. Groups like Scoopex,
Nerve Axis DCS, Loveboat have
productions in progress, but not for
The Party I have been told, and Abyss
(hot at tp'98) is inactive (source:
Cyclone) Of course we have to see what
will happen at The Party 1999, but
this doesn't look good. TG'2000 and
MS'2000 seem more attractive? Maybe
alot of sceners want to spend the last
days of the old millennium at home and
don't want to travel for a long time?

From the other side of your screen I
want to wish you a merry Christmas and
a healthy 2000. Keep up the
productions in the new century! Amiga
4ever! (in our minds, through our
productions, on the net) I remember
when the clock went to 1990. Nice
demos and games. I was on the Amiga
scene for a small 2 years. And now
there are already 10 years behind me..

  (*)    The 90's it's all over
            I am Outta here!!   (*)
