»CL0:The first issue of Seenpoint was
released with quite some hassle back
in late September 1995. I immidiatly
contacted the unknown main-editor a
guy called 'Fishwave' and asked if my
new corner could be in issue two. He
refused. But I got his first interview
ever which got released in The Jungle
issue 8. And later also an article
written by me about Fishwave got
                        released in No
»PIC:EC39.128x128»                       Sense issue 2
                       and a HUGE
                       interview with
                       'Fissy' got
                       printed in
                       Generation
                       issue 23. Now
                       years later,
                       Seenpoint
                       tends to be
                       still alive.
                       In this
                       article you
                       can read the
                       current status
                       of the
                       magazine
                       Seenpoint!

»CL9:Pointing At Fishwave..
»CL8:--------------------------------------

»CL0:The ninth issue of Seenpoint got
released early 1999 and was a good
issue indeed. After this issue, the
staff announced a 10th issue shortly
after with some new work, and some of
the best articles of the previous
issues. There were even rumours that
after issue 10 Seenpoint would
continue as a online magazine. To
enforce the seenpoint staff Soda (from
Retro fame) joined Scoopex and thus
Seenpoint. Fishwave, Sane, Wade and
Soda. A good staff. So where is issue
10 exactly?



»CL8:Fishwave:
»CL9:"Soda was new yes.. But in fact, he
 has not written one single article
 (yet). Wade started with several ones
 but the major part is unfinished. The
 same for me. I have a dozen of
 articles - all unfinished." 
 
»CL1:Magic:
»CL0:"In the middle of 1999 Sane and Wade
 left the scene. Why? And does this
 mean the end of Seenpoint as we know
 it ?"







»CL8:Fishwave: 
»CL9:"Sane was the only active one, he
 completed several good articles.
 Since he was the only guy who worked,
 it hit him hardest to see the other
 three of us doing almost nothing.
 Thus he grew sick of it all being
 most disappointed about the
 'easy-going' Seenpoint project.
 That's why he left I suppose. BUT
 we're still in very good contact. You
 could say it is that he left the
 scene rather than Seenpoint."

»CL1:Magic:
»CL0:"The scene is waiting on Seenpoint.
 With less and less issues of diskmags
 being released, another issue of
 Seenpoint would be nice."

»CL8:Fishwave:
»CL9:"I know, but all on my mind is the
 girl I love right now. We're spending
 a lot of time together, and the rest
 is for work and sleep. I like the
 scene, and Seenpoint is my baby and I
 won't quit neither is it dead! But we
 are not the #1 anymore, we're just an
 excellent mag that will come out once
 per year. It is time for someone else
 to take over (I do not see anyone!)."

»CL0:The once so dominating Seenpoint has
fallen from it's throne. The eager has
floated from Fishwave's body.. By the
way, Fishwave, have you read the last
issue of the Eurocharts (#38) perhaps?
»CL8:Fishwave:
»CL9:"I haven't installed EC38 on my Amiga.
 I only got the chart results. The
 last time I used my Amiga was to
 check out the Gathering demos (and
 for the Scoopex intros that were
 released this year). I have got all
 the major releases on my HD, though.
 Will I ever get the time to look at
 them ?"
