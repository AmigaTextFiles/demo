»CL0: Since  the poems section in issue #36
 of the »CL1:Eurochart» I asked »CL1:Curt Cool» to
 re-open it as regular part,  but  due
 less  of time and support (except the
 poems   I   send   him    which    he
 unfortunately lost)  there  was  none
 since  three issues now and I thought
 I could edit one and send it to  »CL1:Curt»
 before  the  deadline. Because he was
 also  interested  to  read  some  new
 poems in EC I am looking forward that
 you are able  to  read  them  now  in
 issue #39!
 This time only some small, tiny poems
 but who said that only a long poem is
 a good poem? :-)

 But  before  I  forget  it:   I  need
 support   from   you.   Poems!   With
 comments by the author him/herself or
 a critic by someone else! Or a critic
 about  a  poem  by a well-known  poet
 like William Blake for example. But I
 prefer  personal poems made by you!!!
 Maybe about the Amiga?!
 Do what you can`t  leave  undone  and
 write me. Also critics about what you
 have  read  here  or  suggestions for 
 what you want to read. If I won`t get
 any support I will bomb you only with
 poems  of  mine and I guess you won`t
 survive this horrowshow! ;-)  Let  us
 make our grey  world  a  bit  colored
 with words. Our own words...
