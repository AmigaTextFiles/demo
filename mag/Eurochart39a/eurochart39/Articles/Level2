»CL0:I remenber L2 caches (Level 2 caches)
being introduced into the consumer
market with 386 PeeCees. While
Motorola packed their 020s and 030s
with cool internal caches, Intel just
released crappy 286 and 386 CPUs
uncached. Hence, clone makers had to
come with a solution to improve 386
speed and face the market.
Later, when 486 was introduced (which
finally had internal caches like in
68k), L2 caches were still used as
they were far larger than internal
ones and boosted speed strongly in
many tasks.

L2 caches are external caches that are
placed in the memory bus between the
CPU and the main memory. Their
function is the same as the ones I
described before, except that they are
physically seperated from the CPU and
they are unified caches; that is, they
cover every CPU access, no matter if
it's code or data.

Although Motorola supports external
caches correctly since 030, no
implementation were ever made on Amiga
(at least to my knowledge). »CL7:(Wrong,
AddSpeed for 68000 (!) give us 16kB of
L2... maybe someone still has it
somewhere... ;)  ... Troda)»

On Macintosh, it's usual to find L2
since the use of 040s. »CL7:(but even oldie
MacIIci has a L2 cahce slot (030&882)
and its performace is boosted very
rapidly when L2 is present... Troda)»

Those caches, although not as fast as
internal ones, are very important
accellerators of the computer. Think
about it: We had important speed
trouble with the rotozoom on 040/060,
as the texture was much larger than
the data cache. With a 256k L2 cache,
that problem would have been minimum.
Certainly, speed would have been
better in angle 0 than in angle 90,
but the difference wouldn't been that
extreme!
A nowadays L2 cache is 512/1024 KB
large.
»CL7:(not only that, 2048 KB are also
here... and if you read about BURST,
imagine speed-up, because the DIMMs
only need 60nS for first access, but
can burst later at 7nS, so just
imagine speed-up when L2 does every
acces in 7nS (even this first one) -
this is:
DRAMs (we have now)           
     - 1x 60 + 3x 60 = 240 nS one read
DIMMs (BoXeR will...)         
     - 1x 60 + 3x  7 =  81 nS one read
L2 cache (wanna be in BoXeR+) 
     - 1x  7 + 3x  7 =  28 nS one read
Don't wanna L2....? ... Troda)»

Measure the memory you are using for
any effect, you will realize it's not
much more. The chunky buffer, textures
and tables would probably fit into the
L2 cache easily doubling the speed of
the effect. »CL7:(sometimes even more, on
030 in MacIIci I sometimes got more
that 4x... Troda)
