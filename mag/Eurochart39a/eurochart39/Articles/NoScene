»CL0:The Name Is Nah-kolor, Magic of
Nah-kolor.. You see, the next century
is really around the corner now. We
have talked, thought, researched,
prayed, computed, scened, dreamed and
even written about the new milennium;
But there is no turning back now, it's
here! Only a few days left.. Actually
this countdown is nothing more than a
certain agreement started by some one
2000 years ago. The system called
Time, Day, Month and Year. Time &
DD/MM/YY (On your watch for example :)

The 90's decade is nostalgia soon.
What will become of the Amiga Scene in
the year 2000? What will become of the
EC, or maybe even more important ( :-)
-Cytron) what will become of Magical
Moments? Will I still be involved when
Iris will continue the EC when Depth
and Curt Cool hands over this 'darn'
chartsmagazine.. We (also Crusaders
and Static Bytes) all wait and wonder.

This time Magical Moments is a little
bit focused on the diskmagscene. To
honour what we all accomplished during
the 90's on the area of writing and
editing on the Amiga computer about
our Amiga Scene! But there is also a
nice little bonus; A really old skool
interview with Mahoney (from the
legendary coders duo Mahoney & Kaktus)
done by my good old friend Majic
Mushroom.. And of course the coverage
of Satellite'99. Other guest editor's
in this Magical Moments are Alvin of
Nah-kolor and the most popular pc
editor and/or writer these days: Adok
of Hugi. In which I have to confess
that it's not only 'Magical' moments
in this episode of my beloved corner
:) In addition Darkus who had a nerve
breakdown on the scene and was asked
to leave from Nah-kolor, rejoined the
scene and joined Haujobb in which he
will also do nothing (quote) But an
article was already given for this
Magical Moments corner so it was
included of course..

With 1 week of heaving the flue I
still managed to complete this corner
on time for issue 39.. With visiting
Poland the circle got completed. And
maybe it's time for the neverending
story to end (?) Well I am still here
are you next time?
