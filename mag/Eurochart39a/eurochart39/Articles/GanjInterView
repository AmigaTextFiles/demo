»CL9:»BIG:Interview with Ganja/Nerve Axis
»CL8:»SML:--------------------------------------

»CL0:ok .. . let's do an live interview,
mon ;)

»CL1:T:»CL0: tEiS
»CL7:G:»CL8: ganja

»CL1:T: »CL0:ok ganja, let our audience know who
   you are, name, age, hobbies,
   pipapoh

»CL7:G: »CL8: Alrighty, yo y'all! I'm Ganja -
   member of the UK based demo group
   Nerve Axis. Currenlty in my late
   20s and live in Finland. As you
   prolly guessed I'm a bit of a muso
   type of bloke so composing
   elektronik music is my main hobby.
   Of course there are other less
   interesting things but this is all
   YOU need to know ;)

»CL1:T: »CL0:{got that? ;)} ok ganja, you are a
   musician, as you told us. what
   style or music do you listen to at
   home, if you not make music for
   demos?

»CL7:G: »CL8:right.. I've always been in to
   dance music and almost everything
   the term covers. Nowadays I'm
   mostly into drum&bass and triphop
   as I kinda got bored with techno
   and all this 4/4-beat shit while it
   got so commercial. Another reason I
   like d&b and such is that it
   combines "live" stuff and
   electronic music very nicely and is
   still very much "danceable" so to
   say..

»CL1:T: »CL0:what do you mean, live stuff plus
   electronic music? like, jazz and
   electro?

»CL7:G: »CL8:yeah, like jazz and funk .. there
   are lots of elements from both in
   d&b and triphop nowadays - like,
   contrabasses etc. etc. You
   mentioned electro, but I can't say
   it would be of my taste. I'd move
   more to the direction of hiphop and
   house.

»CL1:T: »CL0:oh cool. so i suggest you listen
   yo jazz artists aswell. do you like
   Miles Davis?

»CL7:G: »CL8:heh, can't say 'cos I've heard so
   little from him, but I guess I
   would. Though all the music I like
   needs to have the beats you can
   dance to :).

»CL1:T: »CL0:so you mean you listen more to the
   beat elements in music. i suggets
   you would listen to all beat
   oriented music, like i.e country
   orintal music from africa or
   japan?.. they are beat depended.

»CL7:G: »CL8:err not quite. Firstly, I hate
   country more than anything... what
   I meant was that the beat needs to
   be there to make my head and feet
   move to it. The beat isn't the main
   factor at all.. more the melody &
   rest of the elements.. and jazzy
   sounds make me move.

»CL7:G: »CL8:like.. there are loads of cool
   jazz records out there but with a
   modern beat they'd be killers..

»CL1:T: »CL0:i understand. what do you think of
   the d&b actions in the amiga scene?
   are there any musician wich can
   compine jazz and d&b?

»CL7:G: »CL8:yeah there are few very talented
   d&b artists around. I just have to
   mention Substance cos he really
   knows how to combine the grooves
   and beats... as a matter of fact,
   he's the only one. The rest are a
   bit more stuck to the mainstream.

»CL1:T: »CL0:what is in your honest opinion the
   mainstream of amiga demo music?

»CL7:G: »CL8:nothing wrong with that.. there's
   always a mainstream and as long as
   it requires talent it's always
   good. I respect all talented scene
   musicians for their talents, not
   for the style. There's a big
   difference in the mainsteam pop
   music and scene music - always
   been. One thing though, people
   could imitate Muffler a bit less ;)

»CL1:T: »CL0:do you mean that there are alot of
   scene musician copying muffler's
   style?

»CL7:G: »CL8:yeah, at least trying to -
   especially the less talented ones.
   But that's purely my opinion and
   view.

»CL1:T: »CL0:well ok. but could it be that
   muffler wasn't the one who started
   that style? could it be that jazz
   of haujobb started all that. that
   electro, aphex twin alike style?

»CL7:G: »CL8:oh, I can't tell.. I've only
   heard two that kinda tracks from
   Jazz and about 30 from Muffler..
   and everyone else seems to think
   it's him as well.

»CL1:T: »CL0:ok. let's split back to the d&b
   subject. wich artists do you like
   the most and of wich to you get
   inspirated?

»CL7:G: »CL8:my absolute fav artists on that
   front are Red Snapper, Roni
   Size+reprazent, Grooverider, 4hero,
   almost everyone on Metalheadz,
   Moving Shadow and True Playaz label
   and finally DJ Misjah who isn't a
   d&b artist but more of techno..

»CL1:T: »CL0:yes i know dj misjah, a nice
   lady.

»CL7:G: »CL8:he's a man :)

»CL1:T: »CL0:oh yes, i meant dj djax ;)

»CL7:G: »CL8:from Holland, X-Track label - not
   Miss Djax ;)

»CL1:T: »CL0:;)

»CL7:G: »CL8:oh sorry, X-Trax label

»CL1:T: »CL0:ok

»CL1:T: »CL0:what do you think of the pc
   musicians and the amiga tracker
   wich merged to multichannel
   trackers, better known as pc
   trackers? are there talented
   artists and any good groups?

»CL7:G: »CL8:surely there are but I don't
   actually give a toss about what's
   going on in the pc scene and don't
   pay much attention to multichannel
   mods before I get myself a
   soundcard.

»CL1:T: »CL0:so you don't like that scene much?
   what do you think of music only
   groups on amiga?

»CL7:G: »CL8:nope, basicly I've no interest in
   the PC scene what so ever. About
   music groups, good question. When I
   used to do warez trading I disliked
   the idea of spreading modules in
   boards just like that as it was
   considered lame by most. I also
   disliked the some what over-cool
   attitude of these releases.. ie.
   using all kinds of slang words was
   in my opinion as stupid as typing
   the 3LiTE way.. anyway.. after
   some years passed and I stopped
   trading I kinda got more into it
   and started "accepting" these
   groups, though I still don't
   consider them as a very cool idea
   as they're trying too much to act
   like releasing "real" records. But
   heck, you just gotta go with the
   flow in the end..;)

»CL1:T: »CL0:so you mean people writing like
   this 'yo niggahz, dis d0uph tracks
   kicks arse, mon!... khou deff
   shiet... ' sucks?

»CL7:G: »CL8:well, basicly yeah.. I find it
   more of amusing nowadays.. simply
   cos european whites don't talk like
   that..

»CL1:T: »CL0:ahh, well. there are european
   blacks. maybe they included that
   slange? ;) anywyas. the idea of
   spreading mods only wasn't that
   good. what do you think of a music
   only group releasing musicdisc's
   and exe files only? like 4our does
   or plans to do?

»CL7:G: »CL8:oh, that then again is a lot
   better.. it's more of a scene
   release and there's more talent put
   into it. That's what I'd like to
   see more groups doing instead of
   just like.. throwing the mods
   "away" simply by releasing them to
   Aminet or some other archive where
   they'll disappear with thousands of
   other mods.

»CL1:T: »CL0:ahha... what do you think of
   little mod tunes, wich aren't
   bigger than 50 kilobytes and wich
   AREN'T any CHIPTUNES?

»CL7:G: »CL8:heh, they're cool.. I kinda
   started getting bored with chippies
   and now these tunes bring more
   change to releases and perhaps are
   even required badly. I couldn't
   quite want to hear a chip tune in
   some Scoopex intro as it simply
   wouldn't fit the atmosphere. I do
   have to admit that chips require
   more talent than these but that's
   not the point anymore it seems -
   more like, no matter how you do it
   as long as it looks and sounds cool
   :(

»CL1:T: »CL0:well, just imagine a mod tune, let
   it be d&b, with a size of 49900
   bytes. what do you think? you know
   that d&b is hard to do in such
   small size. all the beat samples
   etc. the most intro tracks are
   electric and have acid, bleep
   sounds wich you can resample often
   and wich don't sound bad. but just
   imagine a d&b mod with such small
   size. any good or is it even
   possible?

»CL7:G: »CL8:it's definitely possible! I've
   made several ones myself.. the
   other thing is if they're any good
   for intros, but it's certainly
   possible :).

»CL1:T: »CL0:ok good ;), what do you think of
   d&b in intros, demos etc. would it
   fit to some demo? .. the most
   intros have all this triphop alike
   style. i only saw ONE demo with
   jungle, that was a 3le demo
   'passengers'. what do you think?

»CL7:G: »CL8:I've seen at least 10 demos with
   d&b/jungle soundtrack and I think
   it has fit the demos pretty well,
   though is probably still not the
   best choice. Demo music needs to
   have impact and that's what
   drum&bass has. It can also have
   easily mellow and harsh parts. Hey,
   even our demo Pulse had drum&bass
   in it :).. You must have seen that?

»CL1:T: »CL0:nope, sorry ;). coool. what do you
   think about the music in discmags?
   i red an article that there are
   alot of tracks but that the most
   lack of quality. what do you think?
   should the diskmags authors collect
   more quality mods and different
   styles than just go for quantity
   and only collect funk, jazz
   oriented styles?

»CL7:G: »CL8:there certainly has been a bunch
   of shite mods in diskmags and if
   the offering is bigger than they
   can use each month I wonder why
   they pick the shitty ones. Maybe
   editors don't have any musical
   taste ;D... aaanyhow, they
   certainly shouldn't stick to just
   few styles especially if there are
   quality mods from lots of different
   genres available. I must say some
   mags have done this and I'm pretty
   happy with it too.
          »PIC:Malmis1.96x140»

















»CL1:T: »CL0:did you ever had a good d&b track
   in a mag?

»CL7:G: »CL8:hehe, yeah.. surely there have
   been some nice ones, but not too
   many I'd remember. Only one that
   comes to mind is from Substance..
   and well, I won't comment on my own
   mods - that's other people's job..

»CL1:T: »CL0:ok ;)... another question. what do
   you think of dark, hard, tech,
   twostep, jumpup jungle in the amiga
   scene?

»CL7:G: »CL8:basicly, categorizing music that
   much is very confusing and
   irrelevant. I'm happy with the term
   "drum&bass".. and same goes for the
   word "techno".

»CL1:T: »CL0:ahh. well, there are those styles.
   anyways, can you tell me some amiga
   musicians wich have the talent of
   making d&b, jungle music on amiga,
   in other words, with 4 channels?

»CL7:G: »CL8:to speak the truth only Substance
   and Dave will receive my mention as
   they're the only ones that have
   reached a high enough quality..
   Though Dave no longer uses an Amiga
   either, but in the past he did.
   Then there are some other Mono
   blokes who I can't remember by
   name, but I don't have many mods
   from them either. Then there are
   several wannabe's who lack
   originality or talent, but I won't
   say any names.. oh, I almost
   forgot Yolk&Legend..

»CL1:T: »CL0:well, i will mention some. what
   about mortimer twang, juice and
   muffler. are they good in making
   d&b music?

»CL7:G: »CL8:I can't say anything about
   Mortimer as I've not heard a single
   d&b tune from him. What comes to
   Juice and Muffler, I don't think
   they have the vibe.. again, I've
   only heard 2 d&b tracks from juice
   and non "real" ones from Muffler..

»CL1:T: »CL0:ok. do you think that there are
   some underground, unkown d&b
   musicians wich have talent?

»CL7:G: »CL8:you mean in the scene?

»CL1:T: »CL0:yes, in scene. amiga trackers
   ofcourse.

»CL7:G: »CL8:umm, heh.. surely there are but I
   don't want to mention Substance
   anymore ;D

»CL1:T: »CL0:substance isn't unkown. ok, some
   last few question. i guess this
   interview get's too long, or do you
   like to continue? ;)

»CL7:G: »CL8:oh you mean artists that are
   unknown to the scene.. well, no I
   don't know any good ones...
   
   anyway..

   it's your interview
   so it's your call :)

»CL1:T: »CL0:ok ;). what do you think of 4
   channel musicians making MODS wich
   sound real profesionell and wich
   are for professionell use like
   games or vinyl?

»CL7:G: »CL8:that's probably the goal of most
   musicians anyway.. at least it's
   mine. I wouldn't want this get
   stuck to the scene level. That's
   definitely a positive thing and if
   anyone's given a chance they
   certainly should go for it. Awfully
   many seem to quit the scene at the
   same time though.. I can't see any
   reason for that as it can't take
   that much time or anything..

»CL1:T: »CL0:well, maybe some of those trackers
   had enough of scene. about the
   time, no. there are musician wich
   have their own labels and still
   making music for the computer
   scene.

»CL1:T: »CL0:ok, we now had d&b music, jazz and
   funk. but the style wich wasn't
   done so much is hiphop. what do you
   think of hiphop? is there any
   musician or music in the amiga
   scene containig hiphop music?

»CL7:G: »CL8:yeah, I've actually seen a lot
   more hiphop in productions than
   D&B.. and to some it fits fine. I'm
   planning to do more hiphop in the
   future too...

»CL1:T: »CL0:yes? coool!... ok ganja. this was
   a looooong interview about d&b
   music and amiga music scene. thank
   you for your time and your interest
   in the interview. is ther one more
   thing you would like to say to the
   amiga nation and/or musicians
   before you can greet all your
   mates?

»CL7:G: »CL8:well, nothing much to say as I
   don't want to list about 50 names
   here :).. Respect to all the
   TALENTED ones - keep the scene
   running. And to all my "fans" (are
   there any? :)... I've got something
   for you all soon - be on a lookout!
   Cheers Teis, I'm out!

»CL1:T: »CL0:i have to thank you ;)... take
   care, keep cool and peace out..

»CL7:G: »CL8:righty.. can I close the window
   now?
