»CL4:           by Darkhawk/IRIS

»CL0:Another year is about to end, and
another installment of TP is about to
hit us. Actually I guess you're
reading this at TP or shortly
thereafter, and maybe I've even 
written a real (and probably quite 
rushed) TP report at that time, but 
this article is more about TP in 
general and I think it's going to have 
a "Why bother with that shit?" 
attitude, although the conclusion 
might not be that negative. Let's find 
out as we go..

»CL1:I'm one of the more loyal TP visitors
I guess, having been present at every
TP since 1992, only (narrowly I might
add, which still does frustrate me)
missing out on the first one. Now,
it's no secret that TP isnt what it
once was, but going deeply into why
this is so would probably be 
incredibly boring. Suffice it to say
that since around 1995, TP has not
been amazingly fun, and it has only
gotten worse from year to year. TP is
not about us anymore, it is not about
the Amiga anymore and it is absolutely
not about the C64 either. Most
parties, with the exception of the 
Symposium, try to get as many people
as possible to attend, no matter who
they are, and with such a huge event
as TP, that means thousands upon
thousands of people we would term as
lamers, in one way or another. I think
that the mainreason for TP being such
a bad party (not bad in organizing or
execution, but bad in aims and focus),
are the many gamers, leechers, lamers
outnumbering sceners on all platforms
by aprox. 50 to 1. It's not inspiring
or fun going from computer to
computer, watching what people do with
them anymore. You could spend the
entire TP meeting and chatting with
other sceners before, sharing your
interests, being creative, exchanging
the latest scenish gossip and
marvelling at the many productions at
the earlier TP's. Now it's hard to be
a scene nerd, although it is by no
means hard being a general nerd. When
walking around, you see porno
pictures on all Windows screens, you
see games, you see leeching, browsing 
                       and IRC
»PIC:Farty.128x117»                       chatting.
                       Thousands
                       of computers,
                       but not much
                       variety in
                       what happens
                       on them at
                       all. Now and
                       then, for
                       each 300
                       computers,
                       you might
                       also spot
                       an Amiga, hehe.



»CL0:The problem might be being an Amiga
user AND a scener. TP is a huge
"multimedia" event, being huge fun for
the average PC user wanting to leech
movies, porno, games, MP3's, etc..
Actually I do understand that, and
would like to bring my PCer instead,
hook up to the network and start
leeching and burning cd's like mad,
hehe. So, if focusing on these things,
TP is probably still a very great
party, although the entrancefee is
still incredibly steep. However, for
sceners wanting to meet other sceners,
competing and boozing with them,
having a good time, etc., TP is
getting worse year after year, exactly
because of the interests of the
average PC users, which, ofcourse, are
in a heavy majority. The organizers
can't REALLY be blamed for catering to
that audience I guess, and I'll give
them credit for keeping SOME scenish
aspects in TP, although they must have
forgotten their roots a long time ago.
The early TP's were quite a case of
sensory overload for a scener,
countless sceners walked around,
talking and having fun, dozens of
productions were released, evil
diskmag editors stalked everywhere,
looking for news and interviews, there
was so much going on. Now you quickly
locate your fellow sceners, and try to
have as much fun as possible. The
funfactor has shrunk along with the
scene and the productions being
released though. It's much more fun
being at a scene only party like
Symposium or (ahemm) SM. TP might have
a lot of features and burgereating
contests but that's not of any real
interest to me. 

»CL1:Apart from wishing I was an average PC
user and could enjoy TP by leeching
and playing, I must say that there're
still some positive aspects about TP.
The prices for the Amiga demo compo
are high, there's a C64 demo compo and
ehrmm.. Aslong as you bring with you
likeminded friends, it's still funny
in SOME way. The real question here is
whether it is ENOUGH fun to compensate
for the really lame things, the
atmosphere killing hordes of PC users
and the hefty entrancefee. I'm afraid
that it isn't in the long run, but
let's see what we all think about TP9 
when we have actually experienced it.
