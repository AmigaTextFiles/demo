 »CL0:It  came  as  something  of  a  shock to many people (myself included) when
 »CL1:Gateway» announced the end of the »CL1:Amiga MCC» dream and that they were pulling
 out  of  the multimedia computer market that »CL1:IBM» and other companies are so
 confident  will  exist  in  the near future.  But it is no coincidence that
 »CL1:Microsoft»  announced  that  it  intends  to  enter  the console market with
 something  called  the  »CL1:X-Box», and »CL1:Gateway» have now pledged to support this
 system.


 This  is  not the first article I have written on this subject, and chances
 are  it  will  not  be  the  last.   Games consoles are turning slowly into
 computers  again, just as happened in the early 80`s when the »CL1:Atari VCS» was
 finally  doomed  by  the  »CL1:Commodores»,  »CL1:Spectrums»  and »CL1:Amstrads» of the time.
 People  are  beginning  to  want  more.   When the »CL1:Amiga» dropped out of the
 market the »CL1:PC» tried to step in, but with its bulky operating system and its
 multimedia  unfriendly  design  it  was crammed into the »CL1:Amiga» market niche




















 rather than filling it nicely, leaving the games consoles to fill the gaps.
 Slowly  the  industry  is  waking  up  to  the fact that if »CL1:Sony» can sell a
 »CL1:Playstation»  for  under  £200,  it  won't be long before someone attaches a
 keyboard  and  modem  to  it.   The `multimedia` »CL1:PC» becomes a more and more
 unattractive  option,  »CL1:Sega»  have  already  launched  a  keyboard  for  the
 »CL1:Dreamcast»,  »CL1:Sony»  look  likely to follow suit with »CL1:Playstation 2», »CL1:Microsoft»
 must  surely  realise  that  the  »CL1:home PC»`s lifespan is looking shorter and
 shorter, hence its commitment to the new »CL1:X-box».


 But  where does this leave us?  Well it is sad but true that we will not be
 getting  our  new  »CL1:Amiga»  now, at  least  not from »CL1:Gateway», and it's highly
 unlikely  that  an  »CL1:Amiga»  made  by a small third party developer will ever
 become  a  mass  market  machine  in  the  same vein as the original »CL1:Amiga».
 However  we  may see a revival of the »CL1:Amiga» spirit when we finally get some
 inexpensive  home computers again.  »CL1:Playstation 2» looks more like the »CL1:Amiga
 MCC»  than  a  little,  and although »CL1:Sony» are not committed to bringing us a
 wealth  of  serious  applications  to  the machine, we may yet have the new
 »CL1:Amiga»  we  have  all been dreaming about.  Hard drives and Zips are planned
 for both »CL1:Playstation 2» and »CL1:Dreamcast», Imagine a revival of the old swapping




















days with sceners exchanging             »PIC:Cafe.128x174»
information on Zip disks between
powerful next generation
computer/consoles. Maybe 3 years from
now I will be writing about how much
fun the old »CL1:Amiga Scene» still is to a
group of new »CL1:`PSX-II`» sceners for the
»CL1:Official PSX-II Eurochart»? Well We`ll
have to wait and see...
