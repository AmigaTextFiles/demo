»CL0:Few months ago, just after the release
of EC issue 38, I got the opportunity
to interview Daniel Hammonds (22) from
the United Kingdom. Also known as Wade
of Nerve Axis and later on Scoopex.

»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"At the moment I'm mainly a writer for
 Seenpoint. I decided recently that
 this would be my main function for
 the scene with Amiga style graphics
 virtually dying."
»CL0:Sadly a few weeks after I asked Wade
my questions he left Scoopex and the
scene. Wade had his share of time on
the Amiga Scene residing in groups
like Eltech, Gods, Darkage, Nerve
Axis, Faction and Scoopex, and Wade
was of course part of the Seenpoint
Staff.

Wade's favorite wish would be
something that is quite dominating at
certain Amiga sceners. Though I do not
approve..







»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"I've always wanted to experience the
 effects of hallucinogenic drugs, so
 I`d probably drive out to the country
 side, settle down by a river and down
 some LSD or something. What I
 wouldn`t do is grab the closest girl
 and force her to have sex, which I
 think would be a popular choice among
 guys my age."

»CL9:Inside The 'Writer' Wade
»CL8:--------------------------------------

»CL0:The scener Wade started almost from
scratch with writing scenish articles.

»CL8:"My first attempts at article writing
 were in issue 10 of Deadlock (please
 don`t read them!). I felt it was a
 good way to take a dig at the scene
 and matters that annoyed me. Then I
 was given a chance to review some gfx
 for R.O.M. I found it really
 enjoyable and helpful in improving my
 real life language skills."
»CL0:Wade comments.

Though anno domini 1999 he's not
pleased how the magazines evolve
towards the new century.

»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"Writing today, there is this thing
 about advertising the Amiga and
 commercial rubbish. I`m sick of
 seeing it. I choose to read scene
 mags to catch up on SCENE matters,
 not some idealistic plans from a
 company with no money."
»CL0:Ironicly Wade's opinion about article
writing is the opposite compared to
Wolfman and Mount of Upstream fame
which I interviewed a couple of years
back.

»CL8:"I always loved the arrogant writers
 like Lord Helmet and now guys like
 Fishwave and Sane are continuing that
 trend. What is the point in free
 speech if no one is going to use it?"
»CL0:Wade comments.

But what about objectivity don't you
respect that?

»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"Yes I sure do, but that doesn`t mean
 sucking up to people. It means
 speaking the truth and commenting on
 what is there. It takes a certain
 degree of arrogance and self
 confidence to do this."

»CL0:Though Wade agreed with the statement
that writers can enhance the scene
also.

»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"Well, the reviewer can tell everyone
 what a demo is and how it looks, but
 most people have seen it already. The
 writer needs to give opinions, say
 what is good and what is bad about
 the subject they are looking at."





»CL0:Magic:
»CL1:"Choose: R.A.W. or R.O.M. ?!"

»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"R.A.W., but it would be a difficult
 choice."

»CL0:Magic:
»CL1:"Mop or Rokdazone ?!"

»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"Mop"
                         







»CL9:Wade's United Kingdom.. 
»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Being from England has it's
advantages. Wade already mastered the
English language what of course comes
in handy when being a Amiga Scene
Writer. But what about the Scene
over there? 

»CL8:"The U.K. scene was great before I got
 involved, but thanks to magazines
 like Grapevine it became a breeding
 ground for lamers. Nowadays it's
 basically Nerve Axis holding the
 national flag high."
»CL0:Wade comments and continues 
»CL8:"Nerve Axis work very tightly
 together, they know exactly what they
 want and set about doing it. When I
 joined I just wasn`t dedicated enough
 to help them in that way and felt
 somewhat like the group's handicap.
 After seeing my Noah pic among those
 stunning 3d effects in Relic I felt
 so embarrassed.."

»CL0:Wade's national patriotism isn't going
very far either. 
»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"I have to be honest, I really hate
 this country, the way it is run, the
 trends in attitude. It's not like its
 stereotypes. As for me, well I`m
 studying at the moment, including art
 and design and creative writing
 (novels, poetry and scripts). I hope
 someday to publish some work, but I
 know its a very difficult path."


»CL0:Magic:
»CL1:"Do you believe in God ?"

»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"I sure don`t believe in the God
 written about in the Bible. He`s too
 human. I believe more so in a non
 thinking creator, like the Sun for
 example."











»CL9:Epiloque
»CL8:--------------------------------------

»CL0:As I wrote earlier, few weeks after I
chatted with Wade on irc he left
Scoopex and the scene. These are his
very last words I suppose. (Untill his
comeback:)
Still I had to ask him how he sees the
future of 'Amiga Scening.'

»CL8:"Well, it's all pointing to the PC
 now. The Amiga is entering the
 difficult stage of Summer, when
 everyone discovers the wonders of
 real life. I honestly don`t expect
 many sceners to return come winter.
 However, a lot of PC sceners are very
 dedicated, they have to be
 considering how much they spend on
 their machines. And with Bill Gates
 behind them, it will never die. As
 for me, I`ll just continue with my
 020 until I can go no further."
»CL0:Wade comments.

And that time came quicker than he
anticipated :)

»CL0:Magic:
»CL1:"Choose: Spaceballs or Melon ?!"

»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"Melon, the new Spaceballs suck!"

»CL0:Magic: 
»CL1:"Anarchy or The Silents ?!"

»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"The Silents"
»CL0:Magic:
»CL1:"If you had 5 lines for the last words
 what would they be like ?"

»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"All things created are impermanent,
 strive on with awareness. Also the
 last words of The Buddha."

»CL0:Magic:
»CL1:"Any greetings or messages ?"

»CL7:Wade:
»CL8:"Not really, no one reads them anyway.
 :)"
