»CL4:           by Cytron/Depth

»CL0:Being one of the fools who has turned
his mind into more of an »CL1:MFC»
programmer's than the pure (and
extremely beautiful, compared to the
Intel's) »CL1:MC680x0» instructions, I've
not found the time to write articles
myself. We have, however, been so
fortunate to have received a long long
article from »CL1:Peskanov»/»CL1:Capsule» with
additional comments by »CL1:Troda»/»CL1:Pegas».
The article features everything, you
have ever wanted to know to get
familiar with the cache of the Amiga
processors. My knowledge of caches
were more or less up to date - but I
learned a lot of interesting aspects
by reading the article. To make the
article a little bit friendlier to
read - I've splitted it up. Further,
all comments from »CL1:Troda» (and me) are
in a very »CL7:discrete color», and all
coding examples have »CL4:their own color
»CL5:- as has their comments.
»CL0:Enjoy reading! And now, I'll give the
word to »CL1:Peskanov» himself:  

»CL8:Those nasty Cache issues 
»CL9:------------------------

»CL0:Hello there! This article will try to
show off some of the inner workings of
the Data & Code caches as defined by
the Harvard architecture, which is
used by the 68k and PPC CPU series
amongst many others. 

Don't panic! What I'm going to try to
explain is how the caches work, how
they affect your code and how to deal
with them when nescessary!
