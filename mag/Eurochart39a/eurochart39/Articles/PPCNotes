»CL8:»SML:--------------------------------------

»CL0:At the time of writing, the future of
the PPC is not very clear. »CL1:Phase5» say
that they are not going to develop new
boards until »CL1:AI» unveils »CL1:their» plans.
Also, development of »CL1:ppc.library» is
halted. The only developments going on
come from »CL1:H&P» on the software side,
and from »CL1:Escena» on Hardware.
»CL1:H&P» developed a software 68k emulator
some months ago. This opens the
posibility of PPC only accelerators,
without 68k. These boards would be
clearly cheaper and could carry L2
caches & DIMM memories (at the moment,
the only announced board that will
follow this scheme is Escena ZorroIII
dual G3 accelerator). »CL7:(Now things are
different, but we see what get
materialised... Troda)

»CL0:As far as I know, the 68k emulation
could support MMU emulation as well.
»CL7:(Update, supporting. At least this Sam
Jordan one. Full 040/FPU/MMU... Troda)»
It means that any cache/MMU hacking
you make could reflect on a PPC board
later - another reason to avoid
killing caches!! Surely some of you
think that all these warnings are
exagerated, but think about it this
way: 68k series haev been dead since
'94; there are still possibilities of
new amigas from several sources, and
all them are open to substitute 68k
with emulation. Also, all of them will
have faster memory and bigger caches.
It's worth noting that the H&P 68k
emulator is (still) not based on
dynamic compilation, but on a classic
interpretative emulation. This means
no problems or slow downs on ATC.
»CL7:(This will change soon... Troda)

»CL0:From »CL1:Capsule», we want to encourage
anybody that want to experiment with
complex algorithms and don't fear
learning new assemblers to go PPC and
support it. But take into account that
your 'investment' could have a short
life... Personally, I think any money
invested in amiga products is money
well spent, but I know that most
people can't afford that kind of
prices.
