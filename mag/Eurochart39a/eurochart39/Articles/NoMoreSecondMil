»CL1:"And while talking about the future,
this is also the section where the
editors traditionally look into the 
great big crystal ball to try to 
interpret the blurred images of the 
scene future... "»CL0: (from the editorial
of this issue of The Official
Eurochart - all the stuff about the
crystal ball was of course utter 
crap, still, the essence remains).

»CL9:Too many diskmags?
»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL0:The first questions we can ask
ourselves in 2000 is: Where have all
the diskmags gone? Only one
diskmagazine has been released 
recently, namely this very magazine -
and supposedly, all other
international diskmagazines are dead.
Yes, there are some left in Poland, in
Polish only, and yes, here in cold
Denmark we have the resurrected
"Dansktoppen" to be proud of.
If we compare the situation of 
the diskmagazine scene by the 
beginning of 1999 with that of the 
beginning of 2000, we see the death of
many legendary diskmagazines:

The former no. 1, Seenpoint, must be
regarded as dead - Sane and Wade have
left the scene, and according to
sources, Fishwave have lost all
interest in it. What happened to Soda?
We don't know. Rest In Peace.

No one have heard from the Insomnia
staff in a long time. The latest 
issue was released in September 1998 
which is more than one year ago by 
now. So, at least until another issue
is released, Rest In Peace.
The latest issue of Oepir Risti was
released at The Party 7, in 1997, so
their staff's policy of releasing one
issue a year is not working out.
Therefore, Rest In Peace, may you
raise again from your cold and shallow
grave.
Does Phoenix have a suitable name?
Everything has been quiet around the
staff and Giants since the promise of
issue #3, and the question is whether
this will ever see the light of day -
after all issue #2 was released in
October 1998, another delay over a
year - or just stay in the endless
darkness of Wiseguy's hard drive. Rest
in Peace, may yoy rise over your ashes
and fly high again.

The final issue of Retro was released
in January 1999. Soda left to join the
Seenpoint staff. No more Retro, no
more Seenpoint, no more Soda? Rest in
Peace, Retro.



In the beginning of 1999, the first
issue of a new diskmag, build on the 
ashes of Show/Scenetime, called "The 
Scene Press" was released by the
former main editor of Scene/Showtime,
Kaos Master which caused quite a stir
in Darkage, the group which used to
release Show/Scenetime. But now, Kaos
Master seem to be nowhere to be found,
so we regard "The Scene Press" as dead
and gone. Rest in Peace.

In 1999, the legendary editor
RokDaZone left the scene since his
Amiga was broken, combined with a lack
of motivation, and he was the compiler
of Generation. So now, Generation also
seems dead, the group which released
it is dead, so: Rest in Peace,
Generation. We notice with displeasure
that you were afraid of 28 as well.
And we thought we were the only ones
(hence the delay of the first
Eurochart issue by Depth, back in
1996).

A new project by Nah-Kolor, Devotion,
was never released due to the fact
that Darkus left the scene.

So, in 1999, over 60% of the
international diskmag population died:
Generation, Insomnia, Oepir Risti, 
Phoenix, Retro, Scenetime, Seenpoint, 
& The Scene Press - 8 diskmagazines,
out of 12. So we are now stuck with
this publication, Trashcan & Jurassic
Pack. Therefore, we salute Ghandy and
Modem's resurrection of Showtime - we
have even heard that a new issue may
be released at The Party. But then
what happens to Jurassic Pack and the
resurrection of DISC, in which Ghandy
is also heavily involved? The future
will, indeed, tell.

»CL9:Amiga Rules!
»CL8:--------------------------------------

»CL0:There is no doubt whatsoever that the
Amiga scene is getting smaller.
Talented people are leaving, and no
one are joining to replace them, since
the Amiga is not the computer to
attract new talent anymore.
Needless to say, this has got to stop
somewhere to keep the scene from
becoming non-existant.
Therefore we have to look in different
directions than the pc scene, which is
presumably in very fine shape (though
definitely not in oldschool scene
style, as far as I can tell). Look at
the c64 scene. It is still as alive as
it was 5 years ago when the Amiga
demos could still compete, or even
beat the pc demos by several miles.
So now the question is: Is the Amiga
as cool as the c64? Is the Amiga as
cult as the c64?
The Commodore 64 computer is a part of
the general cultural inheritance of
our generation. I dare say that
everyone in Western Europe at the age
of 20-30 owned or used to know someone 
who owned a c64, if only play games 
on, in their childhood and early 
youth. And the c64 was unchanged 
through its 10 years of glory.

Compared to the Amiga, especially the 
Amiga 500 was a very successful
machine, but still, its glory years
was from 1987-1992, five years, and in
1992, the pc took the lead as a home
computer, where the Amiga 1200
essentially failed. Therefore, not as
many people got to know the Amiga in
the first place as the c64, which
obviously makes things look a bit
black for the Amiga scene, since it's
very important for a computer scene
that the machine it works on is
widespread.




Still, there are redeeming points:
* Today, the Amiga is still useful for
all modern applications - which means,
basically, the internet. Therefore, 
the Amiga users don't have an actual 
need to buy a pc or a mac instead of
the Amiga (that most Amiga sceners DO
own a pc, that's another story). This
is not the case for the c64 (on the
net with a 1Mhz C64 - I think not!).
Also, the Amiga community is very
fanatical towards their machine -
still, this is only a good point until
something common is suddenly not able
to run on the Amiga.
* The Amiga is generally regarded as a
scene computer. The Amiga demoscene 
is the classic scene, essentially the
first of its kind since the c64 scene
was very much connected with the
illegal scene in its early days.
Just check, there are enormous amounts
of releases from 1987-1999.

So let's see what we can do to keep
our scene alive. Releases is good.
Many releases is better. Good releases
is the best.


»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL9:Fuck the legends!
»CL8:--------------------------------------

»CL0:The Amiga scene today is old, and
everybody tend to compare themselves
to various legends, of which most have
already left the scene. This is of
course something which is bound to
happen as the scene has become older.
Surely, one can learn from the
abilities of these legends, but there
is no reason why becoming even better
than these so-called legends should
not be possible. The morale is:
One can learn from their work, but
what's the reason for comparing
oneself with someone who are
essentially dead and gone for our
scene?


»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL9:No More Vectors!
»CL8:--------------------------------------

»CL0:I and others have written plenty of
articles about the bore of another c2p
vector-engine, another bumpmap,
another tunnel, but I am afraid there
is nothing we can do. Hopefully the
future scene will be able to come up
with new ideas, new design,
essentially new ways of doing things.
Or has everything been done before, as
some people say it has in the real
world? Anyway, I will not bore you
with another article of this kind.


»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL9:Doublemembership sucks!
The Internet ruins the scene!
»CL8:--------------------------------------

»CL0:Etc. etc. Nope, that's not the case.
The internet makes it possible for
more people whose groups are inactive
or dead to get in contact with other
people, and perhaps join their groups
instead or too, the internet makes it
possible for talented, motivated
people to put their talent and
motivation to use in other people's
productions as well, and join as
double- triple- quadriplemembers.
The internet improves the friendship
in the scene because it helps people
who lives far from eachother to
communicate.
It also works as a brilliantly
effective distribution media, to which
annoying, violent, FAT postmen and 
arrogant sysops have no influence.

Conclusion: The internet and double
membership means more productions, and
this will also be the case in the
future, as even more people use the
net to its full potential. The
prospects for spreading productions
and telling people about the Amiga and
the Amiga scene have never been
better.

»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL9:The Amiga is DEAD!
(as a commercial platform in
development)
»CL8:--------------------------------------

»CL0:It is. There's no denying it. After
the demise of the Gateway project to
make a new machine, no one has taken
over. I have heard about a new OS
which will support full Amiga
emulation using PPC processors, and
that is the best bet for an Amiga
future. It even looks like AmigaOS
just better.
But after all, looking back: Wasn't
the Amiga dead by the demise of
Commodore?


»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL9:The future!
»CL8:--------------------------------------

»CL0:So the future of the Amiga scene still
looks like this: The scene will become
smaller, 2000 will see the rise and
fall of various groups - will Scoopex
be able to maintain their leading
position, is it true that
Schlott/Nerve Axis will quit after The
Party 9? The next year will tell, and
you will surely be able to see what
happens right here in the Official
Eurochart. We will see more and more
design in demos, since it's becoming 
harder and harder to take our ancient
hardware even further. Hopefully some
other changes will happen (I myself am
tired of Muffler-style music and
flashes and jumping screens).

So, to all of you readers: A happy new
scenish millenium. May you all stay
creative and happy sceners.
