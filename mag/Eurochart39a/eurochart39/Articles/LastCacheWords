»CL0:Re-reading the article, I see I have
left out many things still to be
explained. And many others remain
badly explained... But well, nobody is
perfect, and at least I hope this
article will help some people to make
their code more stable, and maybe will
introduce some others to this
important matter.
If I think too much important
corrections are needed, I will release
a second revision of this article.
Feel free to send any corrections or
sugestions you think of interest.

when I X times asking, I did it...
Troda)» I left this collection of title
as reference. If you want to get
really into the theme, get some of
them:
