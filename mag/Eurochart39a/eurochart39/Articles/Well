»CL9: "You Might See Things" »CL7:-»CL8: a tiny piece
 of  rhyme-art  I  found  in  an older
 intro by Dragnet, a 40kb  one.  Well,
 you  may  quarrel  with  me about its
 contents because I think  some  lines
 are senseless but therefore it`s nice
 to read and can make you laugh a  bit
 but  even  the unknown author himself
 didn`t claim to be a  good  poet.  At
 least it is the only one I found that
 has directly something to do with the
 Amiga!



»CL9: "Flyin`"»CL7: -»CL8: a small  but  really  ass-
 kicking one by my oldest  friend!  It
 contains  so many thoughts and truths
 in so few words. When I read it in my
 deepest depressions I always  felt  a
 bit   better  thinking  that  nothing
 really counts. Neither in  this  life
 nor  in  the  one  afterwards... I am
 often  wondering  about   the  things
 happened  to me, made happen by me...
 When I read it my  mood  gets  better
 and I do not care  anymore!  What  is
 done is done!
 Some day I asked Ed to explain it. He
 just asked back:
 "Do you find that it`s good to read?"
 I said "Yes!"
 "Does it make you think about?"
 I said "Yes!"
 "That`s it!" he closed.
 "But  didn`t  you want to say us, the
 readers, something with it?" I asked.
 "Just done it!" he replied.



»CL9: "nowadays" »CL7:-»CL8: one by  myself  done  in
 january 1998. This time I was dissap-
 pointed  by  the  men and women I was
 living with side by side,  so I wrote
 these small lines.
 Everybody says that it is good if men
 cry  but  when  then  a man starts to
 they all laugh about him or at  least
 don`t  want  to  know him. Especially
 girls say they want  a  sensible  man
 but if you show them your sensibility
 they always say:  I like you, but let
 us stay friends! Okay? I hope you are
 not angry...
 HUUUURAAAA!!! I was that angry... Too
 often! Same way with  the  girls.  In
 the  past  men knew why they let them
 burn  entitled  as  witches.  Because
 they are witches.  Show me a girl who
 is not lieing or haven`t ever lied. I
 will  give  you directly... Let`s say
 thou...okay, hundred dollar!  You see
 I am hoping! Still today... But isn`t
 sex all at last???
