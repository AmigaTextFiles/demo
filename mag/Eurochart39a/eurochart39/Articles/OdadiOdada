»CL8:»SML:---------------------------------------------------------------------------

»CL0:The  crazy  Japanese  do it again, Pokemon (known as Pocket Monsters in its
native  Japan)  finally  arrived  in  the  UK,  personally I`d been looking
forward  to  a  new Zelda type game and so I bought it, and now I`m hooked.
Short  of  any  decent editorial content from me this issue I bring you the
lyrics  to  the  English and Japanese Pokemon cartoon songs!  Ahem, well at
the  time  the  Japanese  translation amused me, and I thought it may amuse
you.

»CL8:I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was. 
To catch them is my real test, to train them is my cause... 
I will travel across the land, searching far and wide, 
These Pokémon to understand, the power that's inside. 
Pokémon...gotta catch 'em all!! 
It's you and me... 
I know it's my destiny 
Pokémon...Oh..you're my best friend, 
in a world we must defend. 
Pokémon...gotta catch 'em all!! 
A heart so true--our courage will pull us through! 
You teach me and I'll teach you! 
Pokémon! 
Gotta Catch 'Em All! 
Gotta Catch 'Em All! 
POKE-Ke-MON!

»CL8:I'll go through flames,floods, weeds, forests, 
The soil, clouds, and under the skirt of the girl (Scream!) 
And through here, through there.. 
And through here, through there.. 
A long, long road to go.. 
To get pocket monsters.... 
Good-by, my home.... 
I'm starting with the cute guy (Pikachu!) 
Win and win with a trained ability, 
Go to a new town with new friends 
Success is not guaranteed 
(A matter of course) 
What's the matter? 
You, monsters, always go all out 
I'll go through flames, flood, weeds, forests 
The soil, clouds, and under the skirt of the girl (Forget it!) 
And through here, through there 
And through here, through there 




















A long, long road to go 
To get pocket monsters 
Tired, I say good night 
I Close my eyes and am reminded (Pikachu?) 
That through fanned flames and a storm, 
Hearing you, monsters, 
I battled. 
Old days they said Yesterday's enemy is today's ally 
But today's ally is an aeon ally, 
I wanna be a great pocket-monster trainer!.. 
..I should be! 
I heard someone telling the dreams come true with the sound of music, 
...A bud would bloom.. 
...I would see my dream be true.....


»CL0:And remember, girls like this game so it can`t be that bad :)
