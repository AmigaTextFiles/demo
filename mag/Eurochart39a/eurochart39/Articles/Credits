»CL8:»SML:--------------------------------------

»CL0:This time, the credits are very
boring. In fact, the credits are
usually very boring, except if you are
one of the people who are actually in
the credits. They're boring no matter
if the person who wrote it really
pulled himself together and tried to
make the credits funny. Anyway, here
they follow:

Magazine code by »CL9:Quedax», additional
code by »CL9:Cytron».

Magazine graphics by »CL9:Judas»/»CL9:IRIS», title
picture by »CL9:Hardfire»/»CL9:Spaceballs».

Clip-Art by »CL9:Malmis»/Independent,
»CL9:Cytron» & »CL9:Curt Cool».

Music by »CL9:Zandax»/»CL9:Damage», »CL9:Qwan»/»CL9:Up Rough»,
»CL9:Curt Cool»/»CL9:Depth» and »CL9:Hardfire»/
»CL9:Spaceballs».

What the main-editors did was:
»CL9:Curt Cool» did the gallery section,
collected support, counted votes and
wrote an article or two.
»CL9:Cytron» assembled it all and layouted
all the articles, and »CL9:Darkhawk» wrote a
lot of articles and collected some
support.

What the co-editors did was:
»CL9:Magic»/»CL9:Nah-Kolor» once again strikes
with his »CL8:Magical Moments» section,
which also features contributions from

»CL9:Darkus»/»CL9:Haujobb» and »CL9:Alvin»/»CL9:Nah-Kolor».
»CL9:MJ»/»CL9:IRIS» edited the news and adverts,
and »CL9:Bucko»/»CL9:Depth» came up with a few
articles in the last moment.

Starring as this issues guest writers,
»CL9:Zito»/»CL9:Apathy», »CL9:Peskanov»/»CL9:Capsule»,
»CL9:Troda»/»CL9:Pegas», »CL9:Coma»/»CL9:Absurd»&»CL9:Apathy», »CL9:Teis»/»CL9:
Spaceballs»&»CL9:Mawi» and »CL9:Carp»/ex. scener 
did a wonderful job.

Once again, our eternal thanks must go
to everyone who supported us with
votes, gallery photographs, general
information etc. etc. We love you all,
and we hope that you enjoy this
production, because it's made for YOU!
