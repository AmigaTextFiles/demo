When  reading  Jurassic  Pack 13, you get the feeling
that half of the articles are typed one year ago, and
the  other  half is fixed right before the release of
Jurassic  Pack.  Huh, old articles you may think. But
lets  turn  it  around.  If  old articles wouldn't be
included,  and  deleted  instead,  parts of the scene
would  be  lost  forever.   So it's better to include
them.  We  have  an  important responsibility for the
scene  future to document the story of Amiga!
