                             A wet sun shines down
                          sod it it's raining all over
                        the pools are empty thus filled
                  with a thousand tears for a vanished summer.

                        The water in my eyes isn't salty
                        it is also a child of the clouds
                    clouds that are familiar to me on a sky
                    under which I faced 20 summers of tears.

                           Flags are blowing far off
                  and I wished I could follow their direction
                    to lands with a lucky sun on a lucky sky
                     and children that face summers of dry.

                               Still I am moving
                         with the clouds not the flags
                     and again face I the lake of my youth
                       filled with twenty thousand tears.

                      Wandering through the rain watching
                                   grey field
                                    grey sky
                                   grey trees
                                  grey water.

                          Standing still at the bridge
             crossing the river bringing warm waters into the lake
                           and looking at the scenary
              I see a fish coming from the depths to consciouness.

                     For moments he playfully toils around
                         before getting out of my sight
                  trying to follow his directions with my eyes
                   I see a bird on the mirror of the surface.

                     As I try to follow the birds direction
                         I see my surrounding as it is
                        a peaceful oasis within the rain
                             of a forgotten summer.

                           I can touch the wet trees
                  and the freshness of the air fills my lungs
                       in the serenity I hear a bird sing
                    and the full green living fills my soul.

                            Twenty forgotten summers
                 summers of empty but filled pools I faced here
                  unknowingly that this is the place I belong
                this is the country I was born, this is my home.
