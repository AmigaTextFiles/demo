As  the  young  girl looked out of  the window, she saw the snow falling down on
the  streets,  covering  the trees and the ground until the whole scenary looked
like a old dirty sheet.  She wondered that somehow...  it looked like dust!  She
asked herself what would happen if her room would be filled with dust so high as
the  snow in this bitter winter.  She giggled, imagining the shocked face of her
mum.

Her thoughts moved.

Milliards  of  small flakes came down and her fantasy told her that this was not
snow  she was watching but dust.  Every single flake coming down, falling to the
ground  to  cover it was one single particle of dust to her, zoomed by her plain
eyes.   She  was  a scientist, yes, that's what she was.  She studied the flakes
and copied what she saw to her room in mind and combined and compared.

She kept watching the snow playing, dancing in the wind.  She saw other children
playing  out  there  in the white.  Normally she would have ran out to play too,
letting  herself fall into the snow, feeling the coolness turning to water as it
hits  her  heated  red  skin.   Funny clouds in front of her mouth where her hot
breath  cristalises.   But  this  was  nothing  she knew about, all she saw were
flakes so much alike dust - still so different.

Most people like snow but dust is the cause of much evil.

People  have  to  clean  their rooms because of the dust (a duty our little girl
annoys quite a lot).
People react allergic on it and have to swallow expensive medicaments, including
corticoids.
It's the waste of the world, rubbish, nothing, less worth than the...  yes, than
the dust underneath our feet.

The  spinned forth her thoughts.  Snow is cold and it is wet.  Dust is of normal
temperature  and  it  ain't wet.  Would people think the way they do if it would
snow  all  day  in  their  room  and  if dust would only fall in winter, playing
virtually  in  the  wind?   Maybe  it would be enough if snow wouldn't disappear
after a snap but the dust?

She turned her head to the cupboard.  Walking over and and making a dot with her
fingertip  on  the  bottom  shelf was one action.  She looked at the small round
circle  in  the  dust  on  the  surface of the old wood where her finger hit the
shelf.   She  looked  at her finger.  Considering.  Slowly her hand moved again.
Becoming  faster  while  the  time  stepped  forth, she painted something like a
abstract  pig  into  the  dust  on  the shelf and giggled.  Than she watched her
finger  again.   Watched  the  thin  skin  of  dust.   Wondering  about the grey
gentleness.

Suddenly  she  took  her  finger  to  her mouth and blew.  Blew off the dust and
laughing danced with the dust falling down, dancing in the wind of her movement.
