2                          by Merlyn of The Magic Guild


A  thick  layer  of  dust covered the ancient scrolls laying on top of the large
bookshelf.
The  owl  Archimedes  sneezed  and  mumbled oaths and dire threats as he waddled
through the swirling dustclouds.
"Why does he want these?", Archimedes mused irritably.
"They've  lain  here  in peace for over a century, but of course, now's the time
for reminiscences and maudlin thoughts!"
"Damn  and  blast!!  Why did the doddering old fool come up with this scheme all
of a sudden!"
Savagely  grabbing  a  brittle,  old  scroll  in  his  talon,  Archimedes peered
balefully at the encircling band.
"Yes, this is the one.  Small mercies!", he muttered as he blinked myopically in
the sudden sharp light and promptly sneezed violently again.

"How's it going? Any luck?"
The  old  wizard  held  a lantern aloft and peered up at the whirling dustclouds
threatening to engulf him.
A  huge  dustball swooped down from up yonder and dropped an age-yellowed scroll
uncermonically down on Merlyn's charred workbench.
Not  bothering  to  answer, Archimedes ruffled his feathers and left a tiny dust
storm behind as he flew out of the Crystal Cave.

Waving ineffectually at the flying dust, the ancient half-elf grabbed the scroll
and retreated eagerly to his large dewlap chair.
Stuffing  his  large  claypipe with aromatic tobacco and setting it literally on
fire, Merlyn settled back contently, smacking on his pipe.
Unrolling  the  brittle  scroll,  he  was soon emerged in a deep cloud of smoke,
carefully scanning the arcane symbols relating the last years in the life of his
ancestor; Gorm VallenWood.

Hours later Archimedes re-emerged in the wizard's study.
Alightening  on  the back of Merlyn's chair, the owl peered suspiciously down at
the smokecloud laying below him.
So  the  old man had finally got hold of something to tickle his imagination.  A
self-satisfied snicker rumbled deep down in the owl's chest.
Despite  all  his misgivings & critical views on his mentor's magical practises,
Archimedes still held the old mage in high regard.

"Ravenhaired, highbreasted beauties..."
Skipping to the end of the scroll, Merlyn read the postscript with bemused eyes;
"Thus ends a brief summary of my travels in the Southern Plains.

 Laying down my quill for now.

 Gorm VallenWood."

The  old  wizard  let  the scroll drop into his lap & puffed meditatively on his
claypipe.
So,  his  illustrious ancestor wasn't only an ArchMage & SpellMaster.  He'd been
an avid womanizer, too!
Who'd imagined .....

A sudden thought flashed through the lurid images crowding Merlyn's mind.
Women, kids!
What if he had relatives in the Southern Plains!!?
Rapidly calculating on his fingers, the wizard suddenly sat bolt upright!  Every
fifth  generation  in  an  ArchMage's  linage  had  usually one or two children,
magically bestowed.
While every tenth generation blossomed magical powers of a vast magnitude!
If carefully nurtured the abilities could bloom to archmagical propotions.
According  to  Merlyn's  calculations Gorm's eventual offspring was in the tenth
generation now!
Springing to his feet, the half-elven mage shouted for his pet-owl!

Sitting  scant  feet  away, Archimedes toppled backwards, blinking his huge eyes
furiously.
Crawling  back  up  on the dewlap chair's tall back, the owl swore majestically,
while  trying  to  restore  his hearing by knocking his head repeatedly with his
talons.
Not a mean feat actually, as he was valiently trying to climb at the same time!

"Get my scrying ball, Archimedes & I'll hunt for the proper spell-book", tagging
up his oversized frock, Merlyn shuffled excitedly towards his library.

Hours  later  the  old half-elf was still crouching over his large scrying ball,
mumbling intricate spells & formulaes.
Shimmering  images  &  blotches  of  colour  undulated  to  &  fro in the ball's
interior, constantly changing & shifting.

Suddenly  a  clear picture crystallized, depicting a tall, darkhaired man with a
magnificent blueblack beard.
The  man  was  dressed  in  a  costume  of  outlandish  design,  but nonetheless
recognizeable as a wizard's outfit.

"Eureka!", cried Merlyn excitedly.

A  medallion  dangling  around  the  mage  in  the  ball's  neck caught Merlyn's
attention & stopped further exclamations of glee.
Squinting fiercely to try & see the motif of the medallion, Merlyn's eyes fairly
bored into the image in the scrying ball.

Slumping  back  in  his  chair, the resident of the Crystal Cave rubbed his eyes
irritably.
"Archimedes,  me sweet.  Could U please shift Ur rump over here & help me out?",
Merlyn shouted.

Lowering his patchment (a forerunner of modern days newspapers) wearily, the owl
waddled over to the scrying ball.
Prudently  donning one of Merlyn's cast-off wizardly hats, Archimedes pulled the
hat cautiously well down over his ears, to protect them from further abuse.
Blinking his huge, amber eyes & spitting contemptiously Archimedes looked archly
at the image in the scrying ball.
Human eyes, my ass!
Elven  eyes were fair, to be admitted, but even a half-elf's eyes were hardly up
to the task of close, enlonged scrutinies!

Could it be?!!
Looking more closely at the image, the owl was suddenly struck by the improbable
truth!
The medallion's motif was in truth the family ensign of the PenDragons!

Merlyn's  obscure  birth  &  upbringing  had  nonetheless  proven  to be closely
connected to the Royal Blood currently ruling in the M'Yiomoza Lands.
Namely the PenDragons!

None  other  than  blood  relatives of the PenDragon Clan could wear the magical
medallions & live!
Knowing  the  potent  powers of the PenDragon medallions, Archimedes realised he
was actually looking at a relative of Merlyn's!!!


Who's this mysterious stranger from a far land?


Lightning  flashed  &  deep  thunderclaps  rolled  & echoed in the vast MoonMist
Mountains.
Small  avalanches  skimmed down the steep mountainsides, causing minor damage to
small trees & bushes.

A  huge  owl  glided on broad wings amidst the black clouds, evidently searching
for a specific spot to land.

Spying  a narrow ledge on the precipitous mountainside, the owl landed & waddled
into a dark, narrow cave.
Moments  later  it  scurried  frantically out, threw itself desperately from the
ledge & dived like a stone towards the nether regions of the mountain-side!
Lifting  its proud head & sniffing eagerly a large snow-leopard emerged from the
selfsame cave scant moments after the owl.


In  the  Crystal  Cave,  the  ancient wizard shook his head in disgust.  Looking
deeply  into his crystal ball, Merlyn closely followed the antics of his pet-owl
Archimedes.
"Damn  &  blast,  the  bloody  bird!", he exclaimed, "why can't he use his over-
rated senses for once & finish his quest!"



Deeply  shaken,  Archimedes  thought  equally  dark  thoughts about his Master &
Mentor!
Why couldn't the old sod go looking for the Seer himself!
The owl didn't give two hoots about the mysterious Auguerer!
His  main  ambition  in  life  was to sit tucked up on top of his favorite book-
shelf,  reading  the more lewdly scrolls he'd discovered while searching for the
blasted scroll, telling the tale about Merlyn's forefather; Gorm Vallenwood!

The faint smell of burning wood, snapped Archimedes out of his reveries!
Hallo, what's this?  Had he inadvertedly stumbled on the lair of the fabled Grey
Walker?
Gliding  noiselessly  over  a  tall  mountaintop,  Archimedes scanned the under-
laying terrain eagerly.
There! A waferthin spiral of bluish smoke!
Flying lower, the owl soon detected a cave-opening in the mountainside.

Landing  akwardly  in  the  deep  snow,  Archimedes waddled up to the forbidding
opening.
Hastily  cramming  a  small  arsenal  of snowballs, Archimedes looked around him
suspiciously.  Swallowing nervously, he called out in a small voice.
"Hello! Anybody home?"

An  unnatural  silence  settled  over the mountainside.  Even the thunderclaps &
howling winds stilled.
Ruffling his feathers & gripping a snowball tightly, the owl waited.


Clamping  his  clay-pipe  tightly between his teeth, Merlyn stared intently into
his crystal ball.


"Welcome, feathered friend!"
Archimedes shrivelled down to a tight featherball at the sound!
A indistinct shimmering image emerged from the dark cave!
Despite his sudden terror, Archimedes blinked his eyes & stared wide-eyed at the
ghostly form undulating before him.
He  was actually looking at The Grey Walker!  The hermit said to be the greatest
wizard & auguerer in all of the M'Yiomoza Lands!

Swallowing  the  sudden  lump  in  his  throat,  Archimedes  held out the scroll
bestowed on him by Merlyn.
Taking  the  brittle  scroll  from  Archimedes'  talon, The Grey Walker turned &
disappeared back into the dark mountain.

Hours later, the hermit's shadow once more emerged.
Looking fondly down at the small igloo sitting beside the cave's mouth, The Grey
Walker  bowed  down  &  placed a small pouch before the igloo's enterance before
vanishing back inside his beloved mountain.

Late  that  night  Archimedes  stumbled  bleary-eyed out of his little bodoire &
dangling his talons in the pouch-strings, fell flat on his beak!
Coming  slowly  to  his  senses,  the  owl  picked  up  the  obstacle  &  peered
incomprehensively  at the snowcovered bundle.  Slowly its significance dawned on
him.
This was The Grey Walker's solution to Merlyn's problem!

Taking  a  firm  grip on the pouch, Archimedes launched himself up into the cold
nightair & set course for the far-off Crystal Cave.


Exhausted  by  his  vigilance, Merlyn finally fell literally asleep & was rudely
awakened by crashing his forehead into the crystal ball!
Rubbing  his  weary  eyes  &  sore  head, he squinted into the nightsceen in the
scrying ball.
Assaulted by a sudden attack of vertigo, he stared down at the moonlit landscape
rushed by, far beneath him!
Archimedes must be on his way back!


Hours elapsed before his faithful, feathery friend swooped into The Crystal Cave
once more.
Crashlanding  in  Merlyn's  dewlap  chair, Archimedes left the gruelling task of
freeing  the  pouch  from  razorsharp  talons  to Merlyn & fell promptly asleep,
snoring contently.

Frantically bending & twisting the talons hither & thither, the old mage finally
managed to rescue the pouch from Archimedes' deadly grip.

Pulling  the  pouch  open,  Merlyn  spilled  its  contents  out  on  his scarred
workbench.
The scroll & a small parchment rolled out.
Picking up the parchment, Merlyn reverently smoothed it out & began to read.

"Noble Merlyn!
 I am honoured to once again be of humble assistance to the Leader of The
 Magic Guild.

 Ur honourable quest may bear fruits, with this little assistance.
 The name U seek is ZULKIR MALIGOR, a wizard living in the Southern Realms.
 He's a direct descendant of my friend of elder days; Gorm Vallenwood &
 thus seemingly hitherto unknown relative to the Pendragon Clan.

 May the Deities guide U in Ur forthcoming quest!


 Ur humble servant
                   The Grey Walker
                                                                          "

Lowering  the  patchment, Merlyn stared unseeingly into the flickering flames in
the fireplace.
So he was right, after all!

Bemused he re-read the letter once more. "Ur humble servant", indeed.
The Grey Walker was certainly no man's servant! 
Looking  at  the  snoring  owl,  Merlyn  once  more marvelled at the endurance &
courage inhabiting Archimedes' mind.
The  Grey  Walker,  being  a  Druid  first  &  foremost,  would have no contacts
whatsoever  with  humans, elves, dwarves or other beings, apart from his beloved
animals, birds & plants.

Thankfully  the  ancient half-elf tucked a pillow under Archimedes' head, before
retiring to his sleeping quarters.

As  sleep  crept  up  on  him,  his last concious thoughts were on a tall, dark-
haired man wearing the medallion of the Pendragon Clan!
