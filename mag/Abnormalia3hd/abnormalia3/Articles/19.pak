  2                         By The Ripper of Nightfall


It  was  hot.   Hot  like  hell,  if hell really exists or it is like our Master
describes  in  his 'Commedia'.  It was hot, but at least people in S.  Benedetto
del  Tronto  could  consider  themselves lucky as they were able to have a fresh
swim in a beautiful sea, a dreamlike wind caressing their hair.
On the beach there were a lot of people.  A bunch of boys were playing volley in
a  little  field made by some stripes of nylon.  They seemed to enjoy the match,
as  they were screaming and shouting really aloud, but they seemed to enjoy even
more  a  couple  of pretty girls, walking just where the water of the sea breaks
its  waves, as stated by their smiles and their, a little bit dirty, to tell the
truth, comments.
In  the  while  three little children were digging a hole in the sand, under the
protection of the worried eyes of their mothers.
They  did not want their creatures to take too much sun, they did not want their
sons to touch something that was not of them.
At  the  same  time  two  men  were  discussing  under the fresh shadow of a big
umbrella.  They were quarreling if Andreotti was guilty or not, if he had been a
mafioso or not, but they were mixing their speeches, and starting from Andreotti
they  were  finishing  by  wondering  if  Gardini  killed himself or he had been
murdered.   Near  them there was a group of men commenting the fact that Lentini
had  had a terrible car-accident.  One of them, however, was even worried by the
fact that Trapattoni had been re-confirmed as coach of Juventus (he was surely a
Juventus fan, you could recognize that by looking his face and his conviction in
his speech), that Maifredi had been surely better and Julio Cesar had a terrible
foot and he had been unable even to kick a ball.
So,  that  day  on the beach of San Benedetto del Tronto was passing as a normal
one of a normal summer of a normal year.
However there was also a strange figure, not really common, to tell the truth.
There was an old man, sitting on a chair.  A wooden chair, under the shadow of a
tree.  He was wearing a t-shirt old style, like the one many and many a year ago
were  used by gentlemen.  He had also a hat.  A little hat made by a paper, just
like bricklayers use to have on their head, to protect them from the rays of the
sun.
He was not sleeping, but he seemed not waken. He was just thinking deeply. 
Thinking  about a time where there were no women on the beach with naked breast,
where  the  holidays  were  a  time  to rest your body and your soul, in a quiet
place.   He could not understand.  He tried to do it but it could not.  He could
not  understand  how  young  boys  could enjoy holidays by listening all the day
those  noise radios, or by dancing during a time it has always been dedicated to
sleep.   He was not worried of that.  He was only sad because he was not able to
understand.
But  suddenly  other  three  old  men  came close to him, waking up him from his
thoughts.   They  told  him  something.   He smiled and followed them.  What was
happening?   They  were  kidnaping him?  They were catching him and closing in a
hospital?
No way.
They  took  from  a  bag  a  pack of cards and started to play.  One of them was
pouring wine into their glasses.
They were all on holidays, after all! Even if in 1993.
