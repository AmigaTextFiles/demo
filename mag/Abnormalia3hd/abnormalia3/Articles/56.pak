3                        MACNO'S CLOCK - A CRITICAL ESSAY

2                                 By The Ripper


This  is  a  manuscript found some years ago in the last residence of Macno, the
famous  novelist  who  brought  to  us  works such as 'From the window' and 'The
train'.   It seems that that nineteenth of May of that '30 Macno realized he was
going  to  die.   And in fact two days later, the twentyfirst, to be precise, he
left  this  world of pain.  But before leaving us he wrote this, as a witness of
his life, as a conclusion of his stories.
It's a really suffered text.
Let's  look  at the beginning; suddenly it appears to us, before everything, the
clock, as source of fears and mystery.  How we could not compare this beginning,
the  clock,  always  a  symbol  of  time,  and  so a symbol of death, to another
masterpiece  of the Gothic novel.  I'm referring to Edgar Allan Poe and his 'The
masque  of  Red  Death'  of  course.  Macno's clock looks like Prince Prospero's
clock.  They both are oppressive, they both lead to death.
However I would like to underline also the differences between Macno's clock and
the  one of Poe.  While in Poe it seems human being can try to fight against the
clock  (also  if it's defeated) in Macno the clock does not care about man, it's
too  superior,  it's  UNAWARE OF THE FACTS OF MY LIFE, as the reality of man and
the one of death did not collide.
But  let's go on.  After a pungent remark about school and barren knowledge (THE
GRINNING  FACE OF A SCHOOL BOOK) Macno stops our attention to another topic dear
to  every  great artist.  The own room.  Macno surely had in mind Petrarca while
he  was  writing  these lines.  The little room of Petrarca, which also inspired
him a sonnet, is, in a certain way, relived by Macno, who needs a place where he
can  stay  alone  and think.  Who could not compare 'THE BODY OF A LOVED PERSON'
with Laura?
But  after  this  short parenthesis the clock's back.  And the sense of the fear
too.   Love  and life have been disappeared.  The clock is now again the subject
and  time  is  passing.   It's THE MASTER OF MY LIFE, so the clock's reality and
Macno's  reality  have  found a common point, an intersection.  But, as almost a
final liberation, a Katharsis, the clock becomes what it has always been also if
not  evidently  THE  MASTER  OF MY LIFE, not a mate or a friend, but THE master.
Macno feels to be like a puppet in the hands of the destiny.  Human being can do
nothing, it's the death of Dante's 'Libero Arbitrio'.
Now  it's  the time to teach.  While the author was thinking, a town HAS DROWNED
IN A SEA OF STICKY GREY SMOG, Italy was RAPED BY GREEDY AND ARROGANT POLITICIANS
(who  could  be  the  arrogant if not Lega Nord).  Its didactic intent is shown.
It's useless to study and meditate, while our reality goes away, while our mates
in this earth destroy everything, using violence and selfishness.  We have to do
something.   Maybe  Macno  did  not  succeeded  in this intent, but he hopes, he
believes,  he  trusts in us, and we have to keep our moral promise.  He realizes
he  did  not  do anything to fight this bloody way of acting by bad people, as I
HAVE NEVER LEFT MY BODY AND MY BEDROOM, I HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD IF OUTSIDE THERE
COULD BE SOMETHING.
And  it's  again the clock.  As it begins the novel, now it ends it.  To compare
this  novel  to  a  human  life,  or better, to Macno's life is too easy and too
obvious.  But it's simply what the author wanted to say.
