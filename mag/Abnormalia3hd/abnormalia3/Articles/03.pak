                            2by RokDaZone of Destiny


Steve  was standing in the rain of a grey autumn evening just outside his house,
reconsidering the last minutes.

It  has  been  a  normal  day  in  a  normal life.  Getting up very early in the
morning,  some  toasts, one egg and a cup of coffee for breakfast, a sleepy kiss
from  his  wife.   The tube, overcrowded.  Smells of sweat, aftershave and cheap
sweet  eau  de  toilet.   Standing  there with the daily paper in one hand while
trying to keep balance by clinging to one of those cold metal struts.
Waiting. Working. Worrying.
In  the  evening  TV  and  sometimes - too often - arguments with his wife about
nothing.   Then  a  sudden  idea:  Why don`t you stand up?  Get up and go out of
that door, step down the stairs, open the housedoor and get out.  Out into a new
world; another chance.
With  eighteen, he only needed cigarettes, some fish and chips and ten pounds to
make it through the new day.
Should not be the probleme...
DAMNED, I am not too old!

Still,  he stood there outside in the cold.  Suddenly with a rough twitch of his
cold  hand,  he  turned  around and with long fast steps he flew into the lonely
night.

After ten minutes of stoic walking, he arrived at the first etappe of his quest:
Harry`s   supermarket.    The   word   supermarket  here  was  quite  ironically
exaggeration, because the small shop was nothing more than a kiosk, Steve nearly
knew  as  good  as  his  own  home - no, not home anymore - because of all these
uncounted  times,  he went into it to order the Daily Mirror, being on his daily
morning way to the tube.
Friendly,  but  astounded,  Harry  looked at his late guest,realizing the bitter
grin on his face, showing too much wrinkles for Steves real age...
"Good  Evenin`,  Mr.Miller.   It`s a lousy weather for a walk, isn`t it?" Steve,
without  having  recognised  what has been said, glanced at the small board with
the  tabacco-articles  behind  the  counter.   After about 20 seconds he finally
realised  the  bewildered  looks  of  Harry and mumbled something like "Benson &
Hedges, please." Harry was too astounded to ask whether his late guest wanted to
get the silver tab or the lights and passed the first one over to him, took five
pounds  and  gave  back  the exchange to Steve, who fastly went out of the shop.
This guy has not ordered cigarettes since more than ten years...

Steve hurried down the street with no specific direction.  His confused mind was
spinning around; his blood in his ears was quitely buzzing.
Later,  he  was  not able anymore to say exactly how long he was walking, but it
must have been 1 to 1.5 hours.
Suddenly,  his  conscience  got  back  and after some moments of orientatingless
looks to all sides, he knew were he had gone to.  This was the old harbour, once
a  busy  place, but nowadays dead like the cementary of San Francisco - although
the harbour was not as half as large than it.
Only  some  old  trailors lazily layed in the stinking waters of the small dirty
river.   A  slight  mist  was  hanging  over  the  deserted scenary, inventing a
depressing mood.
A  bit helpless, Steve stood in the weak light of an old latern, unknowing where
to  start the new life, he had just begun...  Damned, when he was younger, there
never  has  been  such a question, there was living and nothing else - no matter
how  deep  he got in troubles.  He suddenly had to think of the 21st March 1959,
when  he  was tiny 18.  He and his mates were out that night, boozing as always.
Youngsters!   The  grin  went  to  be a smile.  They had pretty much fun fooling
around and after spending all their money, they decided to steal some more booze
at  a  little shop.Two of them were suppossed to start a little "handy" argument
inside  of  the  shop  and when the owner gets aware and tries to stop them, the
others  should  grab  all the booze they could.  The only probleme was that when
the  two  started  their performance, two policemen - walking down the street by
chance  -  went in.  The two pretenders suddenly got very quite and with alot of
excuses left the shop.  Well, one of the others lost his nerves - he nearly shit
his  pants  being  so scared - and dropped one bottle of fine vodka which with a
sound  of  an  opened vaccuum exploded into thousand small glittering splinters.
The  policeman next to him looked at him, slowing turned his head down, again he
looked at him.  Slowly his hands went towards his weapon...

20  minutes  later they found themselves in the small police-department.  Steves
smile  decreased to be a grin.  He had to think of his parents.  After the first
shock,  they  cooked him at small heat.  Their relationship never went to be the
same  again.   They  did  not throw him out of their house and they even did not
show  any anger towards him, but there was suspect.  A cutting knife, sawing the
small  ledder  of  trust  within man.  They never said, "Your father misses five
pounds,  did  you  take it?" this would have make it easier for him to deal with
their mistrust.  No, they never showed it, his father just went his head and his
mother looked at him with sad eyes.
Even  though  they  found  most  things  back, they did not opened themselves to
him,they  looked  at  themselves  as  if saying:  " His conscience forced him to
bring it back, but he did not dare to excuse himself - what a coward!"

Steves  grin  totally disapeared, because train of thoughts did not stop at that
point.
`hey steve we have a long journey let us see your shame babe`

He  saw  his  face again, the face of that fat man behind the desk - one face of
many  -  turning  Steves` policerecord in his sweatty hands,telling him that his
company   would  have  liked,  working  together  with  him,  but  his  previous
convictions, he got, because he tried to escape the policemen by pushing one and
running  away,  "makes  it  impossible  for  us  to employ you." It was the main
reason,why  he  had  to become a ordinary worker, in spite of his good grades at
school.

A sudden noise made him aware.
He  looked up and saw two young tough guys coming towards him.  A huge black guy
and a brutal looking white punk.
When they saw him standing there in the lonely light, they slowed down, stopping
their loud conversation.
Steve looked around - the guys still were heading towards him - there was no way
to  escape for him, no house he could get into.  He made himself no illusions,no
matter how fast he would, run, this scum would be faster.  His breath got faster
and  he  could  feel  his heart pumping heavily.  He begged that it would do the
same after this here, but he did not know.
He  realized,  he  had  stumbled  back  some  steps,  but  then  he strenghtened
himself...   They  probably wanted his money and he only had approx.  12 pounds.
So, his life would be threatened anyway.

He  stood still now, like an old man.

The  punks  slowed down some more.  A bit unashured, they glanced at him then at
each others.  "Erm, Sir, don`t ya feel good - may we help ya?"
Steve  was  so  astounded,  later he even was not able to tell what has happened
then,he just tried to grin and replied something:  "No,...  no, it`s nothing, my
son."  After some more such phrases, he finally managed to convince them that he
was alright and they stepped into the dark.

Slowly,  he turned around, looking over the water of the small river.  "My son,"
he  said.   In fact,this young man nearly could have been his son.  Suddenly, he
compared his own son aged 15 to the white youngster.  He grabbed into his pocket
and  took  out  the small packet of cigarettes.  He stare at it as if he did not
know, how it went there.  With a sudden movement, he throwed the packet into the
river.
He  looked after it for some minutes, although he was not able to see it anymore
just after it hit the waters surface.  He felt, how his youth went down with the
packet.Down  to  somewhere  deep inside where no one was able to see it anymore,
except him, because he knows it was somewhere there.

Lonely, he walked through the streets of the city, he has been living in for all
of  his  life.  In the middle of a small bridge he paused and looked down at the
small  river - the same as the one, he had drowned his last chance in.  Suddenly
he  grinned and loudly said to himself:  "Fuck the lousy money for the Bensons,I
even do not have a lighter."
He  layed  his  head  back  and  laughed  at  the dark and at the sky above him.
Hysterically  first, then more and more it turned out to be a real laughter.  It
was too late to start it all over, but not to change himself.
