What would happen, if I just open the door and get out?
What would happen, if I just go downstairs and open the door and walk out?
What would happen in this beautiful night, if I - naked as I am - slowly
and half asleep step down the 26 stairs to the groundfloor of our house,
open the door and just walk outside?
And then, when I am outside, walk over to the small meadow, surrounded
by the small woods were as a child I played a thousand times,
lay myself down on the cool lawn?

The lawn, wet from the cooling of the air,
causing the humidity in it to fall down, would be a refreshing inspiration.
Then as I am lying there in the dim coolness,
surrounded by my childness spirit watching the stars and the moon,
my mind would travel.

And if it travelled? What would happen, if it would?
It would raise and raise and it would recognize, remember, reconsider
and it would experience.
In the middle of life with a sight to the end,
the beginn to learn would only take a small mathematical step.
C = A + B
A = C - B
And the beginn would lay open to my mind.

What would happen, if the beginn would lay open to my mind?
My mind would learn the meaning, the sense - eternity.
No question without an answer anymore.
And my mind would travel back into my body still watching the skies.

What would happen, if my mind would slip back into my body?
I'd know it all.
Every probleme could be solved by me.
Every theory would become practicable.
Every truth would be verified.
Every lie would be identified.
And I could be everything. I could write books and learn people the truth.
My knowledge could save the world.
No children to die anymore.
No need to hate when all conflicts could be solved in salomonic judgement.
And I would be everything,

What would happen, if I had those possibilities?
I would stand up with a light feel insight of me after having thought
about me and the beginning for a second.
I would get up and raise.
With every question of mine solved I would go back to my home.
I'd take a long rope.
A rope that could keep two cars moving in different directions together.
A strong rope.
And with this rope I'd strangulate myself.

With all the knowledge inside
with every probleme solved
with every theory practicable
with every truth verified
with every lie identified
there wouldn't be one single question making me carry on.
WHY?
