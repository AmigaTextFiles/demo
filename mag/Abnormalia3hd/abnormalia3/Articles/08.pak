Stefan Writen opened slowly the massive book.

Black cover, no writings on the front, no writings on the back,
nothing to give a direction to the pages.

Small characters, strict interlines, thin paper,
more than two thousand pages.
After all it was the book of his life.

He  had  bought  it  from  a  strange  old dude, wearing a long blue dress and a
funnily  long  hat.   That  man seemed the creation of a fable for children, the
joke of an unoriginal fantasy writer.
Stefan  had  observed him and, without any intelligible reason, he had asked him
what was the title of the huge black book he was handling, severely closed.
"The  book  of  thy  life  it is, esteemed Mr.  Writen", had replied the bizarre
character.
"My life? And how can you know my name?", astonished had asked Stefan.
"Just  let  your eyes lay on its words, it costs the coin of eternity", had been
the mysterious reply.
"Who are you? What's this coin?".
"Wait the end of your life before reading it, noble sire, I'm Merlyn, lorekeeper
of  The  Magic Guild, remember to mention me in your memories", the magician had
handled Stefan the book and had walked away, disappearing in the past.

The remembrances of the episode came back once again to Stefan's mind.
He  had  waited  his  whole  life, he had lived with the black book accompanying
every move, thought, decision of his.
The temptation of opening it had often crossed his hands but something seemingly
stronger,  maybe  inside  him,  maybe  not, prevented him from breaking Merlyn's
advice.
Merlyn.
The  same  name  had  been a constant sound tickling in his ears, a never ending
background  noise,  like  the  same  book,  which  had never left his mind, in a
continuous uninterrupted warning buzz.
His  life  was  walking towards its natural conclusion, he knew that and he knew
that it was the moment.  The moment to read the book.

Solemnly he breathed, sat down, breathed deeper.
Stefan Writen opened slowly the massive book.

and he started to read

it was the book of his life

the black book bought from Merlyn

a far lost day at his childhood's end.

Hours passed. Days passed.
Stefan's eyes were running on the pages without pauses,
no need to eat, to drink, to defecate,
the story of the book was feeding his mind,
words were food, sentences were water.
Breathing  slowly, regularly, in a time without time, on the arcane pages of the
book, he read every event of his life.
It was all there,
told in the pages of a book which he had had for half a century.
Everything.

The day of his birth, the juvenile joys and light delusions, the first loves and
the studies, the work and the life.
Parents and sons, relatives and friends, seen faces and known names,
it was all there.
He  was reading on the pages of the book the whole history of his life and while
digesting word after word he was wondering what could be the end.
He  tried  to  imagine  how  could be his death, how the pages of the book could
describe it, what could be the taste of his last second.

The book was talking about itself too.
The book was telling its own story.
It  told  the sequence of its influences on Stefan's life.  All the indecisions,
hesitations,  irresolutions,  he had during his existence, due to the same book,
which was hanging on him, like a Damocles' sword.
He  had  always  been  weak  and wavering, with the only certainty of that book,
maybe  forgotten in a drawer, maybe lost in the dust, which had left a deep mark
on his mind and acts.
The book of Stefan Writen's life was talking also about itself.
The book was alive and wanted to survive.

"Stefan Writen opened slowly the massive book"

He read that final line, he read it again, he wondered disappointed what was the
end  of the book and the end of his life, he couldn't understand that those were
really the last words of the books and the last words of his life's story.

Then he remembered Merlyn's words and he understood. Terrified.

The coin of eternity.
He  was  condemned  to  read  the  book  of his life forever, the name of Merlyn
dancing eternally on waves of hate.
