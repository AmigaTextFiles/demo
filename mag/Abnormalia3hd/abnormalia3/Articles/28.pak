3                   THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER - AN ESSAY

2                           by The Ripper of Nightfall


                            It is an ancient Mariner
                         And he stoppeth one of three.
                  "By thy long gray beard and glittering eye,
                        Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?"

Italians always think to have the best literature in the world, they claim to be
the  best  writers,  poets and so on screaming that the perfection of Petrarca's
sonnet  has  never been reached by anyone, that Dante's rhyme and fantasy is the
greatest  ever  found in the world (well, maybe that's right...  Don't you think
so Macno?), that Manzoni is God in writing prose and so on...  The funny fact is
that also strangers think Italian culture's the best.
Just  have a look at one of the latest issue of Zine where Orlando wrote that he
loves  the  'Commedia'  (we know he's a clever guy!) and Boccaccio is one of his
favourite writers.
However I don't agree with him. At least not completely.
English  literature, for instance, is full of great writers and poets, it's full
of great novels and deep poetry.
Take  a  look  on  above.   The  first four lines of this text.  You will surely
recognize the mentioned lines as the first of 'The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner',
a  ballad,  written  by  Samuel  Taylor  Coleridge  and published in the Lyrical
Ballads,  a  collection  of  poems  done  together  with  William Wordsworth and
released  in  1798.   It  tells a story and its chief events are governed by the
supernatural;  it  has  a tragic ending and it relates the adventures of one key
character, the ancient mariner himself.
Its  language  is basically simple and direct with deliberate archaisms however,
to suggest the flavour of the old ballads and the imagery has the ballad's blunt
directness and realism drawing on everyday concepts and parallels.
Coleridge  has chosen the standard ballad metre, the four-line stanza, though he
varied  it  with  longer stanzas, and all the literary devices of the ballad are
present such as repetition, alliteration and internal rime.
'The  Rime  Of The Ancient Mariner' has some of characteristics of the epic.  It
tells  of  a  voyage,  a long and varied voyage which is not a quest because the
mariner  is  not consciously seeking for anything; indeed he is strongly passive
for  a  central  figure.   The  only three active steps he takes are to kill the
albatross,  which  precipitates  the  tragedy,  to bite his arm so that his lips
moistened  with  his  blood  can  summon help, and his blessing the water-snakes
which gives him a chance of redemption.
The  mariner  is  no  Ulysses'  figure, but the epic element is contained in the
greatness  of  Coleridge's  creation.   The  theme  is  no account of a contrast
between  the  real world and the ghosts of the traditional medieval pattern, but
it  is  a vast and comprehensive moral proposition.  The mariner commits the sin
of  the  motiveless  killing  of  the albatross but it's not just a bird that is
killed.   The  act  is  symbolic  and  the mariner has committed a crime against
creation, against the positive life force; he has destroyed a part of the beauty
of a divinely ordained universe.
His  shipmates are not without sin, they are guilty also, for they first condemn
and  then praise the act with brutal concentration on their own welfare, with no
true  comprehension  of the nature of the mariner's act.  For this they die, but
their  punishment  is not so heavy as the mariner's sentence of eternal life and
eternal  compulsion  to  relive  his crime in the repeated narration of it.  The
mariner's  act  of  blessing  the  water-snakes, an act of positive love towards
creation,  gives  him a hope of redemption because it leads him to a recognition
of  the  value  of all created things and so Coleridge has traced the pattern of
sin,  punishment,  penitence  and  redemption.  The voyage of the ship is into a
realm,  remote from the real world and the spirits have a cosmic force; even the
Polar  Spirit  is  subjected  to  the angelic troop that inhabits the dead men's
bodies  on  the  homeward  voyage.   In contrast to this spirit world is set the
world  of  the  Wedding-Guest, with its happy realities of the bridal procession
and  festivity;  these  two  reinforce  by  comparison  the  strangeness  of the
mariner's  experience.  The Wedding-Guest is at first an unwilling listener, his
attention  half-distracted  by  the wedding feast he's missing, but, by the end,
he's  'a sadder and wiser' man; he has been given a revelation of the meaning of
life, of the great verities.
The  didactic  intent of the poem is shown by the moral Coleridge clearly states
at  the  end  of the poem:  'prayeth best who loveth best, All things both great
and small'.  Some critics (for instance THe RiPPeR 8-}!) extend the moral lesson
further,  finding  in  the  killing  of  the  albatross  and the blessing of the
water-snakes a parable of original sin, of gratuitous fall and of redemption.
There remains a deeper level still at which the poem can be studied:  the voyage
of  the  ancient mariner is into a world of irrationality in which ordinary laws
of  cause  and  effect  are  suspended and this has led many critics to seek for
deeper  symbolic  meanings  in  the  poem.  Most interesting is the theory of an
American  critic  (R.Warren)  who notes a constant contrast between sunlight and
moonlight  in  the poem and classifying the main events of the poem according to
the  kinds of light which they occur finds that the good events take place under
the  aegis  of  the moon and the bad events under the aegis of the sun.  The sun
then  stands  for  day,  representing the enlightened power of reason, while the
moon  stands  for  night, when moonlight diffuses a 'sudden charm' over a 'known
and  familiar  landscape',  representing  the  importance  and  the power of the
imagination.
Well,  maybe some of you could think that this is a 'rape' of the text, that the
poem has been forced to tell something Colerigde did not think.  It's up to you.
Read the whole poem, think and then write to Abnormalia for any comment.
