Since  when  mankind  discovered to be the only intelligent living form on Earth
and   that   there  were  other  planets,  the  doubt  about  the  existence  of
extraterrestrial intelligent life has crossed many human minds.

Even  if  we  can  strongly believe about the existence of intelligent life in a
universe  which  seems  incredibly  large to have it only on Earth, up to now we
haven't  any real official certainty about extraterrestrial life, for the simple
fact  that  we have never had, for now, any prove of its existence (for a slight
different   starting  point  about  this,  read  the  articles  about  "The  UFO
conspiracy" in this same mag).

That's  not  a  good  reason, anyway, not to try to figure out how it could be a
possible "alien".
We have to take into consideration many levels of difference.
Usually  the typical popular "martian" has a humanoid shape, sometimes it is the
big  version of known animals (reptiles, insects, worms...  all evident signs of
the  view  of an alien as a frightful enemy), sometimes it hasn't any particular
shape  (see  the  movie  "Blob").   All  these stereotypes obviously come from a
certain  kind  of  SF  literature  and  cinematography who have had easy work in
impressing  people's imagination.  Actually they all are influenced by our world
and our reality.
We should haven't too many reasons to figure a possible alien as humanoid.
This  idea just comes from the consideration that evolution ON EARTH has reached
its  highest  step  (up  to  now)  in  man (this statement could be considered a
relative  and  "anti-animalist" one, but it's not the case to discuss this topic
here)  but  we  haven't  many  reasons  to  believe  that in other planets, with
different  physic  condition,  the evolution's path would be similar.  Anyway it
seems  that in order to have any kind of culture (and therefore of technological
development),  in  conditions  similar  to  our  one, some particular aspects of
mankind are just necessary.  Language is something much more important than what
may seem at first glance.
Especially  the invention of WRITTEN language which can assure the creation of a
lasting  and  stable culture which can be spreaded more easily (that means, very
roughly,  that  what  is discovered and invented by somebody, can be used by the
ones that follows without many problems).  Also other animal species have a sort
of  own  language, but it's not something that can be somehow "written" in order
to be used by other members of the same species.
Another example is the fact that we live in the air and not in water.  It may be
silly,  but  even  if  dolphins  were much more intelligent than men, they could
hardly  develop  a  technological society, because they couldn't handle fire and
without it they couldn't easily morph materials.
These actually are restrictions valid in a world like our and in conditions like
ours,  they  could be totally irrelevant for a living form that can morph metals
changing  their  molecular structure and ties with some odd "power of the mind",
for example.

Before going on I'd like to make a little parenthesis.
What  could  be  the dimension of a possible extraterrestrial intelligent living
form?  Are we sure that a possible alien is in our same order of dimensions?
It  could  be  greater  than  man, and this is acceptable by our imagination, in
certain limits, and it could be much smaller.
Thinking  again  about  all  the  UFO matter you can read about on these pages I
found quite entertaining the idea of a UFO spaceship of the dimensions of a bee!
What prevents us from excluding such a possibility?
Somehow  human  already  strong  sense  of superiority could have easy work in a
similar  situation.   Could  you  figure  the president of USA having diplomatic
meetings  with  aliens,  technologically  much more advanced than us but smaller
than ants?

Another level of difference is the biochemical and genetic one.
ALL the living forms on Earth are based on DNA or RNA chains.
From  animals  to  bacteria,  from  vegetables to viruses (which are at the edge
between  life  and  not-life,  according  to  some  definitions),  all duplicate
themselves and can live by mean of DNA (or RNA in rare cases).
That's not something so obvious as it may seem.  Why we have never seen ANY kind
of life based on different molecules?
Are these the only molecules that can be at the base of life?
Probably  not,  probably  they  were  the ones which were better for the Earth's
conditions at the time they have been formed.
Probably the first steps of evolution had been the ones which let to the ancient
"fathers" of these molecules to survive and reproduce.
Another  point has to be added.  It seems that Carbon is the only atom which can
be  at  the  base of life.  There are many reasons for that, they are all due to
its chemical characteristics.
One of the most important is Carbon's capability of making long chains of Carbon
atoms.   You  will never see a stable chain of 10 Oxygen atoms tied directly one
after one.
This  fact  makes  possible the construction of relatively huge molecules, whose
complexity seems necessary for life.
Somebody has theorized the possibility of Silicon based life.
Silicon has many of the Carbon properties but seems to lack some other important
ones  (in  particular is crucially different the strength of the bond with H and
O).
Of  course we can't know if life is possible with other basic atoms than Carbon.
As  we  can  conceive it, as it can develop in situations similar to our one, it
MUST  need  Carbon  and  therefore it also needs a certain range of temperature,
pressure, and so on.
Nevertheless  I  wouldn't  be totally surprised to know of living forms based on
something totally different and able to live in totally different conditions.

This  brings  us to a third possible level of difference between terrestrial and
extraterrestrial life.
It's something based on radically different presuppositions.
For  example  on  Frederick  Pohl's  novel  "The  World  at  the End of Time" is
conceived  a  living  form  which  lives  inside  the stars and it's not made of
matter.
Not  something  like  "pure spirit" which seems to appeal to many religions, but
something based on the bonds among known or unknown sub-nuclear particles (which
are quite hard to consider to be made by matter...  at a certain level (just see
the electron) the difference between matter and energy is quite arbitrary).
It's  obvious  that  if  we  start  from this point all our considerations about
Carbon  based  life  or  humanoid aliens become useless.  We can't conceive what
could  be  the  living conditions for these beings, we can't know if we can even
"see" them, we can hardly imagine how we could communicate with them.
At this point we can also argue if they LIVE or not, being so different from our
standards and therefore so far from the semantic areas of our languages.

A  fourth  level  of difference, which ironically is somehow easier to grasp, is
the idea of life based on "pure spirit", as anticipated before.
If  we  have  to  take  this statement literally, it would be something not even
related  to some kind of particle.  It's pure energy, religions like to say, but
energy  is  NOT  nothing.  One of the basic definition of life can relate to its
capability of duplicating itself.
Can energy duplicate itself?
The  question  actually  is  badly  inserted (it just waited for an obvious "No!
Energy  can't  be  created  from  nothing!")  for the fact that at this level of
speculation  it's  pointless  to  use  our limited physic laws (as the one about
energy).
Probably  the  same  Pohl  in  the  mentioned  novel has somehow tried to give a
scientific description of a possible God, therefore even a kind of "pure spirit"
life,  not made of matter and somehow able to do everything, can't be excluded a
priori.

What  I  find surprising is that people seem to believe more easily in this kind
of life than in other forms, far less different from our own one.
