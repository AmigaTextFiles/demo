                                    2by Macno


In my bedroom there is a big clock.
It  ticks  the  seconds  of  the world, one after one, it transforms future into
past, without stops, seemingly unaware of the facts of my life.
In my bedroom I have studied, I have loved, I have thought, I have slept.

While my eyes were staring the grinning face of a school book or while they were
laying  curious on the pages of a novel, while they were losing their control on
reality,  finding  oblivious through the window or while they were caressing the
body  of  a  loved person, while they were close, turning randomly in a dream or
while  they were open, receiving light from a gray monitor, while I was counting
the  seconds  of my life the clock was always there, with its severe and distant
smile.

In  my bedroom I have planned and I have lived, I have laughed and I have cried,
I have handled my life, from childhood to the end of my days.
In  my bedroom I have thought and I have meditated,  I have sought for a meaning
of life and I have built my career.
In  my bedroom I have decided  to  stay single,  to  play  the teacher,  to find
solution in knowledge, trying to understand me and the others.

And  the  clock has always ticked, it has never stopped to remind me that it was
the  master of my life, that time was with it and in time my existence had to be
limited.
I  have  tried  to  go  ahead,  to bypass the ties of time, to forget my earthly
presence,  meditating  and  reading,  looking  outside the window where universe
could open endless arms to my mind.
Maybe  only the farthest parts of the universe can break or distort the loose of
time  or  maybe  not,  maybe  it's  meaningless to consider things without their
temporal essence.

While  my  life was running, while I was trying somehow to break, to breathe, to
catch the secret behind it, everything has changed.
My  same bedroom, which has seen different furniture, my town, which has drowned
in  a  sea  of  sticky  gray  smog,  my country, crossed and raped by greedy and
arrogant politicians, the world, the world itself has changed.
It has become more egoist, rude, poor, evil, dirty, crowded.
It has forgotten any possible reason, it has lost a task, a progress, the joy of
silence.

I  was  born  the  sixth of June 1970, I am dying the nineteenth of May 2030, my
life  has  passed  like  many  others,  suffering  daily  pangs  and existential
meditations,  finding  moments  of deep joy and total despair, all related to my
earthly way of considering the things.
I  have  never  left  my body and my bedroom, I have never understood if outside
there could be something, maybe myself, I have lived just material seconds which
the clock has never stopped to count.
