Bob was a God.
A  real  one, of course, he had created his own universe and he could do all the
miracles he wanted, after all the physic of his universe was invented by him.
A  funny  physic  actually, based on few basic principles, one of these was that
weighty  masses  could  attract other masses.  Actually everything that had some
weight had the power of attracting other things.
Yes, I know, it's something really weird but it seemed to work.
His  universe was based on groups of weighty masses of less and less dimensions,
they were then based on little things rotating around bigger things, which could
attract things better.
For  the  ones  of  you  who don't know it, a weighty thing is something that...
well...  that has weight...
Weight  is  a  sort  of  force  connected to the mass of the things, the mass is
related to the matter, the more matter you have and, more or less, the more mass
you have.
Well,  anyway,  I  can't  explain everything to you now, if in your universe you
have  mass  and  matter  maybe  you  can  understand (even if I'm sure that mass
doesn't attract other mass over there), if not...  well, that's your problem.
Back  to our Bob.  He was quite happy of his universe he even invented something
quite unique for a universe.
He called it "life".
Now,  I  don't  really  know  how  I can explain you this concept.  I mean, it's
really hard.  A terribly hard concept to grasp.  Really weird.
Let's  try  anyway.   He  invented things able to duplicate themselves and which
couldn't exist for much time in their shape.
The concept of life is related to the one of "death".
One of these things, which we'll call "living forms", hadn't life forever.  Only
in  a particular moment, during their life indeed, they could "live", then death
had to come and to cease their existence, in that living shape.
Because, of course, the parts with which they were made could last forever.
Anyway,  these  living  forms  were  quite  strange  because  their  task was to
duplicate  themselves in other similar living forms, which, actually weren't the
same!
Yes,  it's  an impossible paradox, but Bob was an odd God and he strongly wanted
this caprice in his universe.
I  don't  know  if  you  have  understood  this  original  idea, anyway it's not
important, I don't think you'll meet it again in one of your worlds.

The funniest thing, anyway, is yet to come.
Among  all  his  living  forms,  which he cured and loved as himself, he created
"intelligent living forms".
This is the strangest thing of the whole story.
He  wanted  something  that  could  think about him!  He wanted that some of his
living forms, the intelligent ones, could understand who made them and thank him
for that!
Yes, Bob was like a child after all, but that's his character.
Anyway  he  created  on a big ball of matter many living forms and among them he
inserted  the  intelligent  ones.   He  followed  them for some time and then he
decided that they could be ready to accept and welcome their God.
Bob  was  a  bit  simple-minded  after  all,  he thought that it was natural and
obvious that his creatures could host him in their ball (according to Bob it was
a  "planet",  whatever a planet can be) with all the honours of the case, but he
made his creatures in a wrong way, maybe, and the result had been curious.
When  he  showed  himself  to  them  he  wanted to assume their own shape, so he
thought that they could accept him more easily.
Well, I won't tell you all the story of his advent, but he finished crucified on
a wood cross.
Bob  was  so  astonished  of  the  reception he gained that he decided to remain
incognito in his own world.
Don't  ask  me  why,  but probably he was really fond of his universe and of the
creatures  who treated him so bad.  Maybe he was a bit masochist but actually he
realized  that  his  intelligent  living  forms  had started to think about him.
Well,  actually they had always invented thousands of gods, none of them had the
look  of  Bob, but he thought that the important thing was that they believed in
some kind of superior being.
But now I'm going too far...
What? What Bob stands for?
Well, it's the short for Robert West, he now lives somewhere in London.
Don't ask me what's London, I don't know.
