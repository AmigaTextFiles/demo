                                    2By Peto


 Once  upon  a time there was a king of Cynerice whose name was Graedig.  He was
the  most  powerful  human  king in Weorold, but still he was angry - especially
now,  when  he was in the humble village of Tun, far from the big and passionate
cities of Cynerice.
 "Where is that foolish jester?" he yelled.
 "Here  I  am,  my  lord", Betst the jester answered and arrived in front of the
king.  "Oh, my lord is sad.  Let me make you happy.  This is my newest song:
 It was an early spring,
   when I began to sing,
   I saw a wicked thing,
      that was our k...  Oops!"
 "Guard!  Arrest that fool!" Graedig shouted very angrily.
 "Wasn't it funny?" Betst stuttered.  "Everybody else likes this song..."
 "What?   Who?"  Graedig  yelled  even  more  angrily.   Then he calmed down and
muttered  in  the Elven tongue:  "Oderint, dum metuant." He looked at the jester
who noticed a gleam in his majestic eyes.
 "You  have  two  choices",  Graedig  said,  "Either  you'll  bring me the Magic
Balls..."
 "What is the second one?" Betst said, "I'll choose it."
 "...or you'll die", Graedig continued.
 "How should I die?" Betst asked unhesitatingly.
 "Slowly and painfully", Graedig answered.
 "How slowly and painfully?" Betst asked a bit nervously.
 "Very  slowly  and  even more painfully", Graedig said in a deep voice.  But he
was  surprised, because Betst still considered what to do.  Then Graedig had his
last word and said:
 "I'm  sure  you,  my  dear jester, and Bana the executioner are going to have a
really good time together..."
 When  Betst  heard  these  words, he looked at the big and hairy man beside the
king  and  remembered  all  the  rumours about Bana and his victims.  Finally he
said:
 "How  could  I  bring  you  the  Magic Balls?  Many great heroes have tried it.
Grimlic,  Swatig  and even Manslyht tried to bring you them, but they never came
back.   How  could  I  do it, if those great heroes failed?  I'm just an unfunny
jester."
 "Don't ask me anything!" Graedig said, "You have one year to bring me the Magic
Balls.   Don't  try  to  escape!   I'll find you.  Now go!  If you fail, I'll be
really  mad,  but  Bana  won't.   Bana, you like to play with the living bodies,
don't you?"
 "Bana wants a toy", Bana said, "Bana wants a jester."
 "Not yet, Bana", Graedig said, "Not yet."

 After  Betst left the royal palace, he went to the house where the knights used
to  spend  the  nights.  Many of them were his friends, when they were children.
He would also like to become a knight himself, but his talent wasn't sufficient.
He was weak and frail, and he wasn't brave at all.  Because he couldn't become a
knight,  his friends had made fun of him.  This was the reason why he decided to
become  a  jester.   "If  they  treat  me like a jester, I will be a jester", he
thought.   But  now  -  after  many  years - Betst came back in the house of the
knights, and he asked them to help.  But the knights laughed at him.
 "Have you lost your inspiration to invent new jokes?" one asked.
 "That one was lost years ago", the other laughed.
 "I  don't  need  help  to invent new jokes!" Betst said angrily, "I thought the
most  important  job  of the knights is to help the helpless people, not to make
fun of them."
 "Our  job  is  help  the  helpless female people", one knight smiled mockingly,
"You're  not  useful  to  us!"  All the knights laughed at this chauvinist joke.
Betst was stunned.
 "Isn't here really anybody who would like to go with me and get the Magic Balls
to the king?" Betst asked.
 Now  the knights didn't laugh anymore.  On the contrary they paled and left the
house  one  by  one.   One  wanted feed his horse, the other wanted to shine his
armor.   Soon  Betst  was alone in the room.  "Cowards!" he thought, but he knew
they were not the only ones who feared the name of the Magic Balls.

 Betst left the village of Tun where he had made the people laugh for years.  He
hated  the king - like almost everybody did - but mostly he hated himself.  "Why
I have to be so stupid?  Why I didn't believe my father?" His late father Betera
had  been  the  most famous wizard in Cynerice and even Graedig feared him.  But
Betst  couldn't  endure  the  great reputation of his father.  He knew everybody
would  always  compare  him  with his famous father.  That was the reason why he
decided to become anything but not a wizard, although he wasn't more talented as
a  jester than as a knight.  Soon most people forgot whose son was their jester.
But  there was still one old man who remembered who he was.  That man was Gleaw,
another wizard and a fellow worker of his father.  When Betst walked through the
sunny countryside, he decided to visit in the tower of the great wizard.

 Gleaw's  tower  was  in  the  middle  of the forest of Beam.  Graedig hated and
persecuted  all  the  wizards.   That was the reason why Gleaw had enchanted the
forest by magic so that nobody could find his tower without his permission.  But
Betst  knew nothing about this.  He walked into the forest like he had done many
times  when  he was a child.  Gleaw knew somebody was coming, but he couldn't do
anything.   The  person  who  came  was  more  powerful than him.  Gleaw thought
Graedig  had  finally discovered the way to break the enchantment.  If Betst had
known  about  these,  he  would  have  been very surprised.  But he was a son of
Betera,  and  he  had  a  great  part of the strength of his father, although he
didn't know that.

 Easily  Betst  found  his way to the tower where Gleaw waited with the sword in
his hand.
 "Who's there?" Gleaw asked.
 "I  am the king of the jesters and the jester of the kings", Betst answered and
continued:   "And  you  aren't any wiser than you used to be, if you think I'm a
goblin."
 Gleaw exclaimed joyfully, welcomed warmly and led him into the tower.
 "It's  great  to  see  you  again", Gleaw said, "You have grown since I saw you
last.   You  look  exactly  like  your father.  Tell me which made you come here
after so many years?"
 Then  Betst  told  the  whole  story, and when he finished, Gleaw looked at him
sadly.
 "Oh  my  son.  What have you done?" Gleaw said, "Why do all the young boys want
to become heroic knights?"
 "Don't  remind  me  of  my past mistakes!" Betst shouted angrily, "If you don't
want to save my life, I'll do it myself!"
 "Relax,  my dear son", Gleaw said appeasingly, "I know more than you about your
problem.   If  you  failed  -  and  that's  very  probable - you'll die.  If you
succeeded,  Graedig  will  get his hands on the Magic Balls, and then he will be
able to rule the whole Weorold by their magic."
 "I didn't know that", Betst said, "What can I do?"
 "I  wish I know", Gleaw sighed, "I can't order you to do anything.  You'll have
to  make  the  decision.   To  go,  or not to go, - that is the question...  But
however you decide, I'm going to help you."
 "Tell  me  about  the  Magic  Balls",  Betst  requested, "It would be easier to
decide, if I knew why everybody fears their name."
 "Well,  the  Magic  Balls are not terrifying", Gleaw explained, "As a matter of
fact,  there  are  many  people  who'd  like to have them.  Those balls give the
absolute  power  to  their  owner.   That's the reason why Graedig wants to have
them.   But  the journey to the land of the Magic Balls is very dangerous.  Many
great  heroes  have tried to go there, but nobody has come back.  You have heard
about Grimlic, Swatig and Manslyht..."
 "Yes,  I  have",  Betst  said, "Tell me about the journey.  Maybe I'll die, but
probably I'll do it more comfortably there than in Bana's hairy hands..."
 "I'm  not  that  sure",  Gleaw  muttered, but he asked Betst to look at the map
which  he  had  on  the table.  "Now we are here, and here is Tun where you just
came from.  You have to go to the north of here.  There is the mountain range of
Sliab which is Fyrgen in our tongue..."
 "Sliab?" Betst asked, "It sounds strange..."
 "It's  Dwarvish",  Gleaw explained, "Dwarves still live in their hidden city of
Cathir.   When I was young, men and dwarves were still friends, and many of us -
for  example your father - even visited in Cathir.  Dwarves also used to let men
cross  the mountains through the pass of Intled.  But then Graedig began to lust
after  their  gold,  and  there  haven't  been  much friendship after that.  Now
dwarves  don't  let anybody through Intled.  Everybody who has tried has died an
arrow in his throat.  Still, this is the only way to cross the mountains..."
 "An arrow in my throat?", Betst said, "I still think it's more comfortable than
Bana's fingers in my throat..."
 "All  right",  Gleaw continued, "If you survive the pass of Intled, you'll have
to go through the forest of Silva..."
 "Silva?" Betst said, "That sounds Elvish!"
 "Yes,  it's the name of the forest in the Wood-elven dialect", Gleaw said, "But
it's  a  very  dangerous  place,  because  elves  don't  trust  mortals anymore.
Everybody who walks into their forest falls asleep eternally..."
 "That's wonderful!" Betst said, "Sleeping is my favorite hobby!"
 "Really?"  Gleaw  said, "If you also survive the forest of Silva, you'll arrive
in the land of Perkele where the Magic Balls are."
 "Perkele?" Betst asked, "Boy, that's an ugly name."
 "Yes, that's the name of the country in the Goblin tongue", Gleaw said, "It's a
very  ugly tongue.  But if you're going to get the Magic Balls to the king, then
you'll have to listen that tongue even more."
 "Oh my God!" Betst said, "I think I'll rather choose Bana's hairy hands!"
 "Be  a  man!  I have some useful instruments which would be able to help you in
your mission", Gleaw said and showed a small bag.
 "What does it include?" Betst asked.
 "I  don't  know", Gleaw said, "Your father gave this bag to me a long time ago.
He  said:   If  somebody wants to get the Magic Balls, everything he needs is in
this bag."
 "My father?" Betst asked and took the bag, "How is it possible?"
 "He was a great foreteller", Gleaw said, "Maybe he knew that one day you'd have
to get the Magic Balls!"
 "That's  great!"  Betst  delighted,  "Bana's  going  to  be badly disappointed!
Farewell, my friend!  We'll meet again!"
 "Farewell!" Gleaw said and looked how Betst disappeared into the forest.

 Betst  went northwards, until he saw the mountain range of Fyrgen (or Sliab) in
front  of  him.   Soon  he  found the pass of Intled.  When he looked around, he
couldn't  see  anything,  but  he  felt how numerous eyes looked at him.  But he
trusted  the  bag of his father and began to walk through the pass.  Then he saw
that something lay in the sand.  When he looked it more carefully, he noticed it
was Grimlic's skeleton with an arrow in his throat.  "Now I'm as good as him, at
least"  Betst  thought,  but  suddenly  he  saw somebody in front of him.  Betst
hadn't  ever  seen any dwarves, but now he knew at once that this little bearded
creature was one of them.
 "A fir!" the dwarf said, "Is trog lim do marbad!"
 "Excuse me", Betst said, "Can you speak this language?"
 But  the  dward  didn't understand anything, or he wasn't talkative at all.  He
shot  an  arrow  which snapped in two parts before it would have hit Betst.  The
dwarf  was  very  surprised,  and  Betst was even more.  Then the dwarf shouted:
"Dech!"  and  fled from the pass.  Betst was alone again.  He understood the bag
saved his life, but he couldn't know how it had happened.

 When  Betst had crossed the mountains through the pass, he saw a wide forest in
front  of  him,  and he knew it had to be Silva.  The wind blew from the forest,
and he yawned.  "I'm only tired", he tried to convince himself and went into the
forest  where he saw again that somebody lay on the ground.  In this time he was
Swatig  who seemed to sleep, but he was dead, although his body hadn't rotted at
all.   "He  shouldn't have forgotten his caffein pills", Betst said and laughed.
His  bag  had  made  him  more  self-confident.  Suddenly he heard a clear voice
behind him:
 "Non dubito, quin te huius facti mox paeniteat!"
 Betst turned around and saw an angry elf whose spear pointed at him.
 "Ave!"  Betst  said  the  only  word which he was able to say in Elvish, and he
continued  in  his  own  tongue:  "I had hoped that the elves are more courteous
than the dwarves."
 Before  anything  happened,  the spear snapped in two pieces.  The elf shouted:
"Optimus!"  and  disappeared.   Betst  smiled  and  patted his bag.  Now he knew
absolutely  that  nothing  would  be able to stop his journey to the land of the
Magic Balls.

 Although  it  was  still  an early spring, the weather was extremely cold, when
Betst  arrived  in  the  destination.  "So this is Perkele", he thought, when he
looked  around and couldn't see anything, but the desert - and a dry skeleton in
the  dust.   "Poor  Manslyht!   You were the greatest of them!  This must be the
empties land in Weorold.  Now I really your help, my bag.  Tell me where are the
Magic  Balls!"  But  the  bag was quiet.  "Thank you.  When the situation is the
worst,  you  can't  help  me.   Now  the  only  thing I need would be a bunch of
goblins", he finally said as a joke.  Soon he heard ugly voices behind him:
 "Hakkaa p‰‰lle Pohjan peikko, ettei voita vieras heikko!"
 Betst  saw  three  goblins, but he didn't fear at all.  On the contrary, he had
got  tired  of  the  attackers  whose  weapons always used to snap in two parts.
Goblins  shouted:   "Paras!" and escaped.  But Betst began to look for the Magic
Balls,  until  he  had  searched  the  whole  year.  Then he finally gave up and
decided to return to Cynerice.

 Betst's  return  was  very  uneventful.   His  face was so angry that everybody
evaded him, until he arrived in the village of Tun where Graedig and his knights
were waiting him.
 "Finally  my dear jester has come back", Graedig said mockingly, "Did you bring
me the Magic Balls from Perkele?"
 "No,  I  didn't",  Betst  said,  "There aren't any Magic Balls or other things.
It's the emptiest place in Weorold."
 "You  seem  to  be a better jester than ever", Graedig said, "This is the first
time  you  make  me  laugh.   You're  a liar.  You have never been even close to
Perkele.  Knights!  Give this worthless fool to Bana!"
 But  when the knights came nearer, their swords snapped in two pieces, and they
shouted:   "Betst!"  and  ran  away.   Soom Betst was alone with Graedig who was
shocked by something which he had almost forgot.
 "Bana!" Graedig shouted, "Help me!"
 Bana came with the insane smile in his face.
 "Take him!" Graedig shouted, "He's yours!"
 "Stop!"  Betst  said,  and Bana was petrified.  Then Betst smiled and looked at
Graedig who began to curse in the Goblin tongue:
 "Paskapersevittuperkelesaatanahelvettijumalauta..."
 "Gosh!   You  must  have many Goblin friends", Betst said, "Your subjects would
not like it, if they found out..."
 "Quiet!"  Graedig  said,  "You  remind  me of one very mulish wizard who always
resisted me, before I killed him..."
 "What was his name?" Betst asked.
 "Betera", Graedig answered, "You should be careful or I'll kill you too."
 Betst  look  at  Graedig  who  really  thought  that nobody would be able to do
anything  to  him,  because  he was the king.  Betst knew his father didn't kill
Graedig,  because he was too warm-hearted to kill anybody.  Betst didn't want to
be  worse  than his father, and he decided he wouldn't kill Graedig, and he said
to Bana:
 "Wake up, Bana.  Now, you're going to have a very valuable toy:  the king!  Who
wants  to  play  with  a jester, if there's a possibility to play with the king?
Look, Bana!  There he is waiting for you.  Take him!"
 "Bana!" Graedig shouted, "What are you doing?  I am the king!  Did you hear me?
The king!!!"
 "Bana  plays with the king!" Bana said, "Bana's better than the others who play
only with jesters!"
 But  Betst  didn't  want  to  see  what there was going to happen.  He left the
village and began to walk towards the Gleaw's tower.

 Finally Betst arrived in the tower where he told everything to Gleaw.
 "Great!" Gleaw said, "You haven't only saved your life, but you have also freed
Cynerice from the tyrant.  Still, you don't look like happy."
 "I'm  really  not happy", Betst said, "Why did Father lie?  Why did he say:  If
somebody wants to get the Magic Balls, everything he needs is in this bag."
 "I  have  no  idea", Gleaw said," But I'm sure he haven't lied.  He never lied.
What was in the bag?"
 "I don't know.  I didn't need to check it..." Betst said, but his sentence went
over like a lead balloon.
 "What  a fool have I been!" he finally said and took the Magic Balls out of the
bag.
