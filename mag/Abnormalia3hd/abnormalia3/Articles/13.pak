2                           By The Ripper of Nightfall


Sandro  was  watching  TV.  It was like every afternoon.  In fact he had already
studied  enough  and  he was really sick of books and copy-books.  He was fed up
with numbers and facts, and for the whole day he did not want to read more about
chemistry nor mathematic.
On  the  TV  there  was a show.  One of those shows full of smiling girls, those
girls  with  blond hair, a big and beautiful breast, perfect legs and blue eyes.
While  the  silly  showman  was  speaking  bullshit about some useless products,
created just to pump money from poor people, those blondie babies where dancing,
dancing  in a strange way.  They were dancing not so perfectly, as they sometime
were  out of the rhythm, but they were very convinced and while they were moving
their  body  in  a  way that could be defined at least erotic they were touching
their  breast.   They were dressing a tight bathing- suit, rather short, to tell
the  truth.  Sandro had saw a thousand of times these girls dancing in this way,
however  this time was more excited that the other times.  But together with the
excitement it was coming another sense.
An  undefined sense.  He decided to change channel.  He pushed the bottom of the
remote-control  and  immediately the dancing babies disappeared leaving place to
an  ugly man smoking a cigarette.  The man could be Yul Brinner and the film was
a  western,  one  of those seen plenty of times.  However Sandro was crazy about
westerns so he decided to watch Yul Brinner's actions.
After  some  minutes when there were already six men slaughtered by burning lead
the  film  stopped  for the usual advertisement.  This time a naked woman with a
perfect  body was smiling from a bathroom, she was washing her face and the rest
with  a  particular  soap,  which  was  the product to be advertised.  And again
Sandro  felt  some strange emotions.  He started to think about his girl-friend,
Luisa.   But  his  thoughts  soon  vanished  as he turned off the idiot box.  He
decided to have a breath of fresh air.  He rushed out into the street and caught
the bus.  He sat on a chair in the bus, as it was almost empty and there were no
old-women  who  could break balls about the fact he was young and the chairs are
for  old  people, as if only old people care allowed to be tired, and started to
watch  out  while  the  bus  was  going.  Out of the bus he could see the people
walking nervously, chatting and smiling.  The bus was going on.
The  traffic  was  heavy  for  a  while,  then,  when the vehicle took the Dante
Alighieri street it disappeared and the long wall of industries began.  Stuck on
the  wall  there  was  a  line  of  advertising posters.  One of them struck the
attention  of  our  Sandro.  It was again a naked girl, beautiful that, smiling,
was inviting people to use her sun-oil.  Sandro, almost like a sleepwalker, left
the  bus and started to watch the poster more careful.  And again it came to his
mind  Luisa.   His  mind  was  showing  her  naked, and immediately that strange
feeling  felt  before  came again out.  But this time he was able to rationalize
it.   It  was  a  sense of frustration.  Realizing the fact he was having a ugly
girl compared to the poster's one was terribly frustrating for him.
He  was  a  lamer,  after  all.  A loser.  The media were showing him that if he
wanted  to  be  happy he had to have a girl like these media show.  Otherwise he
should be a fluster.  The feeling was devastating his soul.  The fact of being a
loser  was  terrible.   He  could  not  bear  such a situation.  He ran for some
minutes  as  he reached a bridge.  A jump.  And all the feelings ended, even the
frustration.
