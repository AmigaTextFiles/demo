3                            THE VERY EVIL LAST WORDS


If  this  were  the  editorial of a common scene mag, it would contain pointless
comments  about  the  innovations  of  the  code, the need of more articles from
readers,  the  difference  of  this mag compared to all the other ones and inane
things of similar tone.

If  this were the final article of a common scene mag, it would reccomend you to
look  out  for the next issue in a pair of months, it would ask if you liked the
articles and it would stress that the mag needs more of them from the readers to
keep up the high standard.

If  this were a normal scene article of a common scene mag, it would hardly last
more than two or three Kbytes, it would comment very important and vital matters
about  the  ongoing  things in the scene and it would underline that it contains
just  the  author's  opinion who is terribly willing to hear other opinions from
other readers (an attempt to receive more articles which always fails).

This is the last article of Scenarium, instead, the most rotten and evil sub-mag
of  Abnormalia, therefore we are supposed to write some spandimerda ironic words
about whoever or whatever, trying to be funny and fooling also people we admire.

Nope. No hope (Take this one Billy!). We  would  like to specify here...
how we like and read many diskmags (which indeed are a big source of inspiration
  for our articles);
how we consider some demos real examples of modern days art;
how we admire the work of many talented guys who had also been mentioned in this
  mag (and if someone is mentioned here he has not much to be happy with) and
how we find funny to play the "guys in the scene".

We  would like to thank all the guys who work on productions which entertain and
  inspire us;
We  would  like  to  thank  the  ones  we  have spandimerded, with evil, ironic,
  sarcastic, terrible words;
We would like to thank the ones who have considered this mag a piece of spreaded
  shit, the ones who have disliked and hated it, the ones who have cried for it;
We  would  like  to thank God, for the skies and the seas, for the lands and the
  moon, for life and death, love and peace, men and especially women;
We  would  like finally to thank the Mummy, for having made the right thing that
  night.

And to the ones who have liked this magazine, 
to the ones who have smiled at the evil articles,
to the ones who have appreciated the style and the spirit,
to the ones who would like to read more issues of Scenarium,
to all these guys we would like to say, from the bone, from the heart...
... are u mad or what?


Well,  that's  enough.
Could you ever imagine such a moving and tender final article for Scenarium?
What's  the use of being ironic and evil if there aren't good things to do every
now and then, in order to make the bad ones more tasty?
These  are  the  final  words  of  Scenarium, words of friendlyness and words of
peace,  words  of  hope  and  words  of freedom, words for friends and words for
enemies, words for a better future...  for everybody...  soon...  better if now.

And never remember: 2Scenarium dares because it jokes.
