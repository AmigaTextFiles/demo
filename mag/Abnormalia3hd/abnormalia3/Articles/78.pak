    Welcome back, friends, for another episode of...

            AS THE CPU BURNS

the Amiga flamer community's favorite ongoing soap opera!

    But first, a word from our sponsor... heh heh...

    "AS THE CPU BURNS" is brought to you by BLAZEMONGER, INCORPORATED:
makers of fine games for self-destructive personalities.  Try BLAZEMONGER
today!  Then become HOPELESSLY ADDICTED, quit your JOB, and spend thousands
of dollars on SURGERY to have your EYEBALLS removed from the screen!!

    Now, back to the story!

    As you remember from last week, the Amiga was a total piece of crap
because it has no colors, blurry video, flakey hardware, buggy software, and
an incurable case of "Athlete's Mouse."  In a last-ditch attempt to make the
Amiga more visible, Commodore Marketing dug a big hole in the ground, filled
it with mud, and jumped in.  Critics called this a "bold move forward" and
were "cautiously optimistic" about the results.

    Meanwhile, in a town not far away, the Mac's System 7 was voted
"Best Operating System" by the Left-Handed Myopic High School Custodial
Society of Chickenmilk, Wisconsin.  Simultaneously, Steve Jobs announced
that the next NeXT computer will have a '486 processor and a new I/O system
made almost entirely of processed lunch meat.

    Also meanwhile, in a surprise move, IBM and Union Carbide teamed up
to create a new computer medium made entirely of chemical gases, eliminating
the need for disks and tapes.  This "Vaporware" (TM) reportedly will be
ready to ship "any day now."

    But some questions have STILL been left unanswered.  What's the best
computer to buy?  What's the best computer to RENT?  What's the best
computer to grind up and use as OINTMENT on a nasty burn?  Will the Amiga
ever catch up?  Does the Amiga taste good with ketchup?  How many NeXT's
does it take to screw in a lightbulb?  How many Macs does it take to screw
up an operating system?  Are 24-bit graphics on the horizon, or will they be
replaced by a hefty bonk on the head?  Does the previous sentence have ANY
MEANING AT ALL??  Why don't we get World Peace as a free prize inside our
breakfast cereal?  Is BLAZEMONGER *fast*???!?!??  GET REAL!!  BLAZEMONGER is
SO AMAZINGLY, BLINDINGLY, ASTOUNDINGLY LIGHTNING-FAST THAT...  that...
hey!!  Tell our "sponsors" to keep their propaganda in their OWN POSTINGS!
[Sorry about that! - B. Inc.]

    And what of the Toaster?  Does it SUCK?  Should the president of
NewTek be dipped in boiling pig fat and thrown into a pit of cobras?  Will he
find Irving Gould sitting next to him????

    Tune in tomorrow (and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and
tomorrow, ...) to hear the same arguments over and OVER and OVER AND OVER
again!!!!!!!




2A more efficient way to flame
3Written by Daniel J. Barrett  -  barrett@cs.umass.edu

Summary: BLAZEMONGER INC. strikes again!

Keywords: Flames great, less filling

    Boy, these "computer wars" sure take a lot of time!  I mean, I know
that everybody loves hearing why computer X is better than computer Y, but
think of all the EFFORT involved!  There are DOZENS of flamers working hard
to write LONG and ORIGINAL articles about issues that get argued OVER and
OVER again.  There MUST be a better way!

    There IS a better way!!

    [Rumble rumble]

    Introducing...

            P H R A S E M O N G E R

the FASTEST way to FLAME!

    Yes, PHRASEMONGER, the latest in a series of USEFUL yet HARMFUL
products from the creative cesspools of BLAZEMONGER INCORPORATED.
PHRASEMONGER is so AMAZINGLY, MIND-NUMBINGLY FAST that it can flame EVERY
POSTER in the comp.sys.amiga hierarchy in mere SECONDS!  Even by E-MAIL!!

    Did somebody just post an article that you HATED?  Did the poster
tell LIES, HALF-TRUTHS, or just plain BULL??  Did it make you ANGRY?!?!?  Do
you want to POST THE MOST VICIOUS, DAMAGING FLAME IN THE HISTORY OF
ELECTRONIC MEDIA, TOTALLY DESTROYING THE REPUTATIONS OF THE IDIOT POSTER AND
HIS MOTHER AND PET DOGGIE FOR ALL ETERNITY??!!!?!??!?!?!

    Well, in that case, I suggest that you get serious psychological help
immediately!  But for the REST of us, PHRASEMONGER is a quick way to FLAME
without having to work hard.  After all, isn't that what computers are for?

    Simply feed the offending USENET article into PHRASEMONGER, click on
the appropriate intensity gadget ("Disagree", "Disagree Strongly", "Hate",
"Maim", "Kill Lightly", "Dismember", "Puree", or "REALLY Not Nice"), and let
the program go to work!  Instantly, a customized FLAME is ready for your
posting pleasure.

    For example, suppose that Joe Flamebait has posted the following
article:

        From: flamebait@deadbeef.barbeque.edu
        Subject: Re: Re: Re: Mac vs. NeXT vs. Muhammed Ali
        Newsgroups: comp.sys.amiga.aversion

        In article <2938749@hot.ouch> scumface@barbie.ken.com
        writes:
        >Which should I buy?

        Buy a Mac.  It has a cute little trashcan.  Much better than
        the nasty NeXT "black hole."  And besides, I am such an
        expert on these two machines that I think I'll post it in an
        Amiga newsgroup so everybody can be enlightened.
        ---
        Joe Flamebait, flamebait@deadbeef.barbeque.edu
        No matter where you go, there's a stupid quote!

    Feed it to PHRASEMONGER, click on the "Half-Intensity" gadget, and
look what comes out!!

        Mac?  MAC?!?  Are you OUT OF YOUR MIND!?!??!?  You OBVIOUSLY
        have NO IDEA what you're talking about!  The NeXT?!?  GET A
        LIFE!!  Both of these machines are INEPT at best, incapable
        even of picking the CORNS on my TOES.  And don't even
        *mention* Multifinder... oh, no.  What a JOKE.

        The Mac *belongs* in the very TRASH CAN that it displays.
        The NeXT should get SUCKED into a black hole itself.
        And you, Mr. Smarty-Pants, should be fed to rabid wolves.

        And next time, buddy, keep it in your OWN NEWSGROUP!!!
        ---
        <Your name or pseudonym here>

    Not bad, eh?  But that's not ALL!  You don't even have to give
PHRASEMONGER the original article!  Just type in a few key words or phrases,
and PHRASEMONGER will give you a perfect flame ANYWAY!

    Example 1:

        Input:  Apple, Irving Gould, CDTV
        Gadget: "Maim"

        Output: "You misbegotten Apple employees don't know what
            you're TALKING ABOUT!  This is TOTAL and UTTER
            BULLSHIT!!!  CDTV can run RINGS around the Mac IIfx
            ANY DAY OF THE WEEK!!  Get the HELL off of the NET!!!

                        Love,
                        Irving Gould"

    Example 2:

        Input:  asdf4
        Gadget: "Embarrass"

        Output: "WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!!!!!!!  No matter
            HOW you say it, your INFORMATION is COMPLETELY
            without content!  I refer you to chapter 4 of the
            ROM KERNEL MANUAL so you can see how BRAINLESS your
            comment was.  No, I won't tell you the PAGE NUMBER,
            you mamby-pamby little CREEP."

    Now that you've seen PHRASEMONGER at work, a natural question you
might ask is:  "How does PHRASEMONGER do it?"  To answer that question,
let's feed it to PHRASEMONGER (at various intensity levels) and find out!!

        Input:  "How does PHRASEMONGER do it?"

        Gadget: Somewhat Friendly
        Output: "BLAZEMONGER INC. has the ULTIMATE programmers.
            They can do ANYTHING, you little dweeb."

        Gadget: Medium
        Output: "We don't give out TRADE SECRETS for FREE, you
            MOOCHER.  Write your OWN damn program."

        Gadget: Destructive
        Output: "By kidnapping your MOTHER and doing IRRESPONSIBLE
            ACTIONS with a garden hose."

    Wheee!!!  Obviously this program has lots of POTENTIAL.  It is hoped
that PHRASEMONGER will provide the ULTIMATE in high-temperature
entertainment for YEARS to come!!  Get your copy now at finer software
stores everywhere.  But be sure to wear gloves when opening the box....


PS: WARNING!  Judging from the content of some of the recent articles in
    this newsgroup, it is obvious that some buggy "beta" copies of
    PHRASEMONGER have leaked out onto USENET.  Beware!




2Angry, angry, angry... gee whiz, am I angry!
3Written by Daniel J. Barrett  -  barrett@cs.umass.edu

Summary: A BLAZEMONGER a day keeps the FLAMERS away

Keywords: Beethoven, concrete, petunias, tattooed knockwurst

    Hey!  Have you ever sent e-mail to someone, and then found out that
your e-mail was POSTED to the Net without your permission?

    Did this make you angry??

    Very angry??

    Very, very, VERY ANGRY???

    ANGRY ENOUGH to take STEEL TWEEZERS and FORCEFULLY PIERCE the
CHEEKS of the IDIOT RAPSCALLION WHO DID IT?!?!?!??!?

    Well then, we have GREAT NEWS for you!!!

    Introducing...

               P H R A S E M O N G E R     I I

the latest entry in BLAZEMONGER, INCORPORATED's "ViolentWare" series!

    They said it couldn't be done.  "Improve PHRASEMONGER??" they
gasped.  "It's already the PERFECT way to create EFFICIENT and DEVASTATING
FLAMES!!"  Well, that just shows you what DWEEBS "they" are.  We have
taken the ULTIMATE ELECTRONIC FLAME PROGRAM and turned it into... into...
yes... the ULTIMATE *ULTIMATE* ELECTRONIC FLAME PROGRAM!!!!!  (How's THAT
for progress??)

    For those people out there who have never heard of PHRASEMONGER,
here are a few words of introduction, to help you out.

        YOU STUPID, BRAINLESS MORON!!
        DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING?!?!?!

Whoops!!  Sorry about that!!  We tried to write a polite and helpful answer,
but PHRASEMONGER II took control of the keyboard!  We'll try again.

    As described a few weeks ago, PHRASEMONGER was developed to make
flaming more efficient.  Simply feed in the offending USENET article, and
PHRASEMONGER automatically generates and posts a specially-tailored FLAME to
toast your hated opponent, uh, I mean the other person.  For example,
suppose you saw the following SUGGESTIVE and HIGHLY OFFENSIVE article posted
in your favorite newsgroup:

        Article 5873 of rec.flowers
        From: mark@liberty.ads.edu (Mark Pern)
        Subject: Re: Petunia gardens in Southern France

        In article <239487.8@nice.com>, mary@vax.nice.com writes:
        >Next time you are in Paris, you simply MUST check out
        >the Tuilleries, the roses are just fab...

        Oh yes, definitely!  I was there in the Summer of '89
        and just fell in love with the place.  Those high-walled
        rock gardens and statues just blew me away!

Well, you aren't just going to SIT THERE and TAKE this stuff, are you?!?
No WAY!!!  Let PHRASEMONGER generate an "appropriate" reponse...

        From: testosterone@really.big.one (Don't Fuck With Me)
        Subject: Re: Re: Petunia gardens up my ass
        In-Response-To: moron@liberace.aids.edu (Infantile Pervert)
        Newsgroups: rec.flowers, talk.abortion, comp.laser-printers
        Followup-To: rec.music.jazz, alt.jesus

        In article <3847@who.cares>, some dickhead writes:
        >[useless sniveling deleted]

        Mork, you DROOLING CREEP, you don't know the FIRST THING
        about rock gardens.  You wouldn't know a DAISY if it WALKED
        RIGHT UP TO YOU and BIT OFF YOUR BUTT!  In fact, that's
        EXACTLY what would happen -- you see, flowers HATE you.
        They WHISPER secrets about you when you aren't listening.
        So get the HELL off the Net, and take your damn POSIES
        with you.

                        Love and kisses,
                        Your mother's pimp


    Now THAT was effective, wasn't it?  And now, things are even BETTER
because PHRASEMONGER II is NEW and IMPROVED over the old version!  Look at
all these great new features!

    o   AUTO-FLAME mode!  Yes, you don't even have to sit at your
        terminal anymore to post great flames!  Just connect an
        "Auto-Fire" joystick, and PHRASEMONGER II will begin posting
        responses to EVERY USENET ARTICLE it sees!  Use the
        "Slander" option to make PHRASEMONGER post in the names of
        well-known USENET personalities!

    o   WMAILSPLIT mode!  Generate THOUSANDS of USELESS and ANNOYING
        articles automatically!!

    o   SUPERUSER mode!  Connect your PHRASEMONGER-II-equipped Amiga
        to any UNIX machine.  It will automatically grab ALL THE
        UNREAD E-MAIL on the disk, ERASE it, and replace it with
        WARPED and TWISTED versions of the original messages!

    o   REVENGE mode!  If somebody posts your e-mail for everybody
        to see, PHRASEMONGER II will automatically set up an E-MAIL
        LOOP that causes your original letter to be sent back to
        the offender over and over and OVER and OVER...!  And the
        versions keep getting worse, and worse, and WORSE...!

        But it's not done yet!  PHRASEMONGER II then monitors USENET
        to see if the offender posts a public apology to you!  And
        if he/she does, PHRASEMONGER II immediately responds with a
        CRISPY, RED-HOT FLAME that REJECTS the STUPID APOLOGY and
        makes RUDE and DIRTY REMARKS about the offender's BODILY
        PARTS!

    o   GYNECOLOGY mode!!  We won't even TELL you what THIS does!!


    So make sure to run out to your local dealer and purchase
PHRASEMONGER II right away!  If you DON'T, then... then... then... well,
heck, I don't know.  Let's ask PHRASEMONGER II:

        If you don't BUY a copy of me IMMEDIATELY, CRAZED
        RADIOACTIVE DEATH VULTURES will RIP the very FLESH from your
        FAT, SLOVENLY CARCASS!!

Yeah, that's it.


ps: Can you tell I have a big assignment due? :-)




2Finally: a SOLUTION for all the flames in c.s.a.advocacy
3Written by Daniel J. Barrett  -  barrett@cs.umass.edu

Keywords: flames, third degree burns, get the marshmallows

    Maybe you haven't noticed, but flames and nasty remarks are starting
to pop up again all over the c.s.a. hierarchy.  We have HAM-E flames in
c.s.a.graphics, "Future of Amiga" flames in c.s.a.misc, modem flames in
c.s.a.datacomm, and other violations.  It is time for us to realize that the
flamers cannot be confined to just the "advocacy" newsgroup.  What can be
done about this?

    I have a simple and efficient solution:  let's turn ALL the
newsgroups into flame groups!  Yes!!  A few simple name-changes, and we
can have a whole hierarchy of anger and hate!!!  Wheee, won't that be FUN?
Here is my complete proposal for new groups to replace the existing (and
similar sounding) ones!

(1) comp.sys.amiga.myth

    The "general talk" Amiga group.  Hints, rumors, legends, nitpicks,
    minor falsehoods, small crimes, outright lies, etc.

(2) comp.sys.amiga.anonymous

    Moderated.  USENET people and Amiga vendors will submit the most
    awful stuff they can think of.  The moderator will accept the
    juiciest ones and post them anonymously, or in the names of
    well-known Net personalities.  (Of course, the moderator's name and
    e-mail address would be kept secret.)

(3) comp.sys.amiga.refused

    Moderated.  All submissions are immediately rejected by the
    moderator.  Nothing is ever posted here.

(4) comp.sys.amiga.introspection

    Frequently asked questions, such as "why I am I reading News,"
    "what else could I be doing that is more productive," and
    "where can I find psychological help to break my USENET addiction."

(5) comp.sys.amiga.hardcore

    For true, die-hard flamers.  Yell and scream about the latest
    hardware mistakes and technical errors, and how you could have done
    it 100 times better and 10 times quicker, for 5 percent of the
    cost.

(6) comp.sys.amiga.programs

    Fanatical discussion of Amiga appearances on television shows.

(7) comp.sys.amiga.gams

    Flames containing sexist remarks.

(8) comp.sys.amiga.multimediator

    With all this flaming going on, SOMEBODY has to try to make peace.
    This is the group where people can volunteer to reconcile the
    differences between opposing flamers.

(9) comp.sys.amiga.supplications

    The official forum for begging and pleading to Commodore for
    the latest OS and hardware advances.

(10)    comp.sys.amiga.marketingplace

    Flames and more flames against Commodore's marketing department.
    A traffic limit of 32,768 posts per day will be imposed to prevent
    USENET sites from running out of disk space.

(11)    comp.sys.amiga.auditor

    Screams and complaints against Irving Gould's high salary.

(12)    comp.sys.amiga.adversary

    The pits of Hell.  The slime of the earth.  Yes, here are found
    the worst of the worst, the lowest of the low, the flamingest
    of the flamers.  Enter and die immediately.  You have been warned.

(13)    comp.sys.amiga.dad&mom

    After reading through all the other groups, your brain is wasted
    and your body sore.  Come to this newsgroup for sympathy, a kiss
    on the cheek, and a hot dinner.

and, of course:

(14)    comp.sys.amiga.BLAZEMONGER

    Discussion of important Amiga software, hardware,
    programming, games, applications, multimedia, audio,
    telecommunications, and other related topics.


Well, what does everybody think?  Should we do it?  Personally, I think it's
time to face reality and convene this Grand Reorganization ((C) Kent@Xanth)
as soon as possible!
