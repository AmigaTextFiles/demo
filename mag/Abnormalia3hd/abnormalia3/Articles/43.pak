What is a falling leaf?
A  piece of tree that goes away.  Used and rejected, it flies down to the earth,
waving in the autumnal air, grazing the eyes of clean and unaware children.
It touches the wet ground, it lays down and there it rests.
Forever.
Destined to decay under the steps of time.

It was just a little green leaf.
It  has  done  its  duty, I saw it for the whole summer, showing her back to the
sun,  breathing  its  light,  knowing  the inner secrets of nature, transforming
molecules and energies.
Sometimes  it used to sparkle and to dance with the morning breath, it seemed to
smile at the sky and to grin ironically at the whole mass of humanity.

The leaf was there, tied to the tree in front of my window
There the biggest of this world's arcane was living.
There  it  transformed light into food, solar radiations to change the structure
of  few  basic  molecules.   I  studied  its  work,  on  dull books I read about
photosynthesis  and  chlorophyll,  I knew everything about it, the passages, the
compounds, the reactions, the catalysts, the molecular structures.
I knew everything about that leaf, except how it could do it.

This  leaf  has  made possible my life, in this shape and in this time, the leaf
brings into its tomb the secret of the sun, of organic life, of existence.
While  we are here, toiling to live and to breath some seconds more, looking for
food  and  moving  and spending energies to fill them again, the leaf just stays
there, unmoved, without reason to hurry or to be worried.
It has understood the right way of living and reproducing.

The leaf is falling down.  It has completed its work and it's going to turn into
dust.  Final and obvious task of every kind of living being of the planet.
Maybe just man hasn't understood that he is here to become dust and disappear.
That's the only relevant certainty.

The  leaf  is  on the ground and it was on the tree, but it doesn't really exist
and it has never existed.
It was just one of my mental categories, one of the schemes mankind has built to
describe the reality it can observe.
The  leaf  exists  only  in  my  mind  and in the mind of every man, it's just a
simplification, an image, a part of a classification.
We  seize  reality  and we give it different names, we call a tree and we define
leaves,  roots, flowers and fruits, at the end we are so used to call and define
them  in  that  way,  for the simple fact that our whole culture defines them in
that way, that we really think they actually exist.

The  leaf  is  real  only  in our minds, it never exists in a reality outside my
senses.
We  are  so good in making classes and genres, in dividing and classifying, that
we always forget our same work.

Does it really matter?
It's all going to die in the dust.
But dust, like the leaf, doesn't exist, it's just a category of our cultures.
Maybe there's really nothing, after.
Neither some comfortable, warm dust.
