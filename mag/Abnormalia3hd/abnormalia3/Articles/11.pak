Over  two  months Christopher Columbus had sailed from Spain, and now he finally
sighted  a  land  in  front  of  him.   He  kneeled  down,  praised the Lord and
proclaimed  to seize this continent for their Catholic Majesties.  But he didn't
mention  that he would become the governor.  Then he rowed to the beach where he
saw people who lay in the sand.  One black man approached him.
"Yo man", the black man said, "Are you making a movie here?"
"No",  Columbus  said,  "We  came  to  conquer this continent for their Catholic
Majesties of Spain."
"Hah!"  the black man laughed, "A dumb answer for a dumb question!  Sure you are
making a movie here..."
"What  are you talking about, you stupid savage?!?" Columbus shouted angrily and
took  his  sword,  "Do  you want to get some of this?  Bring me all your gold or
I'll destroy your insignificant culture!"
"Come on, man", the black man said, "You really seem to be a good actor..."
But Columbus didn't want to listen anymore.  That insolent savage didn't respect
him  -  the  governor  of  the  continent.  That's the reason why he had to die.
Columbus  ordered  one of his soldiers to execute the black man.  When the other
lifesavers  noticed what there was going to happen, they tried to help, but they
had  to  take  to  their heels, when they saw the shiny swords of the strangers.
One  of  the  lifesavers  tried  to  call the police, but he had big problems to
convince them.  So the policemen finally arrived too late.

After  the  execution  Columbus and his soldiers noticed that they were alone on
the beach.
"These  people  seem  to be quite cowardly", Columbus said scornfully, "Well, it
makes our job easier.  Now we'll have find the Great Chan."
They  left  the  beach  and  saw  some buildings in the horizon.  When they came
nearer,  they  saw  that  the  buildings were higher than any of Spanish castles
which they had seen before.
"The  Great  Chan must live there", Columbus said and didn't know that they were
only  some  ordinary  hotels  where  the  rich  Americans  used  to  spend their
vacations.   "Let's  go  to meet him and exchange these glassy necklases for his
gold!" he said and joined in the laughing of his soldiers.

When Columbus approached the city, he heard some strange sound.  Suddenly he saw
a  moving  chariot  without  horses  which drove past.  His soldiers paniced and
began to run toward the beach.
"Stop,  fools!"  Columbus  shouted, but he couldn't prevent them.  Of course, he
was  surprised  by  the strange chariot, but he was even more angry, because his
soldiers  hadn't  obeyed  him - the governor of the continent.  Now he had to go
visit  the Great Chan without his bodyguards.  How dishonorable!  But he kept on
with  his  exploration.   At the same time his fellow travelers decided to set a
course due east, and they sailed to Spain where nobody believed their story, and
finally the Catholic Majesties proclaimed officially that the earth was flat.

But  Columbus  marveled at all the wonders which he saw.  Now he knew that Marco
Polo  was  right  when he said:  "I haven't tell even half of the wonders in the
east." Columbus saw an uniformed man in front of one building.
"Officer!"  Columbus  ordered,  "Take  me  immediately to the court of the Great
Chan!"
"The  Great Chan?" the doorman asked, "Oh, you liked to see the Great Chan.  Who
may I inform?"
"I am the governor of this continent", Columbus answered.
"I  see.   Excuse  me", the doorman said and went inside the building.  Columbus
waited  impatiently,  until  the doorman came back and said:  "I'm sorry for the
delay.  The Great Chan will come soon."
"That  sounds better", Columbus said and smiled proudly.  Soon he heard the same
sound which he had heard earlier.
"The Great Chan is coming", the doorman said.
"Oh, I thought he would be in this palace", Columbus said.
"Really?"  the  doorman said, "The Great Chan has a very much bigger palace than
this."
"Wow!"  Columbus  said  and  saw again a chariot without horses.  Two men in the
white jackets came out of the ambulance.
"Here he is", the doorman said and bursted into laughter, "The governor."
"Wait a minute!" Columbus said, "Where's the Great Chan?"
"We'll take you to his court, Your Highness", the ambulance driver said.
"All right", Columbus said, "Let's go."

Soon  Columbus  sat  in the padded room with Caesar, Napoleon and God.  He had a
feeling  that he had been cheated.  But that wasn't true.  He was only 500 years
too late.
