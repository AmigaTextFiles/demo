2                           By The Ripper of Nightfall


Mary  Ann Nicholls was very depressed and in a bad mood as she was living one of
her  worst periods of her life.  She was forty-two and she was getting older and
unable to catch the attentions of men, as she did years before.
She  was  even unable to find four pence, the cost of a bed and a dinner, as she
was spending the rest of her money buying gin, her only friend.
The  night was cold, also if it was Summer.  In the gray and narrow street where
she  was  walking  there  were only a couple of cats, seeking for food, but soon
they  disappeared  through  a  hole in a wall.  Mary was not drunk, at least not
that  moment.   She  was  wondering why she had to bear such a life, a dirty and
useless life.
She was thinking about the past.  When she was young; her mother always busy and
in  search  for a job, her father never seen.  She knew only that her father was
an  actor,  one  of  those  that  travel  the  Continent.  She dreamt to marry a
nobleman,  a  Landlord, who could bring her to a better life.  A great castle as
home,  with plenty of waiters and maids, ready to ask her what she would like to
have  and  to  be served.  But, as she was getting a pretty girl, she understood
she  could survive only selling her body, to the one who could offer money.  She
did not want to do it, as she perfectly knew it was immoral, and also shameless,
but  it  was  the  only way to survive.  She had passed a good time when she was
about  twenty.   She  looked like a pretty girl.  She had a beautiful breast and
great  legs, also if they were always covered, like the belly of course.  In the
age she was living a woman with naked legs could be sent to jail.  How could you
show  to  people your legs when even the legs of the tables were covered because
of the fear of sin?  Hypocrisy.  Yes, they were all a bunch of hypocrites.  Also
her  customers were hypocrites but they provided her with the money, and so they
had to be respected, also if they did not deserve respect.
While  she  was  under  these thoughts a man closed her.  He smiled at her.  She
answered at the smile, thinking that, at least, she had find an occasion to have
a  dinner.   The  man  did not say anything but took her hand and whisper her to
follow him.  She nodded and started to follow.
In the dark street she could hear only their steps, and when the man turned into
a  little  alley she was not afraid.  She had known stranger people who liked to
have sex in stranger places than a dark and dirty alley.

'Oh God! Who could have done this?' said Inspector Lordon
'I don't know! It had to be a surgeon! Look! The body is perfectly dissected!'
 answered Dr. Tomphson
'It's one of the worst crime I've ever seen! Oh God! Oh God!'
While  the  two  men were looking at the poor mass of meat that once ago was the
body of Mary Ann Nichols one policeman was writing as report:

- Mary Ann Nichols, a homeless woman, has been murdered.
  A young boy found his body horribly mutilated.
  The author of the crime is still nameless.

London, East End     August 31st 1888
