              2By L.U.P.O (independent) and The Ripper of Nightfall


It was the time of the 'Gold Rush', not the Sierra's game, but the real one.
The  one  made  by  pioneers and trappers, by lead and gold.  Toppertown was the
headquarter of this fever, but it was rather quiet, to tell the truth.
Scarcely  ever  had  a single notable event disturbed the dull collection of the
wooden  buildings.   Never  was  a fight known to start there and seldom did the
police need to use the dark and rotten jail.
You  could  then  imagine  the  great and universal consternation when the local
newspaper  editor  (American Chronicle report us the name of this hero was Macno
or  Marcio  or  Marcno,  we  do not know the right spell) rushed into the saloon
puffing  and shouting.  Hardly ever had he been seen to walk quickly, or better,
to  run.   The  message  he  brought shook and shocked the customers of the bar.
'Jack  the  Scarface, is coming to town at twelve o'clock!' he screamed.  'HE is
coming at midday!'
So  great  was  the  fear  that  chairs  were overturned and bottles and glasses
smashed  in the rush to get out of the bar.  Everybody knew that a man who stood
in the very same room as Jack the Scarface was in mortal danger.
Everyone  was  frightened.   Boys  playing in the street were compelled to enter
their  home  while men and women were closing doors and windows.  Even the birds
in  the  sky  were  so  frightened  that they were all under the branches of the
biggest tree of the town, in the place they thought it was the safer.
At  quarter  to  twelve  the whole village of Topper was empty.  The dusty roads
were  quiet  and there were no flies nor mosquitoes popping around.  Ten minutes
to midday.
A  horse  raised  a  cloud  of  dust  as  it  went down the dirty road, entering
Toppertown.   The  horse drew up and the rider dropped off.  It came a huge man,
dressing a leather coat and a dusty hat.  He was carrying two colts and he had a
great scarf on his face.  He smashed some glasses which were on the ground.
He  asked for some whisky to the trembling barman, staring at him with contempt.
The barman could hardly pour the drink, so scared was he.
'There  goes  half a bottle of whisky on the floor', said the big stranger.  The
big man just laughed, drank the tumbler full of whisky and asked for another.
He  drank  two more after that and then he grabbed an entire bottle and drank it
down.   The  barman  was  looking  at  the dirty, unshaven man in awe.  Under no
circumstances  would  he  have dared to speak but the stranger looked at him and
asked  rudely  why he was staring at him.  'I did not want to be impolite, sir',
he  quivered.   'Least of all would I stare at you.  I just wondered if there is
anything else you would like'.
'No, thanks', the stranger answered.  'I'm late.  I've got to get out of town as
soon as possible because Jack the Scarface is getting here at midday!'
