I  am  dying.  I know it.  I feel it.  Every part of my body is counting my last
seconds on this white, warm, comfortable bed.
I  have lived enough, sure, at a certain age you have to cohabit with death.  It
can  happen  at  any  time, an organic malfunction and you are gone, too weak to
bear.
Maybe at a certain point death becomes a real liberation, forced on this bed for
weeks  life  hasn't  been  that  worth.   Outside  the  window  I  hear children
screaming,  running,  playing,  under  the  sun rays, which try to enter in this
room, through the closed shutter, hoping to light this dark room.
Few  seconds  and  everything is gone, faded away, disappeared, ceased to exist.
What  will  happen  then?   There's  no  reason to be curious now, after so many
years of life is pointless to wonder what is death.

It's  time  to  make balances, time to consider things, to decide if it has been
worth.  What have I done?  What will I leave?
Few minutes ago I told my relatives to leave me alone.  I want to face it alone.
Will  they  suffer  for  my  departure?  I suppose so, they will be sad for some
days,  even  if  announced, prepared, declared, death is always something tragic
and unbelievable, inconceivable, for the living ones.
In  a  month  their  life  will be like before, with few seconds of sad thoughts
every  now  and  then.   That's  right, death is the most common thing, it can't
destroy other lives.
And  the  world?   Have  I  left  a  trace of me on it?  No, seems not.  Another
anonymous man is leaving it, almost nobody will notice him.
Death must be something intimate, nothing and nobody must interphere.  It leaves
you  alone,  the  rest,  all  the  other  things,  in  a  while,  lose all their
importance.  We go, nothing remains, nothing to care of any more.

What life have I left behind me?  Can I be happy or proud of it?
I  have  made two new human beings, I have made my natural task.  Does something
else  matter?   Yes,  it  does.   Two  children  are  not  enough  to justify an
existence.  I have been good, I have been evil sometimes, I have been honest and
sometimes  I  cheated.   I  have had my good moments, my joyful times, my strong
emotions,  my  satisfactions.   I  have  had delusions, pangs, frustrations, sad
periods.   I  have  travelled a bit, not much, I have seen some other countries,
meet  some other cultures.  Nothing particular, I have always had my roots in my
home  town,  where I was born, where I lived and where I am dying.  Always here,
my  life has been always here.  In this room I lived half of my life, in another
house  all  my  youth.   The  same  streets  have changed, I have seen buildings
growing  and  decaying,  people  coming  and  going away.  I have known friends,
mates,  many  other  people.   Some  disappeared,  never seen again, not for any
particular  reason, I just greeted them a day and then we never had the occasion
to  meet  again.   Some  will  be  surprised at the news of my death.  Maybe old
school  mates,  remembering  the old times, the jokes, the things made together.
At  this  age  we  are all resigned, I have seen friends going before me, I have
heard, always a bit sad and surprised, of the death of others, who I had forgot.
It  is  really  true, things change with time, they change a lot, radically, but
you  don't  notice it, you don't realize it, the process is slow and continuous,
it  can  have accelerations that leave you shocked for a while, but soon also to
the new situation you get used.  When you leave your youth, when you become man,
when  you are old, you never realize it, slowly you become and the process can't
be  grabbed  and  fixed in a single moment.  So is for death, when it's natural,
like  mine,  it  just  comes, almost unnoticed, it is just something to be done,
normal and right.

Have  I  complaints  and  regrets?  Yes, many.  I still think at all those times
when  I wanted to do something and I just stood still, remaining inactive, maybe
worried for the consequences.
There  is  a  thing which I always have fixed in my mind, never forgotten, which
now  makes  me  smile  with  the superiority of who hasn't anything to lose, but
which still aches, in a subtle, soft way.
I was young and I was in love.  She was beautiful, perfect at my eyes.  I looked
her, I dreamed her, every thought of my mind was for her.  A night, at a dancing
place,  I  saw  her  alone,  sitting at a table.  I knew she wasn't engaged with
anybody,  I  knew she was alone, I was there, looking her, wondering if I had to
get closer and start to talk, to make a resolute step.
I  stood  still,  paralyzed,  I didn't find the courage to move and to grasp the
occasion.   Then a boy sat at her side, they started to talk and smile and laugh
under my impotent and resigned eyes and a week later they were together.
I  never  forgot that.  A far, ancient fact who has remained like a knife's cold
wound  in  my  heart  for  many years.  Not for that particular girl but for the
wasted  occasion,  for the fact that I could grab something and I stood still, I
could attempt and I didn't dare.

Yes, if I could change something of my life now I would live back that night, to
see again that girl sitting alone and to go and talk and try.
Just  try,  whatever  the  result.  A possible success or failure doesn't matter
now, what aches is the lost occasion, the wasted second.
"Waiting for a placid death on a hospital death", I wrote many years ago, when I
still  could  do  things,  and  do of my life what I wanted my life to be, but I
passed those times listening to the lyrics of Time, enjoying the seconds ticking
away,  knowing  that  I  was  losing  them, almost pleased by the desperation in
seeing  them disappearing, without the hope or the will or the force to grab one
and live it.

How  many seconds have passed?  How many of them have I lived?  My life has been
a bunch of lost seconds, a death alone in a dark room is the right conclusion.
