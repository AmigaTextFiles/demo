There's an hidden dream in every man.
The hope of individuality, the goal of originality.
We  think  to have something special, to be different from normality, to be just
the  result  of  our very personal genetic pools, we never dare to think to be a
mass of sheep following idols and tasks of different nature.
It may be for the fact that we are so used to our body and our mind, that we are
so  closely  tied  to  them,  because  we ARE them, it may be for a more or less
innate  sense  of  individuality,  related to our genetical surviving, it may be
just  for a badly hidden sense of superiority, it may be for something else, but
we often think to be unique and different human beings.

A necessary dream, it feeds our existence, it may give it a meaning.
How  could  we  face  the  evidence  that  we are just the image of many others,
without  relevant  differences,  without  the possibility of making of ourselves
something special?
Divinity  is  a  prize  given  to somebody else, we are just humanity and in our
humanity  we  often  drown, transported by the river of the common thought which
builds our same mental categories.
We  think  with  the  mind of our culture, we see with its eyes, we act with its
customs  (I  mean  culture  in  a  quite  wide  way,  we can also spot different
sub-cultures, which mix and overlay themselves existing at the same time).
Put a botanist and an electrician in front of a field of grass.
The  former  will  distinguish different species, he will understand the kind of
climate,  soil,  human  impact on that place.  He will see hundreds of different
things where the electrician will see just a green field of grass.
Their  knowledge  is  different  and  different  is  the eye with which they see
reality.   Put them in front of a electric panel.  Here the botanists can't even
know where to put his hands but the electrician immediately understands what are
the  parts  to  consider,  to check, to repair, he sees connections and contacts
where the other sees just a mass of wires.
The  differences  in our mental schemes, which influence our whole vision of the
world  (the  botanic  will see reality in a way different from the electrician's
one,  their  own  particular knowledge has influences not only in their specific
fields),  are  not due only to education (intended in quite a wide way, not only
with the scholastic meaning), they are influenced also by the same language.
Put an Italian in Lappland, he just sees around some snow, he has only a word to
indicate  the snow, the Lapp has more than forty ways of addressing to different
kinds of snow.  Differences that the italian can't even notice.
Our  languages  influence  our  way  of  seeing reality, the reason after all is
obvious,  languages  are  connected  to  cultures  and cultures are connected to
languages!   There's  a  dynamic  relation between them and they both inevitably
influence our mental schemes and processes.

Too  often  we  consider  language  just  a mean of communication and not a real
system  of  relations  and  interpretations of reality which influences our same
attitude towards it.
The  same  reality, after all, it's not something univocal and fixed, it changes
according to the eyes and the minds who see it.
The new Science's philosophy theories have rejected the inductivistic idea of an
unique  Reality  which  can  be  described  in  an  unique way by the scientific
disciplines.
It  is  now  clear  for every scientist that Science just gives a description of
reality,  this  description  belongs  to the human way of considering it, not to
Reality as if it had a fixed and universal structure.
If  somebody  tells  you  that the dog doesn't exist he isn't joking at all.  Of
course there is the material substance that is part of the "object" we call dog,
but  that's  just  a  distinction  and  division made by humans.  The concept of
species  is something built by men, it's has an own definition (two living forms
belong  to  the  same  species  if  they have similar morphologic and biological
characters  and  if,  reproducing themselves, obtain a fecund descent), it's not
something  inside Nature.  It's mankind that, in order to organize and to give a
structure  to  his  interpretation of his world, has divided the living forms in
different  species.   A  division  completely arbitrary, we could divide them in
many other ways.
The  power  of  science  is  to  try  to  give  formal and systematic MODELS and
explanations of Reality, but it uses structures invented by men, for this reason
we can't say that there is only a science that can inductivistically bring us to
the knowledge of Reality.
Also  for  this  reason  we  see  the  world  with  the eyes of our sciences and
therefore we can't pretend to give it an unique, universal aspect.

I  started  this  writing  talking  about  how our language and cultural schemes
influence our vision of the world, then I continued referring to science and its
own description of the world, what are the conclusions then?
Simply  that  there  is a different reality for everyone of us, not because it's
something  subjective  but  because  we  can  only  know it in a subjective way,
meaning  with  this  that  we  see  it  with  different  mental  eyes, which are
influenced  by  our  cultures (more or less wide, science is worth for the whole
Earth,  language  for our own country...), by our studies, by all the systems of
knowledge that have been around us in our life.
These  systems  of knowledge are not just scientific ones, also the culture of a
little  agricultural  village  is  a system of knowledge that influences whoever
lives in the village.
The  worst part is that often we are so used to our systems of knowledge that we
think  that  they are natural and universal, forgetting that they are just parts
of the cultures or subcultures which we have received and integrated.
This  integration is not only a passive process, where we are just influenced by
whatever  can  influence us, it's also active, because everybody integrates just
some  particular  parts  of  the  external flood of influences, according to his
previous  ideas, his same mental schemes and generally by what he PREVIOUSLY had
integrated.  A process without end and with undefined beginning, as you may see,
which somehow doesn't exclude a genetical component.
This  brings  us  back  to  the  eternal diatribe between genetical and cultural
influences on the single being.
To  consider  this problem supporting a side or the other is simply wrong, as it
often  happens,  there  isn't a single clear solution to these kind of problems,
both  the  parts  have  their  importance,  even  if  in  my  opinion (obviously
influenced by my education) the cultural conditioning can easily superimpose the
genetical  one, which still exists, elsewhere we would all have exactly the same
genotype.
