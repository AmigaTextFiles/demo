2                           by The Ripper of Nightfall


There's a field. A long field covered by green grass.
I'm  running,  not  very  fast,  to  tell  the truth, but as fast as I can.  I'm
desperately following a ball.  Together with me there are twenty one boys.  Nine
of  them  dress like me, or better, they dress a t-shirt with the same colors as
my own one.
It's white and blue, short trousers, white sockets (easy to be filthy by the wet
mud).   There's  also one boy who's hoping I will catch the ball, but, strangely
he's  not dressed like me.  He has got a couple of gloves and a different colour
t-shirt;  nevertheless the design looks like mine.  Other ten boys would like to
have  the  ball  I'm trying to reach before me.  There's still another guy who's
walking  nervously  close  to a strange thing.  It's like a monolite made by two
wooden posts and a third one on the other two.
I'm realizing that in the field there are twenty-two dudes.  But there's another
one.   He's all dark but his skin.  He has got a whistle in his mouth, among his
lips.   This green field is surrounded by people screaming and shouting things I
can not always understand, almost never.
But I don't care about that.  It does not matter.  The important thing is that I
have  to run faster.  Step by step I'm reaching the ball.  Suddendly with a fast
move  of  the  foot, however like a soft caress, I move the ball, just a little,
but  that's enought to put it safe from the upcoming boy that was trying to kick
the  ball away from me.  It takes a couple of second then I rise my head to have
a  complete  look, an overview of the field.  On the left I'm still looking at a
friend  of  mine.   A  powerful  kick and the ball is flying over the heads of a
bunch of kids, directly on the foot of the boy I was looking before.  Nice pass,
the crowd is shouting and clapping.
He  controls the ball softly, and, in front of a scared goal-keeper he kicks the
ball.  Easy goal.

I'm  feeling  better,  I  don't  know why.  I have not done anything, I have not
written something very brilliant nor said something very clever, I have not done
anything  that  could  help  the  human  being in his sad and hard life, but I'm
happy,  very happy, really happy.  I did not found the medicine against the AIDS
virus, I'm not the first man on Mars nor a popular singer in a live concert.
I  simply  passed  a ball to a friend of mine and he scored, in a small, unknown
field  of  a  sad  and grey industrial town like thousand of others.  Twenty-two
boys,  a  man  who  we  conventionally  call  referee, a man who is a common man
together  with  common  boys, that during the week works like almost every human
being  on  this  poor  planet  we  call Earth, a couple of friends and relatives
screaming  loudly  don't  make  a  better  world,  don't  help  the cause of the
salvation  of  the  rain-forests  and don't solve any problem of our loved-hated
planet.   I'm  sure  of  it.  Nevertheless comrades, believe me, the pleasure of
playing  soccer, wherever and whenever you want is worth to do it, also if it is
not so useful.
