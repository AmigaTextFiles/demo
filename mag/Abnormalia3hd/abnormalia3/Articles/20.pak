                        3INTRODUCTION TO THE MAGIC GUILD 

                      2by Zulkir Maligor of The Magic Guild


In the funny and juvenile playground named "Amiga scene" there is also space for
persons  who see the whole thing as a good occasion to have fun and to play some
fantasy characters.
TMG  can't  be  considered  a  conventional demo group just for the fact that it
seldom  releases  demos  or  intros,  its  releases  anyway  are  various and of
different nature.
Someone  can  consider  them even lame but just because he hasn't understood the
spirit behind the group.

Leader  and  founder  of  the  Guild  is  Merlyn,  mysterious  half elf from the
Norwegian lands whose age is still an unnamable secret.
One of the distinctive points of the group is indeed the age.
Among  the numerous members, coming from a dozen of countries, you can find some
quite old dudes, for the standard scene age.
The  medium age of the group must be one of the highest ever and relatively high
is also the number of female members.

The  magicians  of  The Magic Guild are all characters of the stories written by
Merlyn and others that have filled various mags for some months.
One  of  the  most original and entertaining particularity of The Magic Guild is
right  this  fact.   You  can be the character of short stories written by other
members and you can write a short story about you and your mates.
All  the  members  have  at  their  entrance  in the group an introduction story
written by Merlyn.
This  fact, added to the overall friendly atmosphere makes the Guild a very nice
and relaxing group to stay in.

As  member  of  the Guild and main editor of this magazine, I've thought that it
could  be useful to explain something about the Magic Guild stories that you can
read  in  Abnormalia and in other mags.  You can easily notice how brilliant and
skilled is Merlyn's way of writing and if you find some of his stories difficult
to  understand,  for  your  ignorance  about  the contest they are built in (the
fantasy  world  of  the Guild is called The M'Yiomosa Land) or for the fact that
they  are  actually  episodes  of  a  wider  story  (which Merlyn hopefully will
complete  some  day  in the next millennium), just contact Merlyn himself, or me
(Zulkir  Maligor/The  Magic  Guild  or  Macno/Abnormalia, two names for the same
person)  or  any  other  TMG  member of which you find the address for receiving
infos  about the group adventures and the complete collection of Merlyn's lovely
fantasy short stories.

Merlyn's address is:
Morten Ørn
Huldrevn. 51
