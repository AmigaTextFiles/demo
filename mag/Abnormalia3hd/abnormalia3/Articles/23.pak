"Conferatum  Spatioza!   Asharia  del  Furut!   Loberium fen Cariza!  Fett, gris
cabang!"
A  brief flash of blinding light, billowing, blue smoke and the sound of rolling
thunder.
Then utter silence.

The arid smoke rolled around the vast chamber.
A  low  cough  and  the  nerve-racking  scraping of wood against stone broke the
silence.
"Oink?"
The tiny sound filtered through the smoke-cloud.

"Oink?   Cor  blimey!   Open  the shutters and get rid of this infernal smoke!",
rasped an irritated voice.

The  sounds  of scurrying feet and the high-pitched squeek of iron-hinges echoed
through the chamber.

Windy drafts soon dispelled the smoke.

The  black-robed,  sternlooking  wizard  seated in the ornate, high-backed chair
rose  halfway  to  his feet, staring incredously at the small figure standing in
front of the ebony-black table.

"Oink?"

A  small,  rotund,  pink  piglet looked forlornly back at the blackrobed wizard.
"So, Loberium fen Cariza, eh?  Loberia, damn it!  LOBERIA!!"
The  bushy-browed  wizard swallowed his anger and looked pityingly at the former
apprentice.
Whenever  would  the  young  upstarts  learn  to  consider and respect the risks
involved in arcane spell-casting?
"Take it away!"
Waving  a  dismissive hand at the piglet, the blackrobed wizard sank back in his
tall chair.

"Having trouble with our candidates, are we?"
A mild, slightly scrathy voice sounded from the door-way.
Turning  an  appreciative  look at the latest addition to the Academy of Magic's
amount of livestock, the redrobed wizard smiled.
"Merlyn,  you  old  rogue!",  exclaimed  the High Judge of Magic, jumping to his
feet.
"Welcome to my humble abode!"
A broad grin split the coal-black beard of the blackrobed wizard.
"How  are  matters  -  apart  from your contributions to the local meat-market?"
Smiling the old half-elf walked towards his friend and embrassed him warmly.


The  Academy  of  Magic,  situated  in the Township of Lillies, is the uppermost
school  of  magic  in  the  entire M'Yiomoza Lands.  A highly prestigious place,
where only the most talented apprentices in the magical arts, were admitted.
Due  to the gruelling tests, of which the final test; The Quest Magica, presided
over  by  the  High  Judge  of  Magic  himself,  was  the toughest, the hopefull
apprentices  needed  supreme  talents as well as nerves of steel.  Any failures,
however  small,  at  the  Quest  Magica  held the direst consequences as for the
luckless ones!


The  High  Judge  of Magic, called The Referee, was naturally a select member of
the fabled team of magicians, sorcerors, druids and magic users, who constituted
The Magic Guild.
A  relatively  recent  member  of this exalted ranks of wizards, The Referee had
none the less become a close friend of Merlyn, the founder of The Magic Guild.


"You must be weary after your long journey", deducted The Referee," come, friend
and partake a goblet of wine in my chambers."
Shuffling after his reverended host, Merlyn peered at the artefacts displayed on
the  numerous  shelves  lining  the  corridor.   Several new ones since his last
visit.  Some even of an unknown quality!
Stopping  to inspect more closely an intriguing, mouldy object, the old half-elf
completely forgot his host, walking down the dimly lit hallway.
"Obviously  a  fairly  new  arrival,  this one", thought Merlyn," as these other
objects on display are at least cleaned of excess dirt."
Carefully brushing cobwebs and accumulated strange substances from the artefact,
Merlyn examined the revealed little box with a zealot's intensity.
Slowly lifting the box' lid, the wizard peered inside.
An unnatural darkness hid the box' possible contents.
Stroking   his   long  beard  thoughtfully,  the  mage  considered  the  various
possibilities.
A  variation  of  "Deep Pockets"?  A mere "dark spell"?  Black, matte paint?  Or
was the bloody box simply empty?!
Consequences be damned! Grabbing the box, Merlyn shook it experimentally.
Something shifted inside!
A  nagging  thought  of  hidden  traps didn't stop the travelworn, now irritated
wizard from further explorations.
Bowing his head, Merlyn stuck his nose into the box and sniffed.
A  tiny  blue-grey  puff  of  smokelike  substance  suddenly  shot from the box'
interior and straight up Merlyn's nostrils!  A poison-gas trap!

Sneezing  violently the old wizard inadvertedly dropped the box and clutched his
nose.   A  series of violent sneezes and muted bellows brought servants hurrying
from several parts of the Academy.
The  Referee  was among the first on the scene.  Regarding his friend bemusedly,
he waved the servants away.
Casting  a  windspell  the  Referee effectively cleared dubious fumes and litter
from the hallway.
Shakingly  straightening, Merlyn rubbed his nose vigourously.  Rummaging through
his numerous pockets, he finally drew forth a tiny, blue vial.
Unstopping it, he took a small sip of the antidote and belched contently.
"My nose'll be the death of me one day", the old mage prophesied.
Regarding  the  red-rubbed, slightly swollen beak of a nose, the Referee grinned
impishly.
"It  rather  depends  on  where you stick it, doesn't it?", the High Judge asked
innocently.
Appearing  not  to  hear the remark, Merlyn squatted down on the stone floor and
carefully rummaged through the remains of the mysterious artefact.
Among  the  splinters  and  larger  pieces  of broken wood, an intriguing, small
parcel lay wrapped in ebony-black velvet.
Pulling  his  wand  from  its  protective  scabbard, Merlyn carefully pushed and
flipped the parcel around, eyeing it intently.
No further traps or mishaps revealed themselves.
Regarding  his  friend's antics, the Referee conjured up a deep armchair and sat
contently down, obviously intent on enjoying whatever followed next.

On  Merlyn's request, the Referee pulled a short dagger from his belt and tossed
it to his friend.
Armed  with  means  both  magical and menial, the half-elf fell to his task once
more, feverously attacking the parcel's wrappings.
Cutting  the thin, tough cord, he slowly inserted the dagger's point into a fold
and flipped back the black cloth.
Repeating  the process several times, the parcel's contents suddenly lay exposed
before Merlyn's astonished stare.
Sensing  the sudden tension in his friend's frozen attitude, the Referee rose to
his feet and walked over to stand by Merlyn's side.
A golden letter lay blinking and pulsating on the black velvet wrappings.

"How did you come by this?", asked Merlyn in a shaken whisper.
"As  near  as  I  can recollect, it was brought here together with various other
artefacts, by a wandering cleric", answered the Judge.
"Obviously  no-one's  had  the  time to examine it yet", he continued," it looks
unfamiliar to me, but you seem to recognize it?"
Nodding  mutely  Merlyn  picked  up  the  letter and turning it over reverently,
studied it intently.
"It's  a  rather  long  story,  so I suggest we withdraw to your chambers, if we
may?", Merlyn said, raising to his feet once more.
Nodding the Referee preceeded the half-elf down the hallway.

"Are you familiar with the stories dealing with the Elven Nations and the Dragon
Curse?",  asked  Merlyn  from  the  depth of a particularly large, soft-pillowed
armchair in the Referee's study.
"I've heard bits and rumours, that's all", answered the High Judge," but nothing
substantial."

The evening was well advanced before Merlyn had finished his tale.
The origins of the war-like conflicts between the Elves and dragons were forever
lost in the mists of Time.
In  recent years the dragons had unexplainably risen to hitherto unknown heights
of ferocity and strength.
Thus  the  name  "The  Dragon  Curse"  lately had taken on an even more sinister
meaning and depth.

Wizards,  clerics, druids and adventurers had for years sought means and ways to
help  the  beleaguered Elves.  Steel and magic were, although mighty weapons, no
real match against the flying beasts.

A  few  years  back the band of wizards and mages, known as The Magic Guild, had
come  across  magical  artefacts, in the forms of letters, which may prove to be
the key to the riddle of the Dragon Curse.

Sofar the wizards of The Magic Guild had found four letters.
The  Magic  Guild's  mysterious  guru; Jogan, had searched for clues in his vast
library of scrolls and spell-books.  He was convinced that arranged in the right
order  the  letters  would  form  a  magic word, possibly a formulae to lift the
dragon Curse!
But four letters were obviously too few in numbers.  There had to be more of the
magical artefacts hidden somewhere in the M'Yiomoza Lands.

"As  you  probably  know several of our fellow-Guilders are presently on quests,
hopefully involving the retrieval of more of these letters", concluded Merlyn.

Nodding the Referee pointed at the letter still laying snugly in Merlyn's hand.

"So presumably that is one of the missing letters?", he asked.
"Judging  from  it's form and tingling feel, I'd say definitely aye!", consented
Merlyn, looking down at the letter "A".

As  Merlyn  were  about  to  leave  the Academy of Magic a week later, he turned
towards his host.
"Would  you  like to come back to the Crystal Cave with me?", asked Merlyn, "I'm
awaiting the return of some of the Guilders.  Hopefully their quests have proven
successfull, so we may get closer to solving the Dragon Curse riddle."

Shaking his head, the High Judge of Magic declined Merlyn's offer.
"I'm  hoping  to  attend The Third Gathering", he said," but till then my duties
here at the Academy are too numerous to let me leave for yet a while."
Shrugging  his  shoulders,  Merlyn  gripped  his  friend's  hand  in the ancient
handshake of Wizards and bade him farewell.
"See you then, compadre", he said.

Standing  on  the  battlements  of  the  Academy, the Referee looked down at the
retreating  figure  of  the  leader  of The Magic Guild disappearing through the
city's southern portal.

Softly he imagined he heard a whisper on the winds;

         "Back to the shadows and solitude of the Arcane Arts."
