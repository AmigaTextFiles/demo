2                            By Rocketeer of Ram Jam


Just  some  years ago, there was a photo going around in Europe.  It represented
an  alien  in his suit.  Many people stated that he was one of the passengers of
the  alien  aircraft  that  had crashed near Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, and of
which the government had always denied the existence.  Some months later, it was
discovered  that  the  photo  had  been made by a Canadian, Christian Page, to a
puppet.   His  aim  was  to show everybody how simple it is to cheat people when
they  really want to believe in something.  Thanks to the Freedom of Information
Act,  the  opening  of  the  American  archives also helped to solve the Roswell
'mystery':   it  wasn't  an alien aircraft the flying object that crashed near a
ranch,  it  was an experimental rocket.  And the supposed aliens were just three
monkeys, who lost their life for experimental purposes.  Of course there will be
people who'll say that this is just shit, that the US government is making fools
of  us, and that we must fight for the truth.  But, why shall we believe in what
they  say?   And  why  shall  we  believe  in  what Mr.Cooper said, if he hasn't
produced  any evidence to prove his statements?  Yes, he has referred himself to
some really existed or existing organizations, he has got very good credentials,
but  this  is  not  enough.   Moreover,  there  are  also  some strange or wrong
statements  in  his  speech,  for example, he says that when he saw one of those
flying  objects for the first time, he reported that to the officer of the deck,
who  then  followed  him  together  with  the  captain and the quartermaster who
brought  a 35MM CAMERA.  Why this guy didn't make any photos of the object?  Was
he  too  shocked?   Mr.Cooper  didn't  say.   Maybe  he forgot to.  Anyway there
shouldn't  be  any photo of the supposed aircraft, otherwise he would have them.
About  the  Kennedy assassination:  Mr.Cooper says that it was William Greer who
shot  the president, his driver.  Well, the driver was sitting in the front left
of  the car, while the president was on the rear right.  The special bullet that
should  have  been fired by the supposed assassin was the last one, the one that
took  part  of the president's head away.  If someone of you have seen the movie
JFK  by  Oliver  Stone,  there  is  a  part  in which they show this scene:  the
president  has  already  been hit, but he's not dead, and he has his head leaned
forward when suddenly a bullet hits it in the right back, taking off a part, and
you  can  clearly  see that the president's head moves backward and to the LEFT.
So  it's impossible that the shot came from his left.  Besides all, this 'story'
is  really  unbelieveable,  especially  in  those  parts  about drugs import and
assassinations  involving the US government.  I really hope that they will never
turn  out  to  be right:  it would be terrible to find that millions of men have
been  fooled by the same people they had put trust in, and I don't want to think
about  what  could  happen  if a situation of this kind would occur.  The aliens
exist and they are keeping an eye on us...  it could be a good plot for a movie,
and  in  fact  there is a not very known director, who is very interested in the
UFOs,  and  whose  name is Mario Gariazzo, that is going to direct a movie about
this.   The  title  should  be  something  like this:  'The Silence Conspiracy'.
Sooner or later in a cinema near you.
