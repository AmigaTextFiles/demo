Doctor  Vascotto is happy.  Finally he has his invention built.  After years and
years  of  hard work his 'Dusting Machine' is ready to be tested.  It can reduce
everything (also human being!) to the size of a speck of dust, and then bring it
back to its primitive size.  Amazing!
The  machine  is  looking like a big phone box, but, instead of the phone itself
there  is  a bunch of strange cables connected with strange leds'n'lights and at
the  basis  a  big  iron  chair  surrounded  by tons of sticks and buttons.  Dr.
Vascotto  is very proud of his invention.  He had the brilliant idea of the 'MS'
(it's  not  the  label  of  Italian  cigarettes  but the acronyms of Molecular
Shower!)  that is the 'heart' of his machine, some years ago.  He was painting a
wall  of  his  laboratory  when he put a foot in a wrong way and he fell off the
ladder,  he  hit  the  ground  with  the  head  and then he had the vision:  the
'Molecular  Shower'.   He  drew it and then, as I said before, after years and
years he built it.
The  doc  is  now really excited.  He calls Valdimir, his assistant, to test the
machine.   Valdimir's not what we call 'an excited man'.  He likes the professor
as  he  has been like a father for him, but he also knows he's a little bit mad,
sometimes,  if  always can be defined sometimes.  But he perfectly knows that if
he  will  not  test  the doc's machine he will have to find another job, and, in
these times of economic crisis, is not very easy.
So  Vladimir  enters  the box and sits on the chair.  Doc Vascotto turns on some
gadgets  and  pull some levels.  Leds start to be enlightened and strange noises
start to come out from a hole.  Vladimir starts to pray, while the doctor begins
the countdown.  Two-One-Ready-Set-Go.  A flash of light.  A lightning.  And Vlad
has disappeared.  Doc Vascotto turns on the monitor, but he confuses the monitor
with  the  television so he's a little bit angry when he watches, instead of the
molecular  percentage in his machine and the cartesian position of his Vladimir,
a  soccer-match.   He  decides to turn off the stupid television the very moment
Juventus (it's in fact Juventus against Milan!) scores with Baggio.
However  now  monitor's  on  and  he's able to look at Vlad in the middle of the
Atomic  Dish,  that is that kind of chair I described before, small like a speck
of  dust.   Experiment  performed rightly!!!  Eureka!!  Doctor Vascotto is happy
like  a  chicken,  if a chicken can be happy.  He's so happy he put another time
the  foot in a wrong position and he stumbles directly on the machine.  He opens
the door of the machine with an arm and a squall of wind brings away Vladimir.
Vladimir  flies,  flies together with all the dust of the doc's laboratory, then
together  with  the  dust  of  the whole town, before to drop down on shelf in a
boy's  room,  while  the mother is cleaning it.  He's thrown away by a broom and
then  put  under  a carpet.  Valdimir's not very happy about his position.  He's
thinking  that he could remain there for the rest of his life and these were not
his projects.  But suddenly he's removed from that position by a vacuum- cleaner
used  by  the  maid.   Then,  after he's put in the rubbish with the dust of the
whole  house  he's  carried  to  the trash-deposit of this town.  But during the
voyage  another  squall of wind brings him away.  Flying and flying he drop down
just  on  an  ice-cream  a young boy is lapping.  Poor Vlad's taken by the boy's
tongue  and  he's  thrown directly to the stomach.  Rumors are saying he's still
there, together with a lot of dust!
