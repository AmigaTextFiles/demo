You  are  listening  some  music  on your bed, leaving the mind to voyage in its
endless trips on the musical waves, letting the notes flow in your brain.
The  hour is late and the music is quite soporific, it jokes with your fantasies
melting down logic with animal instincts.
Your  eyes  are  closed  and  opened  and closed and opened until you don't know
anymore  if they are seeing something or not, what they look is not perceived by
your  mind,  the  opened  eyelips just let the light to enter in an empty skull,
where any sing of rational thought is lost.
Suddenly  you  feel  something strange, you don't manage to grab and fix what is
this  abnormal  particular  till  you stare the clock in front of your bed:  its
pointers  are  running  in  the  wrong  direction.  They are going back in time,
ticking  seconds  to  the  wrong side, fooling centuries of history and science.
The insane clock wakes your mind, gives sight to your eyes.
A  zany  mechanical trouble, you think, and you turn again your attention to the
music,  trying  to  ignore  the  fact.  Few seconds pass, you cast a look at the
mirror  on  the  wall  and  you  see  something that worries you, you are seeing
yourself  as you were ten years ago.  A kid, more or less, with the clothes of a
kid  and  the  look  of a kid.  It is so inexplicable, you don't notice anything
else  particular happening.  You look again the clock, it is going always in the
wrong  direction, you look the mirror and you saw an infant.  You seem in normal
conditions,  your  hands, your clothes, your body is the same have always owned,
there  is  only the cheating mirror showing an image of your past and the clock,
reminding you that you're going to the past.
You  don't  feel  at  your  ease,  you wonder if you are dreaming, if someone is
somehow  joking with you, you glance again the clock and strangely surprised you
see its pointers still.  The reverse movement is stopped, you wonder if time has
stopped to go in the wrong direction.
It's  cold  now,  very cold.  You stand up but your movements are slow, there is
something  strange in the air, it's like liquid, more dense, it grasps your legs
and your skin.
You breath, with an impressive fatigue.  It has become hard to breath.
You  look  again  at  the mirror and this time the mirror doesn't show anything,
anything  at  all,  it  reflects  the  furnitures  in front of it but it doesn't
reflect your body.
You feel like a fly drowning in the spit of an evil kid.
From  the ceiling a huge tongue licks your head and disgusted it moans "Too less
salt".  It slimes away and it leaves in the bedroom a terrible smell of spit and
decomposed organic matter.
On  the ground you see the cadaver of a dog.  It doesn't remain much of it, it's
completely dismayed, a long cut opens its head.  Among the grey brain matter you
notice something moving.  Worms or maybe just words or even totally new worlds.
You  stare  the  brain  better  and the mirror fills your mind, it shows a lunar
landscape.
You wonder if you are an ectoplasm or a vampire or a joke of a mad cartoon.  You
decide  that  it's  better  to  drink something, to refresh the brain, to breath
again.
A  huge  can  of  coke walks into your bedroom.  It says "Drink me or die".  You
drink to survive but the coke is wine and the wine is the blood of Christ.
You clean your mouth with your right hand, the blood is already coagulated.
You  try  to  open  your mouth but you can't.  A mask of solid blood covers your
teeth.
Your feet follow you to the kitchen, you take a bottle of water from the fridge,
you  drink  it  all, without pauses, almost like a liberation.  You don't notice
that  some  water seems to turn into a black liquor just before entering in your
mouth.   You  look  down  again.  In the place of the dead dog there is now your
body.
It  smells,  insects are running out from the mouth, an eye is out of its orbit,
it  looks  you  disgusted.   The head of your corpse has a long cut, deep to the
bone.
Where you hoped to see your brain there is blood.  Brown coagulated blood.
You  realize   that  the blood of the Cross has eaten up your brain, your sight,
your words.  It's the Revelation.
You  touch  yourself,  you wonder how you can see your body on the ground if you
are standing up.
You understand:  you are the mirror.
A  deep  breath of relief fills your silicon lungs.  You seem to see things in a
more  detached  way,  life  has  a brand new color now.  Your body on the ground
closes his eyes, your mirror ego standing up walks to the wall, to join the real
mirror.   You  fly back to your bed, where the music starts to come back on your
ears.  It's all accomplished now.
Before waking up for real you finally understand that you were dreaming.
"Nice dream", you say with a strange feeble voice.

Thanks. See you next night.
