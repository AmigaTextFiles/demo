All  the  newspapers  of the country had at least a full page dealing about that
fact.
Two  amateur  fishers found under the water of Bracciano's lake two big boxes of
iron,  and on the borders of these boxes they found the fascist's seal:  a big M
surrounded by horses and Roman warriors.
All  the  intellectuals around the whole Europe had been alerted and invited to
come to visit Italy just to have a look at the two cases that, as stated by some
Italian  historical  critics,  could  held  some  important  documents  about an
agreement between Churchill and Mussolini.
The  Italian  neo-fascist party was rather excited about these news.  The people
behind  it  were  hoping  to  find something it could rehabilitate the figure of
their  dictator.  They started to spread rumors that some documents in the cases
could  test  that Mussolini was forced by Churchill, who had thought Italy could
limit  the  German  power,  to  find an agreement with Hitler; that, in reality,
Mussolini  had  no  intentions to enter the war, as stated in all the historical
book written since the 8th of September 1943.
However the operations to recover the two cases started some days after the news
from the fishers.
It  took  about  a  couple of hours to bring the boxes up from the water, but it
took  much  more  time  to  have all the authorizations from the vary ministers.
'Nautilus',  a  firm  with  a great knowledge about these matters was charged to
lead  the  whole 'mission' by a commission of intellectuals and technicians, and
after,  as  I  already  said  before,  two  hours the two cases were placed in a
security  hall  in  a  secret  museum  of  Rome,  under  the  eyes  of  fourteen
Carabinieri.
The  day  after,  in  the main hall of the Historical Museum of the Second World
War,  while  there  were present all the Italian politicians, the televisions of
the  whole world like Rai, Cnn, Bbc, Bsc, and a plethora of journalists from the
most  famous  newspapers  worldwide  such  as  'The Time', 'the Washington Post,
'L'Osservatore  Romano',  'Il  Secolo XIX' and 'Abnormalia' two technicians were
charged to break the seals and to open the cases.
Suddenly a silence of fear and emotion overwhelmed the people.
There  were  no  whispers at all.  The only rumor you could hear was the monkey-
wrench of the two guys working.  It lasted two eternal minutes.
After broken the seals they opened the cases. All the flashes flashed. 
But they find a wooden box.
Again  the technicians started to work.  Another couple of minutes and again all
the  flashes flashed...  But what they flashed for?  They flashed to enlighten a
big box of old, smelling, gray DUST.
All  the  people  who were not involved directly in the fact started to laugh as
they  saw  for  what  it  had  been  spent  a  plenty  of  money,  while all the
intellectuals were trying to stop the television troupes to film them.
Politicians  showed  their  surprise  in  different ways.  The Right was sad but
started  to  shout about a tampering of the two boxes by the chief of the museum
and  was  screaming  for vengeance, the Left was chatting with journalists about
the  fact they are always right (not politically, however), the history was safe
another  time  and that the values of the Resistance Movement were always actual
and bla bla.
But  louder  than  everyone  were  laughing Francesco Petrini, Salvo Varuzzi and
Paolo Bruni.  After Modigliani the whole Italy was cheated again.
