For  ages,  Sceners  from all over the world have expressed their wish for some
kind  of  Scene  Oscar.   An  annual  award  for the best releases and the best
producers  as  reward and as chance to raise motivation.  In uncounted articles
writers  have tried to figure out how the dream could become reality, but never
found an answer.

Generation did.

                       Therefore we proudly announce the

                            Generation Awards (tm)
                             (annually since 1997)

By  revising  as  much  as  releases  from  the last year, the Generation Award
Commitee  has chosen the leading handful of productions which set standards for
1997.   These are the nominees which we have found and from which you may chose
the Generation Award winners.

Please  read  through  the  list  of nominees carefully and then sign sign your
favourite   with  an  "X".   Please  mail  the  filled  sheet  to  brau@dov.net
(RokDaZone).  Due organisation reasons we need your answer as soon as possible,
so please reply immediately.

---> DEADLINE IS THE 31st OF JANUARY 1998!!!
