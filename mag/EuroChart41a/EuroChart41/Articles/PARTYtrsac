TRSAC'00.5 will take place on 
"Bankagerskolen" in Horsens, Denmark 
the 3rd-5th November 2000.

Transport
------------

By train/bus:
Take the train to Horsens. From the 
train/bus-station in Horsens take bus 
no. 5 towards "Bankager" and ask the 
driver to stop at "Bankagerskolen" 
(right after the roundabout and 
"Føtex").

By car:
Take highway E45 to Horsens. Get off 
the highway towards "Horsens S" 
(offramp no. 57) and turn towards 
Horsens (just check the sign). Go
straight through all roundabouts until 
you reach a trafficlight. Turn left.

At the second trafficlight turn right 
and take the first road to the left. 
This is "Bankagervej". Follow the 
road. Just after the roundabout you'll 
see "Føtex". Now you should check for 
TRSAC signs leading you the rest of 
the way. They're on the right hand 
side just after "Føtex".

A roadmap is availiable at 
www.cromatics.dk/trsac/

if this seems unreasonable, do not 
hesitate to contact us a

The entrance fee is 50dkr for danes. 
Foreigners except matt/ozone get in
for free ;o)

Excessive drinking combined with 
loud, noisy and disturbing behaviour
will not be tolerated.

If such behaviour takes place you 
will be subject to one or more of the
following treatments:

1. Nic0 will sell ya one if his 
   special "choker-wieners".
2. Farfar beats ya with a 
   cotton-stick!
3. You have to mud-wrestle Darkhawk!
4. We will leave you outside, naked 
   and unarmed, alone with the violent
   youth in Denmark!

   broken/stolen equipment at TRSAC

4. If any matters arise at all we will 
   only meet your demand if threatened

-*All rules in the competetions are 
  subject to change!*-

keep yourself updated at 
              www.cromatics.dk/trsac

Amiga Demo
----------

The size of the demo must not exceed 
8mb unpacked. It must be able to run 
on a 030/Fpu with 16mb ram, but it 
will be shown on an A4060 PPC with 
ALOT of mem ;o) CyberGFX is optional, 
but AGA MUST be supported!


PC Demo
-------

The size of the demo must not exceed 
8mb unpacked. If you're smart, you 
make the demo work in win98 or win2k 
as we're not sure the bigscreen loves 
DOS as much as you do ;o) We do not 
accept demos running on LINUX or more 
obscure OS'es. The compo machine will 
be atleast a p3 550mhz with 128mb RAM 
and a RivaTNT2 gfx card, that you may 
NOT take advantage of! Haha! ;o)

Amiga Intro
-----------

Same rules as for the Amiga Demo, but 
the size of the intro must not exceed 
40kb (40960 bytes).

4-channel Module
----------------

Max uncompressed size is 1mb. Max 
playlength 7min. Format accepted: 
standard Protracker MOD format. If we 
receive more than 15 entries, we 
might gather a jury and let them pick 
15 entries to compete.

Multi-channel Module
--------------------

Max uncompressed size is 2mb. Max 
playlength 7min. Formats accepted: 
MOD, XM, DBM, MED, IT, S3M - no 
compression allowed! If we receive 
more than 15 entries, we might gather 
a jury and let them pick 15 entries to 
compete.

PC Intro
-------

Same rules as for the PC Demo, but the 
size of the intro must not exceed 64kb 
(65536 bytes). If the init code for 
windows makes the intro too large 
we'll show it anyway if only you can 
provide us with a DOS-executeable that 
lies within the limits (and has the 
same content).

Pixel Gfx
---------

Max resolution of the picture is 
1024x768 24bit. It must be delivered 
in either iff, jpg, tga, png, gif, bmp 
or tiff format. Together with your 
picture you have to deliver 3-4 
sketches of the work in progress!

Raytraced Gfx
-------------

Max resolution of the picture is 
1024x768 24bit. It must be delivered 
in either iff, jpg, tga, png, gif, 
bmp or tiff format.

Wild Demo
---------

You know this one! Deliver your 
contribution to us as avi, mpg or 
quicktime. Or bring your own computer 
and let us hook it up to the 
bigscreen. We reserve the right to 
disqualify any wilddemo if the content 
isn't computer-related enough.

Amiga/PC 4k Intro
-----------------

Max size is 4096bytes (the same rules 
about windows executeables as with the 
PC 64k intro apply). Other than that, 
the rules are the same as in the 
demo-compos.

...and some surprise-compos with 
   surprizes!

Prizes
------

Since this is not a commercial 95% 
gamers party, we have NO money prizes!
But we have our bronze, silver and 
gold exclusive the real scene after 
christmas trophies, which has already 
caused a severe climb on the social 
ladder for many of the winners of the
last party!
