»CL8:Introduction
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL0:After the positive feedback concerning
my original article, Writers on
Writers (released in Showtime 14), I
decided to complete this belated
follow-up: Writers on Magazines. 

In the same vein as its predecessor,
this article takes the views of those
associated with the subject matter
(i.e. diskmags) with the intention of
giving a somewhat more educated
response.
       »PIC:Darklight.+EC_07.iff»









Regretfully, since this article was
conceived there has been a major
decline in the amount of disk
magazines released on the Amiga scene.
Nonetheless, I have decided to
complete this article in the hope that
it may inspire those who once played a
role in this essential aspect of scene
life.

»CL4:SEENPOINT by Scoopex
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Wade writes:»CL0: It resides at number 1 in
most charts, and deservingly so. In
terms of appearance, I believe it took
a step backwards over the years. It's
murky colour and smeared panels are
far from appealing. However, what it
misses in design, it makes up for with
its quality content. Hard hitting
facts, scoops and even libel; highly
proficient language skills and tough
quality control, Seenpoint has the lot
and flaunts it better than any other
mag existing today.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL3:Sane writes:»CL2: Even though I am a member
of the staff of this mag, I want to
say one thing: Seenpoint has by far
the best and most skilled staff.
»CL1:Bytebreaker writes:»CL0:
Pleasant for eye and ear.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL5:Shade writes:»CL4: Has become better with
time. With Sane and Fishwave comes
intrigue, interest and lies, something
that naturally attracts the attention
of the readers. A lot of bad things'
been said about the way journalism is
conducted in this magazine, but that
does not mean it's not interesting. By
loading Seenpoint you will always find
something you want to read. If it's
true or not, that's another story :)
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL8:Curt Cool writes:
»CL7:The best mag these days. Provocative,
interesting and not released too
often. Always caters for quality
articles by the three main editors.
»CL4:TRASHCAN by Network
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Wade writes:
»CL0:Fantastic design and graphics, with
that oldschool atmosphere. The article
content varies so much, from excellent
to extremely poor. It would make
faster progress if cut down, to a pack
mag for example, dedicated to its most
prominent articles.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL3:Sane writes:
»CL2:A bit unprofessional but VERY
entertaining nevertheless. Since The
Ripper joined I am sure it will become
better and better...if it stays alive.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL5:Shade writes: 
»CL4:Good magazine with the ROM feeling.
Won't stay for long though...
»CL8:Ghandy writes:
»CL7:The design is very much compareable to
the old ROM design but I don`t care
about that. Trashcan wasn`t very good
but became better and better every
single issue that came out! 
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Bytebreaker writes:
»CL0:Quite attractive, especially the
WB-Icon. No complaints concerning the
user interface. 
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL3:Curt Cool writes:
»CL2:Leunam is doing a great job with
Trashcan. ECS rules. A diskmag in the
classic style with articles in the
classic style, contrary to Seenpoint
and Insomnia.


»CL4:GENERATION by Artwork
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Wade writes:
»CL0:The panel graphics are quite
extraordinary and the cliparts are
sufficient, but the small font and
plain backdrop make it quite
unpleasant on the eyes. It's content
has had its ups and downs. Issues
leading up to 25b were outstanding,
pushing it to a well deserved spot in
the charts. 25b onwards, the magazine
became little more than a corporate
billboard containing way too much in
the way of outside support and
pre-released material in the form of
party reports, results, news group
information and commercial banter. Its
death was a little overdue.

»CL3:Sane writes:
»CL2:Although it featured MANY
non-interesting articles it was for me
the most professional magazine in the
entire history of the Scene. Rokdee as
mained, what can go wrong?
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL5:Ghandy writes:
»CL4:A good mag for sure! Is there any
chance that Rokdazone will continue
after he`s now so busy with 1000 other
things? (Tiefsee Music Productions,
University, Job as Webdesigner etc.) I
really hope it!
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:Bytebreaker writes:
»CL6:The GUI hasn't changed much throughout
the years. Nevertheless it is easy to
handle and that's the main point.

»CL4:GENERATION by Artwork (continued)
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Shade writes:
»CL0:Never really been my favourite, but
of course a very good magazine.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL3:Curt Cool writes:
»CL2:Another classic mag. Will it ever be
released again? Haven't seen much of
RokDaZone lately?!?

»CL4:THE SCENE PRESS by Nerve Axis
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Wade writes:
»CL0:Nice debut and a vast improvement over
Pressure. Not only do Nerve Axis own
the most advanced diskmag engine to
date, but this time used it to display
interesting articles, if a few too
many non scene related. We now wait
for Issue 2... and wait...
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL3:Sane writes:
»CL2:No comment. Ok, one comment: Shite.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Curt Cool writes:
»CL0:The new Scenetime? The Pressure code
is fantastic, the articles are the
usual stuff, and it should be released
quite often.

»CL5:Ghandy writes:
»CL4:Pressure & TSP are very much
compareable so I write only one
comment about both. What both provide
is a very, very good design, fantastic
titlepics a perfect code and great
musics. For me Pressure was simply a
waste of energy as nearly NONE of the
articles inside found my interest. TSP
was a bit better but there`s still a
lot to do to find the hotter topics
for the readers. I`m not sure if the
Nerve Axis guys will continue with TSP
after the Kaosmaster-affair... we`ll
see!

»CL4:SCENETIME/SHOWTIME by Darkage
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Wade writes:»CL0: Amiga Inc etc don't need
to waste their money on advertising
when they have franchise mags like
this; overflowing with game adverts,
fat cat speeches and commercial
conference reports, in cahoots with
naive optimism. However, I'd be lying
if I said I disliked the magazine. The
charts and gallery sections manage to
compensate for the lacking features
and its regularity motivated the
entire scene. In terms of design, it
remained very traditional, yet was
always a pleasant environment in which
to read.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL3:Shade writes:»CL2:  You browse through the
charts, what else?
   »PIC:Budgie-euro3.iff»








»CL5:Sane writes:
»CL4:Very, very, very unprofessional and
lame (but oh so entertaining and
inspiring!) articles.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL8:Curt Cool writes:
»CL7:Will it survive? The code sucks,
otherwise the same criticism as TSP
applies.


»CL4:ROM by Essence
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Wade writes:

»CL0:Undoubtedly one of the greatest
magazines of the scene. Its interface
is still outstanding compared to
today's standards; a non aga magazine
that scrolls, multitasks and displays
colourful cliparts; a feat that no one
has been able to match since, despite
AGA and fastmem assistance. Aside from
its fantastic design and code, Rom was
the father of professional scene
writing, taking inspiration from real
life media and journalism. Rom set a
standard for other magazines to aspire
to. 


»CL3:Sane writes:
»CL2:Best design until now! Great music and
gfx that really dominated; a joy for
your ears and eyes. The articles were
too long and too boring though.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL5:Ghandy writes:
»CL4:Perfect design, still the best code of
the Scene (nobody will ever manage to
beat Touchstone!) , fantastic modules
& brilliant titlepics. But the
contents were always disapointing for
me. What`s in here for me to read, I
asked myself.. nothing really
embrassing to read. 
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:Bytebreaker writes:
»CL6:Rest in peace. You were not only
pretty, you were even functional.

»CL4:ROM by Essence (continued)
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Shade writes: 
»CL0:Greatness in the making, but just
became more and more boring as time
passed by...
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL3:Curt Cool writes:

»CL2:The old king of diskmags. The mag
which set some standards.





























»CL4:RETRO by Instinct
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Wade writes:»CL0: To repeat the words of
the entire scene, Retro's design is
terrible. This is somewhat due to
palette restrictions and lacking
features. However, the minimalistic
surroundings serve their purpose,
despite its Amos engine. In terms of
articles, it got off to a bad start
with its joke sections and outright
infantile nature. By issue 3 things
began to look up and by issue 4, Retro
was deservingly among the scene's
leading diskmags. 
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL3:Shade writes: »CL2: I hate the layout.
Makes me feel I am reading a txt file.
Contents are average...

»CL5:Sane writes:»CL4: Unprofessional but warm.
I loved the idea behind Retro and the
style of it's maineditor. Retro was
very out of date, low budget and old
fashioned ... and that's why I loved
it.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL7:Ghandy writes:»CL8: I love it! Soda is a
very talented man so I don`t care much
about the fucking graphcis & the worse
code.. it was issue for issue a fun to
read it!
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Bytebreaker writes:»CL0: Constructive
advice: Better graphics, better music,
better design, more user comfort.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL3:Curt Cool writes: »CL2:A bit too small and
newcomer-ish. Crappy AMOS code,
sometimes a few nice articles.
»CL4:OEPIR RISTI by Citron
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Wade writes:

»CL0:Sufficient graphics and functional
code. The highlight of this mag was
always the title picture. The article
content, while spattered with the
occasional scene scoop was, on the
whole, very dull and banal. Oepir
Risti was impaired by numerous
factors: minimal support, annual
releases and an overall lack of heart.
It's death is not something I mourn.






»CL3:Sane writes:

»CL2:The best lifestyle magazine ever. It's
not a Scenemagazine as there were too
less Scene-related articles in it. The
design was superb. It was my favourite
mag of -both- Scene life and real
life!! I hope Henrik manages to
release it once again.

»CL9:--------------------------------------

»CL5:Ghandy writes:

»CL4:One of my favourite maggy productions!
Even if it`s a long time ago since the
last issue.



»CL4:OEPIR RISTI by Citron (continued)
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Bytebreaker writes:

»CL0:It didn't hit my personal taste, but
from an "objective" point of view I
cannot find serious criticism
concerning look and useability.

»CL9:--------------------------------------

»CL5:Curt Cool writes:

»CL4:The mag which shows what happens when
people have been on the scene for a
long time and stop caring what people
think. The only right way to go if you
want to create art instead of public
appeal.

»CL3:Shade writes: 
»CL2:Lovely magazine with great design and
perfect English... Meant only foor
cooks though *grin*
»CL4:INSOMNIA by Looker House
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Wade writes:

»CL0:I have to give the magazine full
credit on its appearance. The graphics
are beautifully pixelled, with a very
unique and artistic style. The fonts
and layout are very reminiscent of
ROM, which is no bad thing; making it
readable and comfortable on the eye.
Article wise it contains everything
one can expect from a leading scene
mag, though its delays mean that their
subjects are somewhat outdated or
irrelevant at its time of release. 






»CL3:Sane writes:
»CL2:
I don't like the design. The articles
of the issues I have seen were average
and only Bytebreakers and Shade's work
were worth to be read.

»CL9:--------------------------------------

»CL5:Curt Cool writes:
»CL4:
The second best mag. Amazing diskmag
too.





»CL4:PHOENIX by Giants
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Ghandy writes:

»CL0:An okay production.. they should stop
to print any texts from the internet
or from the boards.. nobody wants to
read that. 
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL3:Curt Cool writes:

»CL2:The same criticism as Retro applies.
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL5:Bytebreaker writes:

»CL4:The first issue looked nice. They
could raise the useability a little
next time, the first impression was
quite okay.

»CL7:Wade writes:»CL8: The panel graphics are
very nice as is the whole design, yet
the code seems to be a falling point,
requiring fastmem and containing heaps
of bugs and glitches. Judging on its
content, Phoenix's appears to follow
in the footsteps of Grapevine and the
lesser known The Word; a public forum
for anyone who wishes to contribute,
scener or non scener. A nice idea in
theory, but Phoenix (as with other
mags of this type) is overrun with a
childish content such as jokes and
entertainment coverage; like written
conversations from the local pub. When
one can obtain researched information
from television, the internet, paper
magazines or their local library,
Phoenix appears surplus in the
diskmag community.
»CL4:PHOENIX by Giants (continued)
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Sane writes:

»CL0:Nice but not extremely good. Now it
needs fastmem and that -as said- sucks
deep!

»CL9:--------------------------------------

»CL3:Shade writes: 

»CL2:Below average, but a nice try anyway.
I believe Wiseguy writes for fun and
fun alone and couldn't care less about
what I said and did not say here...
























»CL4:JURASSIC PACK by Gods
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Wade writes:

»CL0:Its design worked well for its initial
issues, but as time passed, it grew
outdated. Sadly, it's attempts to
improve the code was a complete
disaster, demonstrating no visual
advantages for its extended memory
requirement. While the interface
remains unchanged, the magazine itself
has evolved - perhaps a little too
much for one man (Ghandy) to handle
alone, despite his laborious efforts.
The result of its size increase comes
in the form of excessive fillers and
largely outdated articles - sometimes
upto and over a year old. Jurassic
Pack could keep a scener entertained
for hours, with a varied content
covering aspects of the demo scene,
crack scene, the Amiga and even the
PC, but often fails to maintain the
pace of scene events. 



»CL9:--------------------------------------



»CL3:Sane writes:
»CL2:
This must be the first low budget
"magazine" which made it into the
charts and that's great! The "mag" is
entertaining but not skilled. The last
issue was rushed and therefore it
sucked.


»CL4:JURASSIC PACK by Gods (continued)
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL1:Bytebreaker writes:

»CL0:The user interface hasn't been
upgraded to AGA-standard since ages. I
haven't seen, whether they managed it
in issue 7. If not: Just do it. ;)
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL3:Shade writes: 
»CL2:A pack, not more or less...
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL5:Curt Cool writes:

»CL4:A really nice mag. I was really
impressed with Zerox' work in the
latest issue which proved a very
interesting read.
