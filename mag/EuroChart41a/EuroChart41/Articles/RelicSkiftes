»CL8:   »BIG: The Reliable Swappers Chart
»CL9:»SML:--------------------------------------

»CL4:           by Darkhawk/IRIS

»CL0:Yes! Hello and welcome to this very 
first installment of a new,
alternative chart in the EC, namely
the Reliable Swappers charts! Fanfare
and drumroll please! Or not..

»CL8:Anyway, before I tell you what this is
all about, you might think that we
already have enough swappercharts by
having the best swappers chart, right?
Hmm, honestly, what use is that chart?
It fluctuates wildly, and if you
contact one of the swappers listed
there, chances are good that you won't
get any reply at all, because that
swapper has already quit the scene or
dropped swapping atleast. Or maybe you
write to a delayer, who is very
unstable in replying to you, and so
on. No, the Best Swappers chart is
good enough for motivation, and shows
whom people think is the best swapper.
However, if you are a swapper in need
of more contacts, this is obviously
not enough, you need to know which
swappers you can count on to reply to
you, which swappers will always be
there, and who are not going to quit
swapping right away. In short, you
need something like a chart over
swappers you can contact and expect a
long swapping time with. Tadaa,
fanfare and drumrolls again. There you
have it. 

»CL0:I got this idea since I'm a swapper
myself, and I know the situation,
every swapper has his delay lists,
where a lot of other swappers are
mentioned. Most of these will never
mail back again, but others (like
myself on occasions, heh) are just
slow and will mail back again. We need
to give the swappers some way of
knowing who they can depend on and who
they can't. Therefore, for this first
time, I asked some of my contacts to 
tell me about whom they considered 
reliable swappers. They need not be 
fast answerers, but they must be 
reliable at all costs. So, the plan is 
to make a chart of the most 
recommended ones, write a few lines 
about them, maybe interview some of 
them if this idea gets support. For 
this time, I only asked those of my 
contacts I had time to ask, but for 
the next installments of this chart, I 
will need support from all of you 
swappers out there, to make this chart 
more believable (as it is now, my 
contacts and myself are the reliable 
swappers it seems, isn't that.. 
convenient? ;)), it needn't take much 
time for you, just send me an email 
(or better yet, a real letter, hehe), 
with the names of those of your 
contacts you consider most reliable. 
You can write as many as you want, but 
please be honest, they must be persons 
who will always answer back, 
regardless of who mails them a letter, 
persons you feel wouldn't just stop 
swapping on a whim, etc. Those who 
will then appear on this little chart 
will need to have had atleast 3
recommendations from their contacts,
and this will not carry over to the
next issue, everybody will need 3
recommendations for each issue. Once
in however, I will try to write a bit
about each swapper, as well as
including his address, because that's
what it comes down to, finding
reliable swappers for you to swap with
:) So, mail me your suggestions, maybe
along with some words about each
recommendation, and we will see how
this chart looks the next time. As
always, there are some rules, you may
not recommend yourself BUT you may
recommend others from your group(s). 
That might seem unfair, but swappers
are a rare breed now, many are
concentrated into a select few groups,
like Apathy, so it would not be fair
if they couldn't recommend eachother,
since they might really deserve it. 
This time, only 6 people have made 
their recommendations, so it is a 
small start. Nevertheless, let us see 
who have gotten atleast 3 
recommendations for this time.

»CL9:1. Punisher (5)
»CL8:2. Darkhawk (4)
»CL7:3. Evan     (3)
»CL0:   Kempy    (3)
   Lahve    (3)
   Roover   (3)

»CL8:Now then, this might not seem like
much yet, but with more support, the
list will grow, if there's enough
reliable swappers, heh. It was very
interesting to note, that those 5
persons I asked (6, including myself)
did infact almost totally agree.
Punisher was recommended by everyone
asked, we can see, and that should
indicate that he is very trustworthy
indeed, so if you're one of the few
who do not swap with him, you know
what to do.. I got some notes from
some about these swappers here, so
let's just quote some of those, and
give you the address of these 6,
hopefully reliable, swappers now.






»CL8:Punisher/Darkage^Apathy
»CL9:-----------------------
»CL3:Angeldust about Punisher: »CL2:Maybe the 
most active swapper these days. And as 
I heard from several sources also the 
living swapmachine and hyperactive
maniac.

»CL3:Darkhawk about Punisher: »CL2:Well, the
best swapper around really, not much
to argue there, he's active, he's
friendly and he writes long letters.
You probably already swap with him
though, as it seems like everybody
does so, heh. 

»CL7:Jonas O'brien
Huvikveien 32b
3222 Sandefjord
Norway
»CL8:Darkhawk/IRIS
»CL9:-------------

»CL1:Punisher about Darkhawk: »CL0:One of the 
few old-schoolers left. Does only send 
out packages when IRIS releases 
something. Very friendly and long 
letters. One for the friendshippers 
out there! Contact him, and you will 
not be disappointed.

»CL1:Darkhawk about ehh..: »CL0:Well, I just
wanted to add that I'm not completely
100% reliable if you are a new contact
writing a letter to me, sorry. I
mainly want to swap because of the
letter and the friendship, the stuff
comes second (third) for me, so if you
do not share my view of letters and
friendship (that is, writing a short
letter, telling me that the stuff is
everything, etc.) I MIGHT not reply 
to you, because I'm so evil and 
arrogant, hehe. Otherwise, I guarantee
you that I'm reliable.. Really ;)

»CL8:Evan/Nah-Kolor^MAWI
»CL9:-------------------

»CL3:Punisher about Evan: »CL2:I remember 
Marcin when he was a member of 
Apathy. At that time he wasn't as 
known as he is today! Now almost 
every swapper have heard about this
guy, and it's no shock why he is a 
member of both MAWI and Nah-Kolor.
Does also compile the well known 
SPEED-PACK. Reliable and friendly, 
but ELITE only.

»CL3:Darkhawk about Evan: »CL2:Well, I've
swapped with Evan for some years now,
and he is always reliable in his
sendings, with a nice letter, fresh 
stuff, and often his own pack, Speed, 
so he's a good and stable swapper for 
sure.

»CL8:Kempy/Veezya
»CL9:------------
»CL1:Punisher about Kempy: »CL0:This is 
probably the best swapper in 
Poland today. He's fast, he's 
friendly, he's skilled in other areas 
than swapping, he has lot's of 
contacts, huge collection of software 
and he writes long letters! This is 
probably one of those that will rule 
the future swapping scene. This is 
proven by a huge interest in learning 
Norwegian (huh'? So, by learning
norwegian, one becomes the best
swapper? Who'd have thought? ;) - DH)

»CL7:Przemek Kowalczyk
Kopernika 13/14
34-100 Wadowice
Poland
»CL8:Lahve/Reason
»CL9:------------

»CL3:Darkhawk about Lahve: »CL2:One of my newer
contacts, and a positive surprise from
all those '2 delayed sends, then
silence' swappers. Lahve sends back
quite fast, writes long and
interesting letters, and even has his
own pack, Sabotage, which is only
spread via swapping, so what are you
waiting for? Contact him now :)

»CL8:Roover/Nah-Kolor
»CL9:----------------
»CL1:Punisher about Roover: »CL0:Jarek from 
Poland is a friendshipper and an 
enemy of IRC. He has a very nice 
girlfriend, and if you contact him, 
I'm sure you will know what I'm 
talking about. Beside this, he always 
writes interesting letters, and is 
very, very fast.
»CL1:Evan about Roover: »CL0:He writes long and
interesting letters, and is a great
person to party with!

not get enough recommendations are:

»CL0:I hope to get support from a little
more swappers next time around, feel
free to email me your recommendations
and maybe a word or two about them, to
darkhawk@gmx.net, or simply get in
touch via good oldfashioned mail
instead. Feedback, praises, criticism
and suggestions for this small,
alternative chart are welcome too!
