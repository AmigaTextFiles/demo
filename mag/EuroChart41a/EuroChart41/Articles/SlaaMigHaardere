»CL8:The remaining ones
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Being a part of the Danish Amiga scene
requires that you attend the only
party left in Denmark for it.
Therefore, I went the long way from
Geneva (Switzerland) to Odense
(Denmark) to be with the bold heros:
The defenders of the Amiga. But who
are these people? Well, they include
Loonies, Depth, IRIS, Cromatics,
Søhesten, Spoon, Gunnars Farve Bio and
Focus Design. Unfortunately, not all
of them were present at this small
party, but due to some groupless
people and a single Norwegian Gods
fellow (who refused to acknowledge the
fact that Danish and Norwegians can
speak their own languages to each
other - shame on your Nordic roots,
Zerox), the number of attenders did
reach about 40. A small group
dedicated to hail their beloved Amigas
for some time.

»CL8:Demo Show # 1
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL0:The mainorganisers, IRIS, were very
happy with their big screen, which
resulted in demo shows already the
first night. This show resulted in
some massive headbanging, started by
Darkhawk himself, but it didn't take
long for the crowd to follow the
trend. It was a blast - especially
standing next to it and enjoying that
we all admire the coding/design skills
of The Spy even now, nine years after
Hardwired.

»CL8:Compo time
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL0:As for compos, enthusiasm was quite
moderate. No killer modules were
delivered, a few nice pixel arts were
seen, and for the demo compo, the IRIS
coder, Tricktrax, managed to resource
some old stuff from his HD into a nice
demo. Luckily, Loonies had it in them
to have a couple of nice and new
effects in their demo. And one thing's
for sure: Timing and Loonies go
together like mouse and cat-food.

»CL8:BBQ & Demo Show # 2
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL0:More cosiness was to be lived during
day two - as the weather went from
showery to quite sunny. Quickly, a BBQ
was set up. Nothing like the pleasures
of free food (I wonder who paid
that!). Admittedly, the Danish summer
is not at all as good as the Swiss,
but that Saturday night was definitely
bearable. Of course it all ended in
another demo show. This time with
Adonis/IRIS as demo master. This
resulted in some mainly
Polish/Hungarian productions. Very
nice, but few attenders though (i.e.
only me and Adonis).



»CL8:Prize Giving
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL0:Prizes we're given the Sunday. No
suprises here: Loonies took the gold
and the 500 DKK - not much for a first
prize, but still - scale it with the
attenders at TP, and you get around
6000 Euro - I dig it.

»CL8:See you next year
»CL9:--------------------------------------
»CL0:In general, Scene Meeting has turned
out to become a gathering of friends
in love with their computer. Old
friends visiting each other to have a
nice weekend and at least TRY to be a
little bit active - which can be hard
in this cosy atmosphere. I look
forward to the next SM (this time,
I'll have to come all the way from
Berlin... tsk tsk). Well done, IRIS.
Well done, DK Scene!
