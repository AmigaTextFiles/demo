           »CL4:by Bucko/Depth

»CL0:In the days when Amiga ruled the
desktop it seemed a bizarre concept
indeed that one day we would all own
PC`s and some breed of next generation
games console. Like it or not, that's
now the scenario. Interesting times
are ahead for owners and manufacturers
of games consoles, with the second
wave of 3D consoles now entering the
market, new concepts such as easy
multi-user gaming and digital
convergence sees the leading games
companies struggle to innovate and
impress the consumer with new features
and ideas. (why can't this be the OS
market I'm talking about? :) )

»CL8:It seems fair to talk about Sega
first, since the Dreamcast was the
first machine launched that could be
truly called next generation. Powered
by a RISC Hitachi SH4 CPU a powerful
beast that can outperform most Intel
clone CPUs at around 4 times the clock
speed. The Hitachi is optimised for
floating point operations essential to
3D graphics. The graphics chip is a
Videologic PowerVR CLX1 graphics
processor. The unit has a maximum
polygon count of 4 million, although 2
million is a more realistic limit. The
machine also has 16mb RAM and 8mb
video ram, and of course ships with a
56k modem. Sega have also virtually
managed to eliminate piracy by using a
special CD format called GD-ROM, which
is like a high-density version of the
original CD-ROM standard. (Although
the first pirate Dreamcast games are
now emerging) Dreamcast games can
store up to 800mb on a GD-ROM,
needless to say, these disks wont be
easy to duplicate in any conventional
CD burner. The machine also uses a
version of Windows CE, this was done
mainly in the hope of attracting
Windows developers to the platform,
although so far there are no products
that use the operating system.





»CL7:Sega has an impressive product, one
that is significantly easier to
develop for than the Saturn, a head
start of over a year on Sony and the
potential to kick start the online
gaming revolution, or rather it had.
What exactly went wrong? The
Dreamcast's poor performance cannot be
attributed to any one factor, but a
number of miss-haps and mistakes by
Sega have hampered the performance of
what could have been another
mega-drive. The delays in launching
the product was the first blow to the
Dreamcast dream, many who put a
deposit down on a machine were
disappointed, sometimes several times.
Secondly, the online side of Dreamcast
has disappointed many users, many
countries still cannot access basic
internet facilities such as the web
through their Dreamcasts. Online games
have been slow to emerge, only now
have the first few Internet enabled
games appeared. Many potential buyers
have been put off by the lack of
software, there are great games on the
Dreamcast, but its early line up was
weak and many people have given up on
the machine and are simply not
listening, great games are now
emerging, such as Furr Fighters,
Shenmue and Power Stone, and a bulk of
the public remains completely
ignorant. Effectively Sega now has a
console that appeals only to hardcore
gamers and not the mainstream, like
the Playstation does. Software support
in the form of Quake 3, Black and
White and Ferrari 355 challenge, all
soon to be released, and all (bar
possibly 355 challenge) to include
multiplayer online modes, may see
sales increase, Sega at least remains
comitted to the machine, despite the
damning sales figures of Playstation 2
(see next paragraph) ensuring that
this time it shouldnt loose too much
face with its dedicated fans.

»CL9:PSX - II

»CL0:Sony Playstation 2. Perhaps the only
marketing Sony needed in order to
shift a record amount of consoles. On
average, Sony shifts 45,455
Playstation 2`s per day in Japan,
compared with 8,145 Dreamcasts sold by
the Sega camp. Already, total sales of
Playstation 2 have overtaken
Dreamcast, pretty damning news for
Sega and its supporters. Technical
specifications on the Sony machine
remain difficult to confirm, however,
it is pretty widely accepted that
there is definitely a C factor in
there.



»CL9:The C factor

»CL0:The C factor, named after the big C,
who produced many machines with this
feature is the name I invented for
hardware that has an almost `magical`
edge to it. Computers featuring the C
factor include the Commodore 64, the
Amiga and the Sega Saturn. The
Commodore 64, for example, was
supposedly limited to 16 colours, and
yet many programmers pushed that to 32
or more. The number of sprites was
supposedly limited to around 8, yet
many games had 16 or more. It is for
this reason that the Amiga and C64 are
some of the greatest scene computers
ever made. In a recent interview with
Edge magazine, Phil Harrison,
development director at Sony, hinted
at the true potential of the machines
power, amongst the things that were
discussed were random yet ordered
texturing and environments, imagine
entering a dungeon where each brick is
weathered slightly differently, and
yet each one retains the same
characteristics when you return. It's
not like its a slightly different
version of what we had on Playstation
1, it's not like its a different
version of what we saw on other games
systems of in the PC. It's a brand new
piece of technology. Once programmers
come to terms with this technology, we
can expect some really groundbreaking
games.



»CL8:In the meantime, however, PSX2
continues to fail to impress. The
games that launched with the console
have been described as some of the
weakest launch titles in console
history, Tekken Tag Tournament failed
to deliver anything significantly new
over previous versions, Ridge Racer 5
is supposedly no better than previous
installs (although not having had the
chance to play it yet I cannot
comment). The fact that the machine is
lacking a triple A title seems not to
matter to Japanese gamers who are
lapping up the machines as quickly as
Sony can churn them out, indeed it
seems that after PSX1, Sony can do no
wrong. How long this honeymoon period
will last is a mystery, but with a
reported 275 titles in development, it
seems unlikely that it will be long
before Sonys critics are silenced and
the Playstation 2 finally has a killer
title or two.

»CL9:The Microsoft factor

»CL0:William Gates, a man who is rarely out
of the news, decided that the millions
he was making in the personal computer
market was not enough and that a
Microsoft games console would be a
great idea. The machine is scheduled
for an Autumn 2001 release. Already
there are big name developers on
board, including EA and Konami. The
unit is said to have 3 times the
graphics power of a Playstation 2 and
is powered by a 600mhz X86 CPU.
Bizarrely, or perhaps not considering
that this is a Microsoft product, the
unit will ship with a 8gb hard drive.
X-Box`s trumph card could well be its
unified memory architecture, which
effectively allows programmers to
split the system memory any way they
see fit between video, audio and other
code such as physics etc. With Nvidia
on hand to provide the graphics card
support, expect the machine to have
some serious poly-pushing power. The
machines main weakness lies in its
relatively slow CPU, which may be on
par with the Dreamcasts unit. Why
Microsoft chose x86 when better
price/performance solutions are
available is something of a mystery,
perhaps they wish to guarantee that PC
games are very easy to port, although
having games which run on both PC and
X-Box will mean some changes need to
be made to the current PC situation
with regards joy pad support
particularly.

X-box has generated a lot of
scepticism, largely due to the fact
that it seems to be a PC in games
console's clothing. Considering the
machine uses Windows and an X86 CPU,
it's hard not to see how Gates could
have made a more powerful machine for
the same price. Microsoft does have a
huge amount of resources to draw on,
however, and it would be foolish to
write them off altogether.

»CL9:Nintendo

»CL0:Gotta catch `em all, or not, depending
on weather you can't get enough of
Pokemon or you want to grind Pikachu
and friends into a bloody pulp.
Personally I am the former, and so to
me at least, the possibilities of
Nintendo`s new machine, the Dolphin,
are very exciting. Nintendo have
revealed very little about the new
machine, the CPU is supposedly a RISC
based number crunching beast
manufactured by IBM, and for the first
time in history the cartridge format
will not be used by this Nintendo
console. Instead, a DVD drive will
play host to the next generation of
Nintendo products.

Nintendo is blessed with some of the
greatest game designers in the world,
indeed Pokemon Stadium single handily
bought the N64 back from the brink of
extinction in the eyes of many gamers.
(I would by one myself but I`m sure if
I buy another console my family will
disown me) While details regarding
Dolphin and Gameboy Advance remain
difficult to come by, Nintendo fans
are quietly excited, the big N should
have learned by its mistakes this time
around, and we should be able to
expect a much larger range of games,
including titles for mature gamers, as
well as the family and younger player
orientated games Nintendo does so
well.


»CL9:Killer Titles

»CL0:For those of you who can afford a
Dreamcast and a Playstation 2, there
are some really fun times ahead, if
your budget only stretches to one, I`d
have to say the Dreamcast currently
has more great titles, both in
development and already released. The
situation could well change in the new
year, however. Here are some that may
make your Christmas wish list.

»CL1:Jet Set Radio (Dreamcast Sega)

»CL0:Featuring the funkiest looking visuals
yet seen on a next generation console,
Jet Set Radio could win Sega a great
many friends. The game involves
skating around `tagging` (read
vandalizing) the landscape while
avoiding the police. Sure to stir some
controversy too.

»CL1:Super Runabout (Dreamcast - Climax)

»CL0:Sequel to the likeable but ultimately
disappointing Felony 1179, this game
will benefit greatly from the
Dreamcast's greater Polygon pushing
power. For those not familiar with the
original, the game is best described
as a ram-raiding simulator. After
stealing various artefacts you must
run from the police and reach the
checkpoint in time.




»CL1:Ferrari 355 Challenge (Dreamcast Sega)

»CL0:Yu Suzuki`s cutting edge driving
simulator took arcade players breath
away, with its extravagant 3 screen
cabinet and authentic sampled sounds.
The original coin-op ran on 4 Naomi
boards, considering one is more
powerful than a Dreamcast, early shots
show a surprising abundance of
graphical detail (admittedly the
coin-op did also power 3 screens) If
playability is maintained, Ferrari
lovers will lap this up.






»CL1:Ferrari 360 Challenge
(Playstation 2 Acclaim)

»CL0:The worlds greatest sports car
manufacturer, the worlds greatest
console, and what is already looking
like being the PSX-2 greatest driving
game. Huge amounts of work have gone
into the AI of the computer drivers,
with each one promised its own
personality, the Tifosi never had it
so good.








»CL1:Shenmue
(Dreamcast Sega)

»CL0:Re-writing the concept of an RPG,
Shenmue is a total life simulator;
fortunately you are playing someone
with an interesting life. Already
critically acclaimed in Japan, and
featuring attention to detail
previously unseen in any game, RPG
owning Dreamcast fans are »PIC:EN208x79x64»
in for a treat when
the English
version
finally
makes
it
out.


»CL1:Time Splinters
(Playstation 2 Free Radical Software)

»CL0:   A Third person shooter coded by the
 team responsible for the original N64
    Goldeneye? Should be enough to get
              people salivating. Early
                 screenshots look good
                  but not outstanding.
                        Nevertheless a
                               game to
                                watch.








»CL1:The Getaway
(Playstation 2 Sony)

»CL0:If anyone knows how to program PSX-2
properly, it should be Sony.
Early screenshots
show levels of
graphical detail               »PIC:Darklight.+EC_03.iff» 
that gamers dream
only dare dream
of, wether these
are actual
screenshots or
demonstration
renders remains
to be seen, but
70 square kilometres of London to
practice high speed crime should make
for an entertaining experience.

»CL1:               Metropolis Street Racer
                         (? Dreamcast)

»CL0:            Another impressive looking
      street racer, this time on Segas
            box. Early screenshots are
                           impressive,
                               and the
                               waiting
                             is almost
                                 over.
                              Expect a
                           full review
                               of this
                           beauty when
                             I finally
                           get hold of
         a Dreamcast later this month!
