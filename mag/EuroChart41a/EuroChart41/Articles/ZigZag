»CL1:Wade:»CL0: That's a nasty trip you had
      there. You should really look
where you're going.

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: The time is 00.22, June 1st,
      2000. I have present, a member
of the infamous racketeers dubbed
Floppy. Goes by the name Zig.  

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: For the sake of the tape
      recorder, please state your name
in full.

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: Gajos Wojciech.

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: I understand you call yourself a
      coder.

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: What's the word on the street?
      How's the scene in Poland?

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: It's OK for me. There are several
     groups which are very good at
"sceneing", eg. Potion or Anadune.
They made the party-competition more
exciting.

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: What is this? Is this device
      intended to simplify your
activities?

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: I don't know really. But I bought
     it because I guess so.

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: This here is a deadly weapon.
      Hundreds of sceners die each
year, as a result of devices like
these.

use 30 or older cpus, amiga would be
probably in much worse position that
it is now.

     is a deadly weapon. The             Why should anyone wish to use a

Surely the best way to

the same possibilities. The
demos (amiga and pc) will          »CL1:Wade:»CL0: Okay. So what are your

of much powerful cpus and          »CL3:Zig:»CL2: I didn't buy it to win
graphics cards.                    competitions. But truly I thought
                                   about it.




















»CL1:Wade:»CL0: You're lying. I want the truth.
      Do you or do you not believe a
PPC will give you an unfair advantage?

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: I found out that it doesn't
     matter on what cpu (hardware)
your demo was coded. It's all about
how it looks like. And if it looks
cool and people like it - you win. But
PPC could help to make much complex
effects at the same frame-rate and if
you asked about it - the answer is yes.

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: Do you ever profit from these
      violations?
»CL3:Zig:»CL2: I won a little money. But not
     much. I don't code to earn money.
I do it  for fun. And for Amiga users'
pleasure, for better productions on
parties.
»CL1:Wade:»CL0: So, let me get this straight.
      You code only for parties? 

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: At this time - yes.

»CL9:<»CL1:Wade sighs disdainfully»CL9:>»

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: It sounds to me as if you are
      driven by profit and gain. Does
this motivate your work? 

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: That's true. But this is not the
     only thing that make coders work
harder, the other one is to be a well
known and respected coder.







»CL1:Wade:»CL0: Tell me about your accomplices:
      the graphics artists and
musicians behind your schemes. Do they
work for you or with you? 

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: Not actually the way I want it. I
     get some graphics and musics. 
Then I sit, listen to the music, think
about gfx and code I have and that's 
where the design comes from. Then I
code a demo, change my plans during it
and... Next FLOPPY release. But it
shouldn't be that way. I want to
change it.






»CL1:Wade:»CL0: You mentioned design. Surely
      this should be an essential
ingredient in order for your plans to
succeed. Should a coder dedicate more
time on designing their production? 

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: In Floppy, when Thorus was a
     member, I spent my time on coding
and he spent his time on design. Now,
I spend my time on coding, and the
rest (very small) on design. But I
guess the first place takes DESIGN,
and the second - CODING.





»CL1:Wade:»CL0: You seem to promote            »PIC:Darklight.+EC_13.iff»
      the Amiga scene, but
have you ever considered
using your talents to help
others? Providing them with
magazine engines, music demos
or slideshows for instance,
so that they too can aid the
scene.

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: I coded a long time
     ago, but never
released...

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: So, if you could
     improve the scene, how
would you do it?
»CL3:Zig:»CL2: Make the Amiga
     hardware cheaper. Then
many good Amiga-sceners, which bought PCs, would return.




















»CL1:Wade:»CL0: I too would like to see that
      happen. But, restrictions are a
fundamental part of the Amiga's
success. It's what drove sceners of
the past, the toils of working within
a 1mb limit and a couple of floppy
disks. One could appreciate their work
more, knowing the boundaries they had
managed to exceed. These days, there
are no limits and the coder has far
less  difficulty achieving his/her
goals. 

»CL9:<»CL1:Zig shakes his head disapprovingly»CL9:>»

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: I don't think so. Coders
     concentrate their abilities on
other stuff then. The new demos are
very professional programs which show
users the possibilities of the
machine. That's what most people want.
And memory (hardware) is not problem
now. So why not use it, if you can?
Can you imagine a demo written on
a1200 without turbo and fast-ram
nowadays?

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: Absolutely. If there were more
      standard AGA demos, I'm sure
many ex-sceners would have remained in
the scene. 

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: For example. It's not possible to
     create c2p for 15bit truecolor
that will be faster than chip-writing
and preloading cache trick. So if i
got that speed, what is there to
speed-up? 


»CL1:Wade:»CL0: Take Sanity's Arte as an
      example. Even in this day and
age, it remains one of the greatest
demos the Amiga has ever seen, and it
only requires an A500 to run. 

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: That's true. But would you like a
     demo like Arte released this
year?

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: Definitely. It would certainly
      motivate my scene activities.
The beauty of such demos is that they
are designed purely for the Amiga,
using it's custom hardware to the
full. It takes a pretty powerful PC to
emulate a demo such as Arte, whereas a
simple 486 could handle most Amiga
demos of today's era. 

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: I don't think so. The times go by
     so the technique too. Better CPU
(hardware) doesn't change the coder
(man).

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: What about the challenge? Don't
      coders thrive on that any more?
One hardly needs much in the way of
low level coding expertise to program
a PPC demo. It's speed could make an
Amos demo look passable. 

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: That's right, but it depends on
     what do you want to achieve. I
can't do anything more on 060 so I
bought PPC card and BVision. There are
some limits you can't beat. Especially
AGA and slow BUS.

»CL9:<»CL1:Wade sighs»CL9:>»

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: Have you ever stolen other
      people's work? I.e. source code
and routines. 

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: Never rip. I don't like using
     other people's sources. I write
my own sources few times, cause I
don't like to use old stuff. All my
demos might look similar, but the code
in each other is completely new or
updated.

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: Do you have any plans for the
      future?

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: Currently no, but I think about a
     demo for BVision. Maybe a version
for MC68060 and AGA too. But time will
show what I do.

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: This is where you stand. In the
      very least, you are facing the
following charges: possession of a
deadly weapon, aiding and abetting,
fraud, and last but not least,
involuntary manslaughter. However, I'm
willing to make a deal. I will grant
you your freedom on one condition...

»CL9:<»CL1:Zig leans forward and gives an
 enquiring look»CL9:>»

»CL1:Wade:»CL0: I want the names of your mentors
      and accomplices. 

»CL3:Zig:»CL2: I got some friends in Poland,
     like Mr Acryl, Maq, Elf, Klod,
Informer, Skip, Mavey (who did I miss
:) I like Antibyte, Boogeyman, Jamie,
Psycho and many others, which I don't
remember now. They are great and I
love them ;)
