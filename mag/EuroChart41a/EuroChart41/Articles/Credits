»CL0:Credits for issue #41 of the
Eurochart goes like this..

Code is the same as ever, meaning that
»CL1:Quedax» and »CL1:Cytron», both of »CL1:Depth» did
it. 

Graphics in this issue is this time
completely done by »CL1:Slayer» of »CL1:Appendix»,
and isn't it great? »CL6:(Oh, yes! -CTN)»

The first module was done by »CL1:Curt 
Cool of Depth», the second one by 
»CL1:Estrayk» and »CL1:Evelred» of »CL1:Paradox» 
and »CL1:Capsule».

Overall EC organizing was done by
»CL1:Darkhawk» »CL6:(dunno' what that means, I
have done no such thing, heh)»,
the gallery and votecounting was done
by »CL1:Curt Cool», the news were collected 
by »CL1:Adonis» of »CL1:IRIS», adverts by »CL1:MJ» and 
the hard and boring slavelabour was 
done by »CL1:Cytron», as usual. 

The Scene Birthdays article is out, 
and will likely not reappear. It is a
nice idea, but we don't have anyone 
who wants to keep it updated, so..

Articles were of course done by the
maineditors, »CL1:Curt Cool», »CL1:Cytron» and 
»CL1:Darkhawk», but apart from that, the
following people supported us with
articles: 

»CL0:       »CL8:Bucko/Depth

»CL0:A huge »CL9:THANK YOU» must go to our voters
too, for taking the time for voting,
and supporting this chart, and thereby
suppoting the scene. Sadly there have
been a lot fewer voters this time than
in the last issue, and we hope you
will all take the huge and insane 
amount of time needed for voting next 
time, so that we can again come up
over a 100 votes! For this issue, we
had 83 votes.
