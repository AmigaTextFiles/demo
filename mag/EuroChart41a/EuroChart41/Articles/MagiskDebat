»CL0:Please understand I don't want to be
responsible for a bloody warzone, I
just want to air MY thoughts on a
recent article about the Polish scene
written by Wade/ex-Scoopex in Devotion
issue 1. In the article Wade explains
in a rather agressive style that the
charts in the EC don't reflect the way
of the scene of today especially the
places held by Polish groups, sceners
and productions.. Wade's conclusions
are quite right in his article but the
causes are in my opinion different.
My knowhow of the Polish scene goes
way back as 1993 so I do think I am
capable to make some judgements here..
;)


»CL9:The Eye Of The Tiger..
»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL7:We have to recognise the fact that the
Polish scene is really huge in numbers
of sceners and productions compared to
the rest of the Amiga Scene anno
domini 2000. We have to recognise the
fact that because of the size of the
Polish scene their is a certain
domination at work. And I don't mean
that someone or some group is doing
this on purpose.. When Poland has e.g.
100 swappers and the rest of the scene
e.g. 40 it's understandable that the
list of voters in an EC issue has more
voters from Polish origin. (Swapper's
are mostly the sceners who vote) And
not what Wade stated: "I am blatantly
accusing Polish sceners of
vote-fixing: voting for friends and
fellow Poles and attempting to
monopolize the charts"

It's also the responsibility of the EC
staff to make the EC a reflection of
today's scene. They should let an
equal amount of scener's vote looking
at country to overcome this problem.
The fact that Poland has so many
active sceners should not be the
excuse that Poland is trying to
monopolise the charts. Poland can't
help it that it has such a huge scene
today compared to the western scene.

»CL9:The Editor's Chart..
»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL7:I can feel along with Wade when he
say's that Azzaro doesn't deserve a
place above RokDazone, Sane, Soda or
Ghandy.. But in all fairness what the
hell is RokDaZone doing in the EC
today? He hasn't written anything for
over 2 years now.. Same for Soda.. The
fact the Azzaro is writing in Polish
doesn't mean he isn't a skilled
writer, who masters various writing
styles can do great interviews and
reviews. (written in all objectivity
since I can't read Polish) but the
misunderstanding here is that the
editor chart in the EC is judged on
English language something most Polish
sceners don't master. Again a job for
the EC staff to do something about.
Split it up into best English writer
and best Polish writer for example..
Or just make clearer than before that
the editor chart in the EC is based on
ENGLISH language and not the Polish
language!! 

»CL9:A General Look..
»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL7:In general Wade's statement is that
Polish writer's and productions don't
deserve the high ranking's in the EC.
And that he blames the Poles on
vote-fixing. The fact that Polish
writers and productions are so high is
because most voters are from Polish
origin. Their taste can't be argued
about; Voters can vote on what they
like no matter if it are Polish
productions.. Wade is a qualified
writer, he uses the so called 'Freedom
of the press' argument to legalise his
agressive style of writing in his
article; Yet I think that a little
more objectivity should been in it's
place here since the subject he wrote
about is quite sensitive.. Wade also
stated that: "Could it be, after years
of underdog status in the scene, that
they hunger for control ?"
A ridiculous sentence. It's like
Poland is a living scener out for
food. Poland is just a big and active
scene country and that's why they have
a somewhat dominating character.


»CL9:Poland On Top
»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL7:We all know by now that Poland is on
top. The biggest scene of all. The
most active scene of all. The scene
with the best hardware.. We should
cherish it.. But more than ever we
should reckognise it. And not in a
negative way. Poland influences the
western scene as we have seen by now;
We have to adapt a little to this
knowledge and I am sure we can live
next to eachother.. The Amiga Scene
was always based on friendship why
would we ruin it when we have come all
this far already even into the new
century ? Better hardware doesn't make
a better demo there are more aspects
in a demo to judge what is best. If
most Polish coders code on upgraded


    »PIC:Darklight.+EC_13.iff»













Amiga's then it's up to the rest of
the scene to upgrade as well. And not
say we are the best because all Poland
can do is release 060 and PPC demos..

»CL8:--------------------------------------
»CL7:My advice to solve the 'EC Problem'
goes to the EC staff: The voters in
the EC should be equalised. Not for
example 80 Polish voters and 20
non-Polish voters but an even amount.
Then you get a good reflection of
today's scene in the EC. And of course
the editor and diskmag charts. Only
English writers and diskmags? Or also
Polish? Split it up into 2 different
charts? When this is solved you at
least won't get those quarrels about
who or what is best in my eyes because
the EC doesn't reflect it in my eyes..
It's a harder job for the EC but a
better cause in whole for the Amiga
Scene..
