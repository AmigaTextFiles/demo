                     APPENDIX has the honour to invite
          all AMiGA, C64 and PC users to the orbital scene party:

                    S  A  T  E  L  L  I  T  E   ' 98
                   ----------------------------------

1. Intro
   ~~~~~
We  would like to inform you that the situation of our party has completely
changed  (for  better).  We intend to organize a party with inspiration and
will  do  our  best  to  improve this second one in Szczecin.  Remember:  »
COMMERCE  SUCKS  «.  We guarantee our party will not remind a computer fair
and  there will be no Little Green Men (in other words:  scouts) - gELLOVIN
lURES)

2. General rules
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Beer and snack bar will be well organized and you will not have to go for a
prey  to  the  city  (although  we  encourage you to sightsee it, anyway :)
Alcohol  and  other things that can make you happy (maybe except sodomy and
mutilation  :)  are also ALLOWED!  We hope there will be no demolition acts
and  we  will  not have to throw anybody out of the party place.  We do not
want to be so strict like at TheParty, though.

_PrOfEsSiOnAl  security  will  be  hired,  present  and  instructed what is
allowed to them.

3. Where?  (when... we will tell you later)
   ~~~~~~
The   party   will   be  held  in  the  Zespol  Szkol  Budowlanych  gym  in
Szczecin/Poland  (about  100km from Berlin/Germany) at Unislawy St.  32/33.
We  will  give  the  detailed  description  how  to  get there in the final
invitation  (maps,  pictures, maybe even a movie :).  The same maps will be
placed  on  the way from the rail station to party place.  The date has not
yet been set.  We think about the first weekend of November (7-8.11.98).

4. How much ?
   ~~~~~~~~~~

Enter  fee  will be terribly low and will not exceed 30PLN (for today it is
less than 10$ and 15DM).  Foreigners, chicks and Marek Pampuch :D enter for
FREE.   Track  suit  wearers  (especially  "adibas",  "sofix" and "sprandi"
brands)  will have 1 PLN discount, five minutes on the stage and free kicks
from the organizers...

6. Party formula
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We  will  not  follow other party organizers and not use the bigscreen (are
they afraid of electricity bills?).  It will display all the time important
information  and  upcoming  events  (like it was at the IO1&2 parties).  We
hope you not to leave us in the alcoholic trance like it happened at one of
the last parties).  We plan techno (not dance!!!) band to play all the time
live, unplugged (joke again :)


There will be several rooms for the party: mail hall and smailler ones
(manga room, sleeping room and delirium room with free entrance! :)

7. Prizes ?
   ~~~~~~~~
Will  be there!  We do not know yet how high they will be because it is too
early to say but we will do our best to get the highest prizes we can...
