    | Some non-sense stuff |
    `----------------------'

    Welcome to the second english issue...  This is a text with some little
bugs  and  features  we  got in the mag and how to avoid (or have fun) with
them...   Please,  enjoy the mag and of course support and spread it around
the  world...   See  you  in  the  next issue of your new diskmag choice...
Trashcan!.  Bye!  :)

    .--------------------.
    | How to run the mag |
    `--------------------'

    Boot  from  disk one and you will see.  We added some texts so that the
mag  tells  you  when to swap disks.  In case you got tge files spread over
many  archives,  these are the files that go in each disk, along with their
diskname.   In  case  you  downloaded  from aminet, then you don't have the
needed  workbench  1.3  commands and files.  We can supply you with them if
you  need  to.   Also  included  is  a  small  bootblock installer coded by
Touchstone/Essence.   This  bootblock  is real cool and also works on a500!
:)

    | How to Install the mag |
    `------------------------'

    Installing  the  mag  to HD is real easy.  Just copy all the files into
the same directory and the run the executable.

    .----------------.
    | Hardware Stuff |
    `----------------'

    We  executed  Trashcan on many configs and it ran on all of them.  Most
of  the  test were done with all the OS loaded, with DOpus running and also
with  lots of patches.  Notice that this includes, of course, a500 with one
meg of memory and 1 disk drive.

    .---------------------.
    | Exiting to AmigaDOS |
    `---------------------'

    In case you want to exit back to the system, just press Esc while being
on the index page.

    .-------------.
    | Little Bugs |
    `-------------'

    Most  bugs from the last issue have been debugged.  However, we have to
tell  you  that you should not press Amiga+M because then the AmigaDOS will
get a bit confused.

    .------------.
    | More Words |
    `------------'

    Sorry for the delay, but we had a lot of stuff running besides the mag.
We will try to bring the next one faster :)


                                                            Best Regards
