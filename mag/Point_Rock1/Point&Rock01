@Node Point "What is Point & Rock"

Point & Rock is "Yet Another DiscMag" about  music. But it will speak
about  Hard  Rock and  only Hard  Rock. I will  try  to provide you a
complete  information  on this subject, but as other discmags, I need
@{b}YOU@{ub}.

You can easily understand that the creation of a magazine is a lot of
work. So  if  you  want something  quite regular, you need some help.
This is where you can act.

Go on to the @{"Contribution" Link Contribution} section to check out what you can do.

@{b}Why this mag ?@{ub}

Music is  my  passion as well as  my Amiga. So, why not link together
these two passions and share it with all the community ?
Another fact  is that  I have not already seen this kind of Hard Rock
mag around the Aminet.
Third reason, I'm a belgian and it seems that the belgian Amiga Users
are not so productives  so I want  to contribute to fill this hole in
Amiga  Scene ( come  on  you  my  compatriots, let's  show'em   we're 
alive !!! )

Well, Point  & Rock  is born. Let's  see now how far it will go ! But
please let me know your impressions ( crap, mean, good, excellent ? )
just to improve the quality.

I don't know yet the  frequency of this mag, but I think that every 2
months is not a bad thing. Maybe  every  month (?). It will depend of
my studies and of you !!!

That's it for this editorial. 

Enjoy Point & Rock 1



                                         Raphaël ^ Mister No/aßS

@Node use "How to use it?"

Very  easy : you just have to point your mouse on each item you  want
to  read. The program will go to the part of the  mag  that interests
you. 
For the @{"vote form" Link Vote}, select print in the project menu and connect your
printer !!!

I have built  the mag while thinking that each time an information is
available  about a  band ( news, concert or anything else ), the name
would be highlighted. So each  time you  see a  button containing the
name of the band, a simple click will  give  you everything available
about it !

@Node credits "Credits and greetings"

This  issue of  Point & Rock has entirely been written  by me, myself

Müller ) for the next edition.

I want to salute the following persons for different reasons :

- Trax : Une  longue  histoire  entre  nous. Que  penses-tu  de cette
         édition ? Je sais que t'es pas trop Hard, mais que dirais-tu
         d'une collaboration à ce mag ?

           please ya. Thanx 4 PackNo 3.
                 
- TMCS : Je sais que tu vas @{u}ENCORE@{uu} trouver à redire sur ce mag, alors
         je  le  fais  à ta place : c'est nul ton machin ! ( De toute
         manière, Mister No is the best alors prout !!! ).
         
- Ralph Müller : toi  qui  ne  liras jamais ce mag car tu n'as pas d'
                 Amiga ( nobody's perfect ), sache que  toute collabo
                 est la bienvenue. J'attends ton aide précieuse...
                 
- IO : Quoi de neuf à la rue bosse des fesses, euh Basse des Fosses ?
       Que penses-tu de mon nouveau bébé ? Si tu as  des  trucs  pour
       moi, n'hésite pas !
       
- Adonis : Another nice swapper ( only at the beginning with me but I
           hope 4 a long time ! ). Not yet 500 ??? But you can spread
           this sh.t all over the world. THANX.

# Final Words #
###############

@Node Final "Final Words"

You  finaly  reached  the  end  of  issue  #1  of  Point & Rock. This
experiment has been a pleasure for me. The ball  is now on your side.
I really hope you will catch it and send it back to me.

I need  you  to  continue. So  don't hesitate to send me whatever you
want :  adverts, concert  reports, album  tests, letter... Everything
will be used.
I wait your stuff, you Metallibashers, Irons and others.

Hard  Rock  is  a good  kind of  music. It provides us the power, the
key to express all the madness inside of us. But it  also can give us
the melody to let our  heart  explode ( nice sentence he ? ). Come on
tell me why you listen to this music, how you discovered it and since
when.

I give you a rendez-vous to the next edition of Point & Rock.

But  don't  forget : "Play  it  loud, don't  play  it  low, blow your
speakers with ROCK N ROLL" ( Manowar ).





                                Yours, 
                                Mister No ^ aßS

@Node Albums "Albums to listen"

@{b}WHITE ZOMBIE : Super Sexy Swinging Sounds@{ub}

This  CD  is an  album of remixes. The group has decided to  give the
bands  of Astro  Creep 2000 ( their last album ) to some DJ's in hope
to create other songs.
Some other  bands have already tried this. I think to @{"Metallica" Link Metallica} with
the single "Until it sleeps". Moby worked on  it one night to produce
a completely  revamped  song  and  I must say that  the  attempt is a
success.
White Zombie's case is other. Don't  expect  too much different songs
on this album. The order  of the songs changes  from Astro Creep 2000
but the vocal parts  are quite  the same. It's just  the beat  or the
arrangement  that are  different ( you  can  hear  some jungle beats,
dance, techno and so on ).
In fact, I can't say that this album is  bad 'coz the songs are quite
nice but  the principle  of the  remix is the  change  completely the
song and this is not really the case of this album.

@{u}The conclusion@{uu} : if you are open-minded, you  could perhaps listen to
Super Sexy Swinging Sounds, but  if  you're an  unconditional  fan of
pure Heavy, this is not for you !

My Quote : 6.5/10

@Node News "Nows and rumours"

@{b}Red Hot Chili Peppers@{ub}

They would be about splitting. Flea would  be waiting the end  of the
RHCP tour to give an end to the band.
It could  interest Axl  Rose 'coz he think to  engage Dave  Navaro in 
Guns N' roses.

@{b}Guns N' Roses@{ub}

They would be in studio at the time you read these lines. Maybe a new
album next year ???

@{b}@{"Iron Maiden" Link Maiden}@{ub}

A new single is  out  since the 9th of  September. It is called Virus
and it  prefigures a best  of ( out on the 23rd of september ) called
" Best of The Beast ".
The single  is available  in  three  different  formats : 
- CD1 : Virus + My Generation + Doctor, doctor
- CD2 : Virus + Sanctuary + Wrathchild
- LP 12" : Virus + Invasion + Prowler + poster bag

@{b}Van Halen@{ub}

Sammy  Haggar is  fired  and  replaced  by... David  Lee  Roth ! They
actualy are working on a best of and maybe a  tour is planned for the
next year !?
 
@{b}Rob Halford@{ub}

He has build a new band called " Halford " and should record an album
of industrial music.
A new Rob Reznor ( or Trent Halford ) ?
