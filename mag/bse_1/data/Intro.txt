@5   Hi  and welcome to issue one of Beyond Sanit-E - the diskazine which reaches
the  parts  others  cannot  reach (we hope!).  If you enjoy our mag then please
contribute  and  help us out as at the moment we don't have many people writing
for  us,  and  its a git having to write so many bloody text files.  As you may
have  found, we had to include some bloody boring people to write files to fill
our  pages,  so  if  you can write better crap than the crap that is NITE, then
please  please  please  do  so.   The  addresses  are  in  the  CONTACT  US and
CONRIBUTIONS  articles,  so  write to me or zYLAX and help us out on any of the
subjects  on our disk (or any other subject you would like other AMIGA users to
hear  about).   OK now more about the mag, we hope to release one issue every 2
to  3 months, or even sooner if the contributions are coming in thick and fast.
So  do  us proud as we try to cover as wide a range of subjects as possible but
it  is  quite  hard with only a handful of writers.  Anyway, thanks for reading
this little piece!
