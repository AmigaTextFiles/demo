@1Even  if  the  industry  seems  to  be  deserting  the Amiga at the moment, the
demo-scene  is  still  pumping  the machine with everything it's got.  You want
proof?  Then keep reading!

Mindfield  is  a music disk produced by the Megawatts group.  The demo comes on
three  disks  and consists of eight music tracks, which are as follows:  Intro,
Cubic,  Anestesia,  NXIcio,  Future  Shock  2,  Liverman Remix, Trip on Diz and
SlicEtasy.   The  tracks  vary  in  length and the entire demo lasts for around
forty-two minutes on long play.

All  the  tracks are heavily influenced by Techno which is the downfall of most
music disks of this type.  Techno is considered by many musicians as a degraded
form  of  music  and so a lot of it is badly made on the Amiga.  In Mindfield's
case  though,  the  music  is  of  a  very high quality.  The samples have been
digitized at a decent level and there is a real feeling that a lot of hard work
has gone into composing the music.

If  you  want  proof of the quality of this disk, don't insult it by playing it
though  your  TV  speaker, get your machine hooked up to a decent hi-fi system.
And,  another  thing.  As a test we recorded the soundtrack onto a cassette and
played it to someone without telling where it was sourced from.  Let's just say
they never guessed it was from a computer!

     @4   Do you want to hear what a ten-year old sound chip sounds like?

@1Sidewinder,  who  composed  the  soundtrack of the Mindfield demo has created a
music CD using sound ported directly from an Amiga.  Although the sound quality
has been improved with the use of a studio, it is mainly Amiga-generated music.
The tracks on the CD are as follows (with running time in minutes and seconds):
