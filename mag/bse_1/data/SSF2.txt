@4The  incredible has happened!  Super Street Fighter 2 has been converted to the
Amiga.

@1Not  having  had  the  chance  to play the Amiga version of the original Street
Fighter 2, I didn't know what to expect from this demo version (which came from
the  August issue of CU AMIGA, in case you were wondering).  The game, like the
original,  is  being  released  by US GOLD and the development team are a group
called FREESTYLE.

The  two  characters  included  in  the preview version are the small but swift
figure  of  CAMMY  vs.   the  might of the blubber mountain known as E.  HONDA.
Only  CAMMY  can  be  used  by  the  player  in  the  demo  and  E.   HONDA  is
computer-controlled.  At this point in development, it has to be said, that the
graphics  are  looking very rough, but US GOLD say that the look of the game is
still  being  improved.   One  of  the main problems of an Amiga conversion was
keeping the speed of the original, but this seems to have been retained well.

There will be a standard A500 version and an enhanced version for A1200 owners.

@4The  big question is can Super Street Fighter 2 make bigger blood stains on the
Amiga  beat'em'up  scene  than the current leaders:  MORTAL KOMBAT 2 and SHADOW
FIGHTER?
