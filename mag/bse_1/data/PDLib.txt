During  the  time  that  I've  owned an Amiga (which is around two years at the
moment)  I  have  used  various  PD  Libraries  to  get  the latest demo warez.
Fortunately, I have never been ripped off (..yet!) and as a way of saying thanx
to  the libraries concerned (as well as being a guide for potential PD buyers),
here  are some descriptions (or FREE ADVERTISING) of the four libraries I think
provide a good service with reasonable prices:
