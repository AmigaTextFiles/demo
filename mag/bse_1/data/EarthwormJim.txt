@4   What  a  guy!   But  will  he  ever  be  out on the Amiga?  Well if the next
generation  of  Amigas  are  good  enough,  I  don't see why not.  What has the
Megadrive  got  that the Amiga hasn't???  A flashy black case thats what!!!  It
should  be  simple  to recreate him, standard machines may lose some colour and
speed  (like  Cool  Spot  did)  but  1200 and 4000 owners should have a console
perfect game (probably).  Look at Aladdin and the Lion King, they both came out
on  consoles  first  and  came to the Amiga without losing any bloody colour or
speed at all.  The consoles argue that they don't have to swap disks but we say
so what, a little bit of disk swapping doesn't affect the gameplay now does it?
So shift your arses Shiney and let Virgin convert your best yet to the best yet
THE AMIGA.
   To  back  up  my  argument just look at games like Cool Spot, Desert Strike,
Micro  Machines, Crash Dummies (OK NOT that one), Dynablaster (Superbomberman),
FIFA  International  Soccer and the up and coming Super Streetfighter 2 to name
but  a  few.   OK, some were complete crap but not because of the computer, but
because  of  poor  programming.   So  if  they do convert it, let's hope its by
someone who knows what they are doing, thank you...
