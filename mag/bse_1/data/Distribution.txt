As  the  global  population  of  Amiga users hesitate before reaching for their
X-Copy's,  fearing  a  fate  worse than the wrath of God to befall them if they
disobey the mighty DISTRIBUTION RULEZ!!

Well, they aren't that bad!

Beyond Sanit-E proudly exclaims itself as FREELY DISTRIBUTABLE.  This means you
can  copy  it as many times as you like and for as many people as you what.  In
fact  we  want you to spread this magazine as much as possible, so you can mail
trade it, upload it to the Internet and any bulletin boards (BBS's) you like.

PD LIBRARIES: Although we intended this magazine to be free. We need you
              guys for distribution and so we'll change the rulez a little.
              You may sell this magazine on the conditions that the disk the
              magazine is on is sold for no more than ONE POUND AND FIFTY
              PENCE. (Of course, you can sell it as cheaply as you want.)
              We hope you agree this isn't too much to ask.

YOU MUST NOT CHANGE THE MAGAZINE IN ANY WAY!@1
If  you  want  to convert this magazine to a different format (eg PC or Mac) or
include  it  on  a  CD-ROM.   You  will  need our written permission first (our
addresses  are  in the articles @3CONTRIBUTIONS@1 and @3CONTACT US!@1).  Don't worry, I
shouldn't  think  that  we  will have any objections but we like to know what's
happening to our magazine.
