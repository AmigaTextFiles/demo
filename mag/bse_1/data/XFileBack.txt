    @4                  X-FILES - BACKGROUND AND CHARACTERS

  @5                              by zYLAX / PTK

@1Anybody,  whether  they are a sci-fi fan or just a casual TV viewer, can't have
failed  to  notice  the  success  of the X-Files.  Ever since BBC2 screened the
first  series it has been a huge hit with British viewers with over six million
watching  each  episode.   The  second  series  is  currently being shown every
Tuesday  night  on  SKY  ONE  (Bastards!!!!) and BBC 2 plans to broadcast it in
September (Yes!  Not long now!).

This  article  is intended to be a guide for anyone who hasn't seen or heard of
the  X-Files  (can't  be  many)  and  additional information to existing X-File
watchers (or X-Philes as I think they are called).



@3BACKGROUND INFORMATION

@4The  title of the programme (X-Files) refers to a series of FBI files involving
cases that could not be solved using conventional scientific theorys (you know,
aliens  and  supernatural  stuff).   The  plots  are  based  mainly  around the
character  of  Fox  'Spooky'  Mulder  who  despite  being an excellant agent is
ridiculed  by  the  higher  levels  of  the  FBI because of his interest in the
unknown  and  involvement  with  the  X-Files, which are deemed to be the least
important  of all the FBI's activities.  Agent Dana Scully was then assigned to
watch  over Mulder and produce reports to exposed the X-Files as a waste of FBI
resources and therefore gain enough information to cease further investigations
into  X-File  cases.   Needless  to  say,  this  failed to happen and the cases
continue...



@3MAIN CHARACTERS

@4Agent Fox 'Spooky' Mulder  [Played by David Duchovny]

@5Mulder  has always been a firm believer in the unexplained and is not afraid of
others  knowing  this  (which  is  the  basis  of  his nickname:  Spooky).  His
facination with the unknown began at an early age with the disappearance of his
sister, who he firmly believes was abducted by aliens.  He is an extremely good
agent  with  his  determination  to solve a case combined with his photographic
memory.


@4Agent Dana Scully [Played by Gillian Anderson]

@5The  main reason for Scully's involvement in the X-Files was to keep watch over
Mulder.  Because of this, she began by being very skeptical of any X-Files they
were  assigned to, always looking for a rational explaination.  Although, later
in the series she began to accept the unknown for what it was.




@4'Deep Throat' [Played by Jerry Hardin]

@5Little  is  known about this character, except he seems to hold a high position
in  the  US  Government  and has access to top secret information.  He has only
appeared  in  a few episodes, and his main purpose within the series is to leak
the  information he has to Mulder (although he often tries to warn him off some
cases).
