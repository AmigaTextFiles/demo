@1The  second  video  in  the  first season of Star Trek - Voyager to be released
contains  the  episodes  PARALLAX  and TIME AND AGAIN.  Both of these are based
around  the  concept  of time which sees to be a favourite subject of Star Trek
writers.  The film GENERATIONS is proof of this.

I  can't  remember  what  it  was  called  but Parallax reminds me of a similar
episode  of ST - The Next Generation.  After responding to a distress call, the
Voyager  and it's crew find that time and space is being distorted around them.
It  turns  out  that  the  distress  call  they recieved was from themselves in
another time (confusing stuff!).  Parallax is good enough if you're a Star Trek
fan, but just don't expect any surprises.

Time   and  Again,  the  second  time-y  episode,  sees  the  crew  of  Voyager
investigating  a  planet  which  has just been the victim of a devastating war,
which  wiped out the entire population.  While on the planet's surface, members
of  the  away team become trapped within temporal distortions, meaning they are
trapped  on  the  planet  in a time immediately before the war began.  Time and
Again  has  many  of the same faults of Parallax, in that it's all been done to
some extent before in previous Star Trek's.

Voyager  has  the  potential  to  become an excellent addition to the Star Trek
legend.   We just need a bit more originality!  (Although it's still well worth
buying.)
