Currently  you cannot print articles directly from Beyond Sanit-E.  But you can
print  them  by loading them into a separate utility such as Directory Opus and
printing them from there.
The  articles  in this issue are stored in a directory called @3data@1 on the disk.
Any  article  with  a  filename  extension of @7.txt@1 is an ASCII text article and
articles with extensions of @7.iff@1 are IFF graphics files.
For example the article you are reading at the moment is called:
@7
                Printing.txt
@1
This means that it is an ASCII text file.

We  may  include  a printing function in future issues of Beyond Sanit-E but we
don't think that it is an essential feature at the moment.

NOTE:  You will have to manually remove all the colour codes (@?) from the text
       files before printing them.  SORRY!@1
