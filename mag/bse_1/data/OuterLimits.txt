@3After  the  first  season  of the X-Files was concluded, BBC 2 was lacking some
decent  science-fiction  stuff.   To  solve  this problem, "the powers that be"
decided  upon  The  Outer  Limits  to perform the mammoth task of replacing the
infamous files.

The Outer Limits is apparantly based upon a 1960's series of the same name, and
is  basically  a 90's remake.  Unlike the X-Files, episodes of The Outer Limits
are  not connected with each other in any way and each has different characters
and subjects for each programme.

The  episodes  (which, incidently, do not rival the X-Files in any way) vary in
quality  and,  although  the  special  effects  are  excellant thoroughout, the
storylines  are  a  bit lame sometimes.  The writers have taken inspiration for
the  plots  from  a  lot  of  existing sci-fi material.  For example, the pilot
episode  called Sandkings has elements of the movie Arachnophobia within it and
Virtual Future could be vaguely linked to The Lawnmower Man.

You'll  even see some famous faces from the world of science fiction in some of
the  programmes.   These  include  Michael  Dorn,  whose famous as Worf in Star
Trek-The Next Generation and Leonard Nimroy who we all know as the Vulcan Spock
from the original Star Trek.

Overall, it's a mixed series with some well-written, imaginative storylines and
a  few  bad  ones inbetween.  So, if you decide to watch The Outer Limits, make
sure  that you watch a few of the programmes before you make up your mind about
the whole series.

@5The  Outer  Limits  is  currently being broadcast on Tuesdays at around 9 pm on
BBC2.
