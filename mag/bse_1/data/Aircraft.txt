@7THE STEALTH
@1Most  aircraft  are  breathtaking but the Stealth is a lot more then then that.
The  Stealth  is based in United States Air Force.  The Stealth's Nicknames are
Nighthawk,  Wobblin Gobblin, F-117A and Stealth Fighter.  The F-117A is made up
of  lots  of other parts of Aircraft.  The undercarriage came from the Northrop
F-5  and  the  fly  by  wire  system from the F-16 Fighting Falcon.  It`s first
flight was on the 18th of June 1981.


@7THE VULCAN
@1The  Vulcan  has  4  Rolls Royce engines for lots of force.  The first type 698
prototype (VX770) came to a tragic end on September 20th, 1958 during a flypast
at Syerston when the airframe literally broke up (right).  In that accident the
whole  of  the  right  wing exploded.  The reason it exploded is because of the
speed that it was going.  The Vulcan is always popular with crowds.
