  Grandson:  Grandad, can I earn some pocket money?
  Grandad:   Yes, if you put all those worms that are on the grass back 
             into the holes they came out off, I will give you a pound.
  Grandson:  Oh, thank you Grandad.

    @3  10 PM - THE GRANDSON COMES INSIDE@1

  Grandson:  Grandad! Grandad! I've done it! Can I have my pound now?
  Grandad:   I don't believe it! how did you do it?
  Grandson:  I made this solution that made the worms stick up straight 
             and hard.
  Grandad:   Can I borrow some?
  Grandson:  Yes Grandad.
  Grandad:   Brilliant! I'm off to bed, say goodnight to your Grandma.

  @3    NEXT DAY - AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE@1

  Grandad:   Here's another pound coin.
  Granson:   What for?
  Grandad:   It's from Grandma, she said it stayed up for long time.
