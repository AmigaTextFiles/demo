@5  This  is  a feature we will include in our next volume, out around October
November  1995.   If  the  response is good enough, it will include work by me
(Gobliiin) and just about anyone wanting to submit work of a good to excellent
standard.   Pictures  must be original and can be produced in any screen mode,
including  HAM  (Except  AGA.   We  want  everyone to see your work).  Also NO
scanned  images,  because  there's  no  real skill in that, is there?  That is
unless  it  has  major  re-work  done  to  it,  Images can be drawn in any IFF
supporting package and must be signed and dated (We don't want someone nicking
your picture and calling it there own, do we?).

@4   Send   the   completed   artwork  to  either  of  the  addresses  in  the
@3CONTRIBUTIONS@4 or @3CONTACT US!@4 articles.
