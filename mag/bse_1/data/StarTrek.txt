   Whether  you're  a  trekkie  (passing interest), or a trekker (fully fledged
Star  Trek  maniac)  this  file  is  for you.  From Captain Christopher Pike to
Captain  Jean-luc  Picard.   From  Enterprize  NCC-1701  to Voyager.  (I`ve got
nothing  at all on Star Trek-Voyager so any information you could send me would
be  much  appreciated, and maybe even payed for if its worth it.) Your comments
on any of the series:  Star Trek The Original Series (TOS), The Next Generation
(TNG),  Deep Space Nine (DS9) and Star Trek-Voyager (STV) would be appreciated.
To  help  you on your way I have found a few Internet sites regarding Star Trek
in a magazine I bought a few weeks back, so here they are:  @3



@4                              Voyager Home Pages:

@5                     >>  http://voyager.paramount.com/  <<

@3Information on Star Trek:Voyager, strangely enough, and by the way its based at
Paramount Studios in the States.

@4                           Asimov`s Star Trek Pages:

@5             >>  http://www.inlink.com/~asimov/trek-menu.html  <<

@3Information on Star Trek:  The Original series, The Next Generation, Deep Space
Nine and Voyager.



@4                       Luca Sambucci`s Star Trek Pages:

@5     >>  http://www-iwi.unisg.ch/~sambucci/scifi/startrek/st-www.html  <<

@3Huge guide to all Star Trek related information on the net and much, much more.



@4                      British Starfleet Confederation:  

@5                >>  http://deepthought.armory.com:80/~bsc/  <<

@3This one, as the name may of hinted, is the official on-line British fan club.

@4                            Klingon Assault Group: 

@5                   >>  http:www.iac.net/~twisty/kag.html  <<

@3The title says it all (it is a non profit making group so I am told).



@4                     Nightmare Factory Star Trek Costumes:

@5                 >>  http://www.io.com/~nightime/trek.html  <<

@3As  above,  this  one  is  pretty  self explanatory.  If you want anything from
replica  shirts  to  communicator  pins, then this is the one for you (eat your
heart out QVC).@1

And how about some addresses for you non-modem owning people:

            @5           Star Trek: The Official Fan Club
                      PO Box 355, Bushey, Watford WD2 2NA

@1Just  one more thing before I leave you, if you want anything Star Trek related
or  want  to  get  rid of anything Star Trek related, you can advertise free in
this magazine.  Just read the ADVERTS article to see how to do this.
