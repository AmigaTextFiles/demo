@1(1)  Never  rest your elbows on the table.  Place them neatly in the dinners of
     the persons on either side of you.  If they object, place your fist neatly
     in their gobs.

(2)  Never ask if you may leave the table, take it with you.

(3)  If  your  neighbour  chokes  over  his food, leave him.  If he chokes over
     yours, twat him in the face.

(4)  A spoon is provided for the sole purpose of flicking food.  a knife is for
     clearing  ear  wax,  bum bluff and, if you have a big bloody nose, you can
     pick some snot.

(5)  When prayers are been said, it is the best time to get your arse under the
     table and get looking up those skirts you dirty bugger!
