THE NEW 'A1200xl', DUE AUGUST IS AN EXCITING AND MUCH NEEDED DEVELOPMENT IN THE
AMIGA MARKET.

                                  @2Two Models@1

The  two models of the 'xl' as it's known to its close friends, boasts the full
monty  Motorola  68030 set (MMU+Cache+FPU) running at 33 and 50MHz respectively
with  upto  64  Megabytes  of memory and a CHOICE of two hard drive interfaces;
ATA-IDE-wide  (New  High-performance  IDE)  and  SCSI-2wide, the 50MHz model is
twice as powerful as the A4000-030!

@2Boost for Lightwave users@1

Even  the  33MHz  model  is  33%  faster  than  the  A4000-030 which is a great
improvement  over  the  basic  A1200.  The addition of a maths co-pro will be a
massive  boost  for  Lightwave  users,  enabling rendering to be done in only a
fraction of the time it usually takes.

@2Dual HD interfaces@1

The two hard drive interfaces is a brilliant surprise giving you the freedom of
ATA-IDE-wide  and  SCSI-2-wide,  both  have extremely high performance transfer
rates (see tech specs above).
