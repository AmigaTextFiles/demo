What's  this?   A  new  Magnum-produced  diskmag  made  in Lincolnshire (sounds
familiar!).

This  one's  made by a PD library (V12-PD to be precise) and is given away free
on the second of their July'95 catalogue disks.

I  can't  really comment that much on this first issue because it has been made
in  a  rush  to  fit on the catalogue disks.  As for the presentation, there is
only  so much you can do to configure the Magnum program to your own needs and,
unfortunately,  this  means  that  all  the magazines created with it look very
similar  to each other.  Like many disk magazines, Careless Whispers is written
in  a  humourous  style  and  balanced  with the odd serious article.  (It also
explains why we keep seeing all these traumatised PARROTS around !?!?!)

Personally,  I'm  waiting  for  the  second  issue to see what the full version
actually turns out like.
