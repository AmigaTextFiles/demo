@3Ever  since  the Amiga went out of production the market for Amiga products has
been  constantly decaying.  The first sign of this was the retreat of companies
such  as  Gremlin  and  Sensible  Software  from  the Amiga platform.  And now,
another  blow  has  been  dealt  to machine that's already lying on the canvas,
coughing up blood!

THE  ONE  magazine,  published  by EMAP Images, has ended publication with it's
August  issue.   EMAP have said that it has been 'temporarily suspended' due to
the  current  condition  of  the  Amiga games industry.  Another reason from an
alternative  source  states  that  it  was  stopped due to a lack of sufficient
revenue from advertising.

Fortunately,  THE ONE is still reaching out from the verge of death in the form
of  a  mini  co-operation  with EMAP's surviving Amiga mag:  CU AMIGA.  This is
being  achieved  by  the  use  of  regular  contributions  from  Matt Broughton
(ex-deputy  editior  for  THE ONE) in the magazine.  So, it seems the future of
THE  ONE,  like  the Amiga itself, seems uncertain and I, for one, hope it will
return to it's rightful place on the newsagent's shelf as soon as possible.

Again,  this reinforces the arguement that the sooner ESCOM gets the Amiga back
into the shops, the sooner the industry can recover.
