@3   Probably  one  of  the biggest growing hobbies in the UK.  I personally only
have  about  40  different  ones  but  have not been to the pub for a couple of
months,  so  I  have probably missed some new ones.  But why collect beer mats,
well  it  gives  you a bloody good excuse to go down to the local for a pint or
four (not that most people need an excuse), and as I have said before, loads of
people  are  doing  it  (collecting  beer  mats  that is).  So anyone with some
interesting  or  rare  mats  get in contact or send me a spare if you have one.
Also if anyone has got the one with the little guy from the Skol advert on (the
one where you can put your fingers through his legs), please could you send it.
I  have  been  after  it  for  ages (please do not bend it if at all possible).
Thanks!
   Also  I  have  noticed a great number of people are starting to collect rave
flyers as the art on them is usually of an excellant standard.  I would also be
grateful  if  you  could  send  any  new ones as I don't get into the city very
often,  so  they  would  be most appreciated.  If they are any good the postage
will be refunded as with the beer mats.  Thanks and hear from you soon...
