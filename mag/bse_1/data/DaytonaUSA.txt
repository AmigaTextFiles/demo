       @5          A GUIDE TO THE ARCADE VERSION OF DAYTONA USA

@1Now,  if  you  are  like  me  and  love  the thought of kicking the crap out of
somebody's car, then this is the game for you.

When  I  go to the arcades to scope out the latest machines I tend to play in a
certain way.  This includes shouting out phrases that rhyme with muddy funster,
trashing  opposing  players cars and hurling lots of abuse around the arcade on
unsuspecting members of the public, you just can't beat it.

Daytona for me, is belting round an oblong track oblitorating the cars as I go.
But for you (I.E.  Nite) you yell at the first sign of any unfair play (You can
release  the  neckhold now, Nite!), which is usually to no avail because you're
already  upside  down  in  the wall (HA HA HA HA HA).  @3[Oh No!  I can see a war
starting here.  zYLAX!]@1
 
But now for your guide as promised.

The  first  thing to do is learn how to use the gears, they aren't hard at all,
but  it  does  take  practise  to  get  it  exactly  right.   Second, learn the
Powerslide  because  this is the only way you will ever finish the Expert Level
Track,  which is bloody hard.  The way to do it is, brake before the corner and
turn  the  wheel, then floor the accelerator when you are are coming out of the
corner and belt off into the sunset.  (Er, got a bit carried away there)


@7Useful (?) tips for Daytona USA:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@5
 1.  Scream abuse at everyone driving against you.

 2.  On the Beginner track, remember that you start the race on a Rolling Start
     so,  put  the  gearstick  straight  into fourth instead of starting in the
     first gear.

 3.  If  you  are lucky enough to find a four player Daytona,  don't be sad and
     put  a  pound  coin in for a one player.  Wait for three other players and
     cause extreme violence!

 4.  If  all  else  fails,  and the person next to you is doing better (but you
     know  you  can  whup  em'  in a fight), then lean over to see how they are
     doing and do one of the following two things:

        A > Push the steering wheel to make them lose control.
        B > If opponent is on the right of you,  give he/she (no sexism here) a
            dead  leg  on  the left leg, causing their foot to slam hard on the
            brake.   @3[This  idea  originally  came  from  Gobliiin/PTK.   Yeah,
            everyone gets credited here!  zYLAX!  <-See!]@5

 5.  Push he/she in front of articulated lorry as revenge for beating you.
