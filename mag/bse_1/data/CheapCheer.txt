@5So those are the machine specs needed.  Not much, is it?  But is it worth going
out   and  buying?   Well.......YES!!!   One  of  the  most  excellent  graphic
adventures  I have ever had the pleasure to play.  The animation runs amazingly
smooth, even on a bog standard 1 meg A500.  The disk swapping is kept to a bare
minimum  (non  at all if you have a hard drive).  The graphics are very lush to
say  the least and fit the plot perfectly, but that's enough of that.  Whats it
all  about?  Well, the game is all about Conrad Hard, a man in the 21st century
(oooooh!)  who finds out that the earth and a few other planets, are being over
run  by aliens in the guise of humans (eeeeeer!  just like V).  Anyway, as soon
as  the  aliens  find  out that Conrad knows about them, they decide to ask him
nicely  to  forget (with a rudy great lazer gun thingymabob).  Anyway, to cut a
long story short, you have to control Conrad and help him to regain his memory,
so  he  can finally destroy all alien type scum off the face of the planet (and
their planet (and a few other planets)).  So if you haven't bought it yet, then
don`t waste any more time, go buy it now, you won`t regret it.@1

@5Machine specs above as before (and just about the same as before).  Is this one
worth  buying  as  well?   Well,  in not to many words, YES!!!  Why?  Well, I`m
going to tell you I am.  When this came out on the PC it was frigin' amazing to
put  not to fine a point on it.  See this running on an IBM PC 486 with a 800mb
hard  drive and a VGA graphics card (Yes, we get the point!), then you see what
an  amazing  game this is, especially when run on an A500.  You see how amazing
the  programmers  had  to  be  to  get so much information on such a low memory
machine ( 1meg is not a lot) considering most PCs have between 4 and 40 meg (ok
maybe  not  40)  at hand to run there programs (they need most of it to run the
vastly  inferior  Windows program (just remember it may only have 1 or 2meg but
it  is  still  the best machine in the world!!)), as above the disk swapping is
kept to a minimum and the graphics are dark and gloomy which adds to the effect
of a dark future scenario, but what is it all about, well its set in the not to
distant  future of business crime and corruption, you must work your way around
the  world, killing or persuading country leaders to join your worthwhile quest
for  world  domination,  you  control  upto 4 syndicate agants at a time with a
lethal  cocktail  of  armourment  from a pistol to a gause gun (personal rocket
launcher to you and me) to help you in your 30 or so missions.  So as before if
you haven't got it already, don't wait long to get it as I dont think that they
will be around for long.@1
