                         @5          X FILES

                   @3         THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE


 @5      "Do you know how hard it is to fake your own death?  Only one man
                    pulled it off - Elvis" - Fox Mulder,FBI

@1   The  FBI hold a series of files within their vaults that feature unexplained
phenomena.   Anything irrational or bizarre is contained within them.  Official
acknowledgement of their existence hasn`t been forthcoming, but two agents have
been assigned to continue investigations into these cases:

FOX  MULDER  Aged  35, nickname `Spooky`.  Educated at Oxford, where he wrote a
thesis  on the link between serial killers and the occult.  His sister Samantha
disappeared   in   mysterious   circumstances   in   1972   -  Mulder  believes
extraterrestrials were responsible for her abduction.

DR.    DANA   SCULLY  Aged  31,  nickname  `Starbuck`.   Educated  at  Maryland
University,  and  wrote  a thesis concerning a new interpretation of Einstein`s
twin paradox.  Attended medical school before joining the FBI two years ago.

Between  the  two of them they fight the higher levels of the FBI to allow them
to continue their work sifting out the truth about what is contained within The
X-Files...

   The X Files, arguably the best sci-fi programme the states have shipped over
for  a long time (probably with the exception of Star Trek The Next Generation)
and we will be opening our own files here in Beyond Sanit-E for you to air your
views  on  episodes,  experiences and information regarding anything strange or
just that one episode that gave you the willies for a few nights.  We will also
be giving information on X-File related stuff (addresses, dates, times etc) and
if  you  do  watch the series on Sky then don`t expect Mulder and Scully to get
involved because it would ruin the program all together (so there!!).

   I  have just watched the last episode of the second series and to put not to
fine  a  point  on it it was fucking excellent, but what a way to end a series.
Is he or isn't he and if not then where the hell is he?  "What the hell is this
mongrel  on  about?" I hear all you non-Sky owning people saying.  Well, if you
don`t  own  Sky  then I am truly sorry, but if you do then we only have about 6
months until series 3 rears its god damn "butiful" head onto our screens again.
Apparently  the new series is totally based on real FBI X-Files so we should be
in  for  a  real treat, but if you can't control yourself for that long I think
BBC 2 are screening series 2 in the not to distant future.


          @4                   The X Files Addresses@1

`FILED AWAY` desperately wants to hear your views, comments and opinions on any
episodes  or plots of The X-Files.  Also, any cast sightings and what it is you
like about The X-Files.  Filed Away will include a news section, episode guide,
information file and pen pal lists.  The first issue is (was!!!) intended to be
out  in  early April.  For a flyer containing details, send a SAE to Filed Away
c/o 14 Woodcock Street, Sandal, Wakefield, West Yorkshire WF1 5LG

Or, if you want to write to the official US fan club then write to:  The XFiles
Fan Club, PO Box 3138, Nashua, NH 03051 3138, USA.


                 @4              The X Files Info@1

The  series  was  inspired  by research revealing that 15 per cent of Americans
claim  to have seen or had contact with extraterrestrials, and up to 6 per cent
believe they`ve actually been abducted by alians.

Each episode is filmed in and around Vancouver, Canada, and costs upwards of $1
million  to  make.   Apart from the stars, the production team and cast are all
Canadian.

What  do  X-File  fans  want  more than anything?  For Mulder and Scully to get
themselves  a  love life - together.  `But why?` complains Anderson.  `It would
ruin the show.`

Duchovny  was  born  in  New  York,  graduated from Yale and dropped out of his
doctoral  programme in English Litriture to act off Broadway.  Current address:
Malibu.  Status:  single.

Anderson  worked in college and community theatre before dropping into New York
to  act  off  Broadway.   Current address:  Los Angeles.  Status:  married, one
child.

Mulder`s most cryptic line?  `Believe what you want to believe, Scully,` at the
end of the Lazarus episode in the first series.

A  beginner`s guide to basic X-Files jargon:  EBE - extraterrestrial biological
entity; DT - Deep Throat; the smoking man - nameless Pentagon bureaucrat.

So  that's  it  for this time PLEASE dont forget to get our next copy of Beyond
Sanit-E as there will be much more.
