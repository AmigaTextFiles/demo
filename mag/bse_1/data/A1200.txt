@4The latest news concerning the return of the Amiga from Amiga Technologies GmbH
(UK)  [The division of ESCOM handling the British market], is that the A1200 is
due  to  be retailing at either 350 or 399 pounds, which is a distinct increase
from it's previous selling price of 299 pounds.

Amiga Technologies GmbH (UK) justify this increase by saying that a lower price
would  be impossible in the UK.  They also say that the software, that is to be
packaged  with the A1200, of which only Scala MM300 is known at this time, will
make the price seem a more attractive proposition.

Considering the cost of a decent PC, this price may not seem that drastic.  But
seeing as ESCOM are already selling Pentium PC's at 800 pounds in the UK, makes
the new price of an A1200 seem a bit greedy on ESCOM's part!

One  obsticle  the  relaunch  of  the  Amiga will encounter is that of the Sony
Playstation.   If the Amiga is released at the time it is expected it will also
conflict  with  the  release  date  of  the  Playstation.   This  will make the
Playstation  a  direct  competitor  against  the  Amiga  and  the price of each
machine,  combined  with  the  package  bundled  with it, will become a serious
deciding factor for the potential customer.

Despite this, ESCOM are speculating that sales of the A1200 between the October
to  Christmas  period  will  reach 50,000 units and I, from personal knowledge,
think this is a very likely possiblility.
