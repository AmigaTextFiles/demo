@4Q:   Got  some  hardware that's out of date?  No longer of any use or the wrong
type for your machine?


Q:   Got  some old games, utilities that's no fun to play/use any more or don't
work on your new machine?


@3A:  Advertise in our new disk mag for anything computer related.  If you want a
new  computer,  new/old  game, hard to find utility, an Amiga penpal to contact
and  swap  with,  or  just to get rid of some old stuff.


@1Send  your  advert  on disk with ONE first class stamp (so we can send the disk
back to you, complete with the latest issue on).


@7Advert  requirements:@1
Your  advert must include your full name, address and phone number (if you have
one).   State  clearly  what  you want and PLEASE, for your own sake, make sure
that  all information involving money is legible.  (Also, bear in mind, that we
won't  be  checking  spelling on adverts, so use care when creating them!)

Text  adverts  must  be  in  ASCII  text  format  (I  think just about all word
processors support ASCII somewhere down the line) and can be no longer than ONE
page.

Graphic adverts must be in IFF format, NTSC in size, be LO-RES and have no more
than EIGHT colours (to conserve memory and disk space).


@5                      ALL ADVERTISING IS FREE OF CHARGE


@1Well  maybe  be lied a bit when we said free advertising coz we'll only let you
advertise  if  you  submit  an  article  to  us as well.  It doesn't have to be
massive  (a  page  will  do) or well written as long as the effort has been put
into  creating  it.   As long as we find your advert and article on the disk, I
can see no problem in your advert being added to our mag at a future date.

You  can only have ONE advert in each issue.  We think you will agree this is a
reasonable amount for anyone, and it gives us more space for other adverts, and
more importantly more articles.


@3IMPORTANT:   Please  note  that  PowerTeK as a whole (or any of it's individual
members)  take  no  responsibility  for the consequences of replies to adverts.
This,  basically,  means that if you answer an advert in Beyond Sanit-E and are
ripped  off,  it is not our fault and we can't do anything about it.  Although,
we  hope  we  can  trust  you  not  to  use  the  magazine as a marketplace for
con-artists.

            @1   Thanks for reading and hope to hear from you soon
