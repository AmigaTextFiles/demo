Do  you  want  fame, fortune and thousands of beautiful, naked girls licking...
(STOP!!).   If  you  do then you should immediately stop reading lame disk mags
like this and do something constructive such as turning to crime!  Of course if
you  are  satisfied  with  a  ordinary, law-abiding (well, maybe not completely
legal)  life  and  want  to  help  us  make  this  magazine  a  success then we
desperately need your contributions.

OK, still reading! Then this is what we what ya to give us:

ARTICLES
~~~~~~~~@1
We  need lots of articles for each issue and we can't write them all ourselves.
So  this  is  where  we  need  your  help.  Articles can be replies to previous
articles,  reviews, opinions, fiction, and anything else you can think of.  You
are  not  restricted  to using text only in the articles and we will accept IFF
files  for  graphics.  This means that you can send us comic strips or pictures
for  inclusion  into  the magazine.

Also  let me make it clear that we will not change any material that we receive
as  we  feel  very strongly against any form of censorship.  Of course we would
probably  choose  not  to include hard core porno stuff in the mag, coz I don't
really  want  to visit my local police station and try to convince someone that
the  sheep  in  the WOOLLY THRILLS IFF article was being shagged in an artistic
manner!  (Besides if you want stuff like that you'll probably know where to get
it.)

We would like articles in the following file formats:
@4
            ASCII text - This can be created in any text editor (such as
                         Cygnus Ed, Edge, MeMACS, Ed) and a variety of
                         word processors.
                         Please don't add formatting codes, use tabs or
                         add colours to the text because it makes editing
                         it a lot more difficult.

            IFF files  - These can be created in virtually every Amiga
                         paint program (for example Deluxe Paint or Personal
                         Paint).
                         Also take note of the following rules:
                            NTSC size  -  Make sure your GFX are NTSC in
                                          size or they won't fit on the
                                          page.
                            No AGA!    -  At this point in time we are
                                          aiming to make this magazine
                                          compatable with all Amigas so
                                          we are disallowing the use of
                                          AGA screen modes which can only
                                          be used by A1200 and A4000 users.
                         Apart from that you are free to use any screen
                         modes you like including Interlace, HAM, Low, Med
                         and High resolution.

             Paper     - You can use this in conjunction with a writing
                         implement (such as a pen or pencil) to create text
                         articles.

MUZIK MODULES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~@1
You  may  have  noticed  that the muzik in this issue is a module that I ripped
from  a  demo.   I am not proud of this and think it's a very lame thing to do,
but we have no musicians and therefore not much choice.

This is, again, where we need your help.  If you have created a module and want
it to be used in a future issue of Beyond Sanit-E, don't hesitate to send it to
us coz we're desperate for soundtracks!!

The  only  rulez  that  we  give  ya  here  is that try to keep the module to a
reasonable  size  (no more than 350K uncrunched).  If it is a format other than
Sound/Pro Tracker or MED/Octamed, please include the program you used to create
it with (or a suitable mod player) on the disk.
