@4   What  I want to know is, did Terry Pratchett actually know what he was doing
when  he created this masterpiece of modern humourous writing?  Can anyone just
come  up  with Granny Weatherwax, Gaspode, Carrot, Brutha, the librarian (ook!)
and,  of  course, Cut Me Own Throat Dibbler?  (No Discworld novel with the word
Ankh-Morpork  in  it  is  complete  without  the words C M O T Dibbler)) I have
currently  read  Mort,  Wyrd  Sisters, Pyramids, Guards!  Guards!, Men at Arms,
Moving  Pictures,  Reaper Man, Small Gods and Lords and Ladies and have enjoyed
them  all.   I  am  just itching to see if he releases Rincewind (the Discworld
computer  game)  on  our  glorious  computer  on  3.5  disk  or Compact Disk, I
personally  would buy a CD ROM drive just for that.  If anyone would like to do
a review on any of the TERRY PRATCHETT novels then we would be happy to include
them  in  our next BS release (especially reviews of his latest releases).  Any
drawings of carictures will also almost definately be included in future issues
as long as they are of a good to excellent standard.  But that's it for now, as
the  most excellent Mr Pratchett writes in most of his books.  "TERRY PRATCHETT
WAS BORN IN 1948 AND IS STILL NOT DEAD!" Thank you...
