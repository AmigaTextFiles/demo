@4The  first  thing  that strikes you about Ridge Racer is the fact that it is so
damn  fast.   The moment you hit the first corner you feel a compulsion to find
that  little  bastard  in  the  yellow  car,  who  is  the  fastest in the game
incidentally.

The  whole  game  of Ridge Racer is set on just one track but it has two routes
depending on your skill (or lack of it).


Here are some things to do whilst playing:

@3   1. Scream abuse at everyone driving with you.
   2. Use the Clutch as the Brake.
   3. When in Manual, always keep in 6th gear round corners to break lap
      record.
   4. Put your hand on the top of wheel to gain most control.
   5. Choose Music number 2 (Grid) for the best fast driving effect.
   6. Never ever begin on anything higher than Intermediate Level.
   7. Play Daytona coz this is too easy.
