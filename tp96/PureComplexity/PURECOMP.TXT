                          Class : 40kb intro

                        Version : Compotition Version

                      ------------------------------



                               Information:

This 40kb intro requires some fastmem (4 megs should be enough) AND a FPU!
It has been tested to work succesfully on a 030/50/50, but it MIGHT work on
less powerfull machines - although this is NOT recommended! This compo
version does, as far as we know, NOT work on 040 based Amigas! Somehow it
works partially on 060 based Amigas, but we think the FPU code have some-
thing to do with this. BUT... A non-FPU version with improved objects,
textures AND ofcourse working on both 040 and 060, WILL be released in the
near future. But deadline is closing in on us, so this is all you get now.
