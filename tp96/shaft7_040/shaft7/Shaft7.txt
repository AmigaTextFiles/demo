                        First Place at THE PARTY 6


1. ABOUT REVISION :

   Well, after some holydays, this is our official 68040/60 fix. this 
   version was developed on a 68040 at 40 Mhz, we have not tested the demo
   on normal A4000 nor 68060 but we expect it to work...

   Also, the very original module has now replaced the one used in the old
   version (thank you Yolk!!!)

   And finally, we have crunched some parts and the demo takes less space on
   your HD so everybody should download this new version.

2. HOW TO WATCH THE DEMO :

   Just copy the files from the archives to a directory ; 
   and execute : SHAFT7.EXE

3. SOME STATEMENTS :

	- Sorry for a so long release, but we were not able to test it on
	  a real 040. We finally got one (at Axel work) and made it.

	- all effects are 1x1 so you shouldn't ask yourself if they are
	  in 1x2 or 2x2. Also no mirror cheating needed...

	- Watch them Dogs.

	- We would like to send our respects to Azure/Artwork, Murk/sonic
	  and to Destop/Cncd for keeping so high our pleasure when watching
	  their productions...  Keep doin' what you're doin'

	- Greetings to : Orcus, Spock, Calisto, Dyze, Uz, Darky, Snag, Kimba
			 Xann, Goyan, Ace, Zeugma, Gryzor, Gengis, Oxbab, Seb,
			 Spiral, Niko, Mon, Ninja, Hof, Reflex, Nam, Alex,
			 Jumbo Burger, AudioMonster, Dune, Mr Vatin, Zeb, Benj, 
			 Hardfire, Haplo, Gelmir, Yolk & legend, Lca, Zappy,  
			 Patapom, Rez, and everybody at the party

	- A very special thank must go to : Zack/Giant, Sixpack/Gods and
          Scanx/Emergency for supplying us their tv cable at the party place
          bcoz without you, it would not have been possible... 

	- To the Party Organizers : Where the fuck were the showers...

	- Beware of Dogs.


4. DEMO REQUIREMENTS :

   This demo should work on basical A1200+4Mb fast mem and a HD, but you
   should run it from a 030 at 40 MHz (or better) with 8Mb and a -FAST-
   HD... Otherwise you will have some synchronization problems, and so on.
   Sorry to all those who haven't such systems, but rules at the Party were
   quite cool !! Finally, you shouldn't run it an Overdrive...
   I (Ben) included at last minute a little demo rescuer. When the demo suxx,
   it should give you back a clean memory... It should...
