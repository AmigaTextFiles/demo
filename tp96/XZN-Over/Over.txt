Uff... it's finished. "Over" is X-ZoNe's contribution to The Party 6. It was
coded only in 6 hours of hard work during 25th of December 1996, so don't
expect the best routines in the world. It features Only environment + bump.

Special thanks and greetings are to Randy/RJ, Darkman/RJ and to Duke/TPD. =D
