DataWorld II
------------

an animation show by Infect and WK-Artworks.

This is our contribution to the WiLD COMPETITION at The Party 96.


Requirements
------------

 -AGA, MC68020, OS V39, 4 MB FastRAM
 -recommended: MC68030 @ 50MHz (or faster processor), 8 MB FastRAM


Running the show
----------------

We included several script files:
 -the '8MB' scripts use larger load buffers (for smoother playing)
 -anims with text are also available without ('txt' and 'notxt' scripts)

There are some keys you can press while playing:
 ESC, LMB - exit
 N - next animation
 SPACE - pause/continue
 S - sleep
 F1...F10 - set speed

It is of course possible to play single anims using the YAFA player 'YP'.
Use 'yp -h' for the list of options and read the documentation.
