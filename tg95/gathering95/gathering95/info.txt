  Gathering 1995 is a follow-up to the very successful conferences
  which have been held each eastern since 1992. This year, a organization
  called 'Gathering' consisting of members from Spaceballs, Scoop
  and Safe Hex Int. will be the arrangers.
                  The date for this conference will be

                       11th - 15th of April 1995
  The location is Stavanger Idrettshall, which is located 3-4 km outside
  Stavanger centrum, on the west-coast of Norway.
  The general concept will be somewhat like the previous conferences,
  but we expect more people, more computers, more software+hardware,
  and just about more of everything. - Except : fire-drills!

        Here is some useful information about the party-buildings:
                           M a i n  H a l l :
                            "Idrettshallen"

                  Area: 6000 Square meters divided into:
                        4000 square meters - Main party area!
                        2000 square meters - Cafeteria, Cinema,
                                             Stands, Toilets,
                                             showers & warderobes
                      S l e e p i n g  H a l l s :
                            "Tennishallen(e)"

There will be one or two seperate sleeping-halls. Both of them are right next
door to the main hall. The size of each hall is 4 fullsize tennis-courts.
                             C a t e r i n g :

The food and catering will probably be organized by the local McDonalds or
Dolly Dimple's. More accurate information will follow in later info-files.
We will also try to have "normal" food aswell, like milk and bread.

        N o   k i t c h e n   a p p l i a n c e s ,   p l e a s e !

For obvious reasons you will not be allowed to plug any electrical kitchen
appliances you might bring, to the ordinary electrical system. A freezer pull
enough power to feed around 5 computers, and a microwave pulls more than 10. 
Also, a freezer and a microwave both generate nasty electrical surges on the net
which might blow your computer hardware. A small number of people will however
be allowed to use their freezers, microwaves and ovens on a special circuit set
aside for this - and only for this - again on a first-come-first-served basis.

                          Before you arrive

In the invitation-leaflet, there will be a filled out postgiro-paper.
This should be filled out atleast a week BEFORE you arrive, so that
we can confirm your payment.

Please state CLEARLY your full name and handle on the postgiro.

We will also make maps in different picture-formats to make it easier for
car/bus drivers to locate the party-place. There will also be a road-map in 
the information-leaflet.

                           When you arrive

At the entrance, there will be a information desk where you can pay the
entrance-fee, or/and get your personal vote-disk. This disk will contain
a small voting-program, for either Amiga or PC, and we advice you to fill
in your votes after each competition has ended. 

You will also be given a badge not unlike the one used at The Party IV
in Denmark. This badge will show that you have payed.

You will be asked to enter a list of all equipment you bring into the hall.
This is for security reasons. Feel free to make this list in advance.

The doors will be opened 00:00 Monday night/Tuesday morning.
                       The entrance prices will be:
             Full entrance fee.: 250 NOK if payed on entry
                                 200 NOK if payed in advance
             Visitors..........:  75 NOK for one day
             Girls.............: FREE!
                      While you party (Part 1)

While you run around having the best time of your life, dozens of slaves
will be punching all your names into a humongous database. This is done
to keep track of the people. So that you can come to the information desk
later and search for a person and easily find out if he/she is available.

                      While you party (Part 2)

There will be a big monitor constantly running a slide show with
information. This will at all times show the number of people who have
registered. Also monitors will be placed around in the hall showing info
about the competitions etc.

                       Rules to obey while partying

     * Alcohol, illegal drugs and/or intoxicated people will not
       be allowed anywhere in the complex.

     * All kinds of Weapons and fireworks are ofcourse not allowed.

     * The organizers will not take responsibility for
       illegal swapping or software-piracy, nor for
       stolen properties.

     * If you destroy anything in the complex, you will be the one held
       echonimically responsible.
                            Time to vote

Just boot your votedisk, and fill in your answers. Then hand in the disk at
the information-desk. Here we'll register your votes into a enormous database
which will count and display the results afterwards.

         There will ofcourse be a party BBS at The Gathering 1995.

This year Big Blue BBS will stand for the show. They will set up about
20 Pentiums machines, giving us a total of 100-250 nodes and a
24h 128kb ISDN-line connected to the global InterNet. There will also
be plenty of network connection boxes placed around in the main hall.
If we manage to get one in time, there will be a Manhattan Computer
with 16 Pentium CPU's to serve the BBS.
  * We cannot prevent any other groups from setting up party BBSes
    but remember that if such should be set up, they will not be
    located at the party place and would therefor not have the
    desired effect. Also, Spaceballs and Scoop wishes to have
    NO RESPONSABILITY WHAT SO EVER of such systems!

        Since there has been so many suggestions for competitions,
        the thing we've settled for is that YOU arrange the competition
        yourself!

        We'll help you as best we can with the equipment and space. Also,
        if there's a 'final' in your competition, you can run it over
        the big screen and possibly over the sound system.

        Get together with a couple of friends and arrange your VERY
        OWN competition!

  Some of you who attended The Gathering 1994 party complained that
  the sound was quite bass'n'noisy.

  This time we will let a local disco set up all the audio-equipment,
  and professional sound-technicians will ensure a perfect sound to everyone
  in the hall during the main competitions and so on.  Also musicians will
  test and adjust the sound before and while the party is being held. 

  The sound will be played through a 25.000 watt soundsystem for optimum
  quality and pleasure.

  The sound system will NOT play background music, but we might use a day to
  get the best sound for everyone in the hall.

  If you want music while you work, we suggest that you bring your own
  portable stereo that won't ruin the sleep for 2000 people.

  The sound system will be used for messages during the party. Such
  messages can be handed over to the Information Desk, should you
  have something to say to everyone.
