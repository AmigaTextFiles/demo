				   NOTES:

Like last years, I decided to enter the 40kb compo of this party. It's a
tradition that everything goes wrong few days before the party: The coder that
was supposed to do it told me he was busy, so I started coding this intro 3
days ago. Muffler was supposed to compose a module but my provider deleted the
email, Ghandy sent a short poem for the beginning but the email went lost too,
Washburn didn't created the 3d scene, so I had to use an old one with a six
months old version of the engine. We hadn't any graphician, so I created all
the texts and palettes. What to say more? The module used was a nice one by
Racoon, but I wasn't able to contact him to ask the permission to use it.. I
hope you won't be angry, Lucas :) I decided to release it just for the fun of
it! I hope your eyes will be not disgusted...

Another note... Merry Christmas and a happy new year! ;)
