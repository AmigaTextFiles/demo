This is a fixed version of the 40kb intro "Headcase" which came
2nd at The Party 5 in Denmark, back in December 1995.

Changes for V1.1:
-----------------
- Proper lightsourcing at the envmap part.
- Removal of annoying flicker bug at the endpart which occured on
  some fast machines.
- Endpart is now approx. 10% faster.
- Better OS handling using a newer version of DemOS(tm).
