INSTALLING SPACEMAN BY RAM JAM

Installing Spaceman on your Hard Drive is very easy since Spaceman will
work ONLY on HARD DISK.
Just decompress the 2 LHA files in the same directory (feel free to choose
a dirname that suits to you...) and run SPACEMAN.

It doesn't need any Assign or anything else.

Requirements:
At least 68020
At least Aga Chipset
At least 2 Megs of ChipRam

Spaceman will work better with an accelerator card like Blizzard 1220 or
1230, but works quite in the same way also on a standard A1200.

It works also on all A4000 both 030 and 040. We didn't test it on a 060
since we don't have any, but we think it'd run ok on them too.


Enjoy Spaceman.
