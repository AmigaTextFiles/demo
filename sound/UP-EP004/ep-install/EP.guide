@{bg shine} introdukktion@{bg back}


 see... we were kinda bored by our current group, three little elks, so
 me (@{b}spot@{ub}) together with @{b}blade@{ub}, @{b}plus8@{ub} and @{b}skope@{ub}, made @{b}up@{ub} our cloudy minds
 and formed this fly crew "@{b}up rough soundsystem@{ub}".
 the idea was to kinda play it kool and release @{i}lotsa@{ui} moosik.
 most coders are so lazy nowadays anyway (Nem: "Ouch...that hurts" ;), so
 tryin' to kick as a demokru just ain't fun enuff.

-so whas'nu'bout that? there's already loadsa kru's doin' just that!

-yea... is it?

 see, they just release lame @{i}lha-lzx-zip-rar-arj-suckdick-whatever@{ui} packs.
 most of the kru's are also movin' towards the hitech bitch scene,
 releasin' cd's and mp3's and pc-shit n'n'and...  stuff! @{b}fuck them!@{ub}

 @{b}let's get real@{ub} and bring that feelin' back!

                                                                      /@{i}spot@{ui}

 installation@{bg back}

 @{u}install script@{uu}

 you @{b}should@{ub} use the installer! 

 @{u}manual@{uu}

 you should @{b}always@{ub} use the install script to install/update the @{b}ep@{ub}
 main filez and to copy new @{b}ep's@{ub} to ya drive. but if the
 install script doesn't work for some reason...here's how to do it
 yaself...

 1. make a dir called uprough (or somethang) somewhere on ya drive.

    (skip if u have a previous installation...)

 2. copy the files ep, ep.guide, eplogo.up, eplogopal.up,
    prefs, prefsmui and start to the directory.

    (@{b}important@{ub}: if ya got a previous installation, check the
    version of ep, ep.guide, prefs, prefsmui and start before ya copy 'em.
    @{b}always@{ub} use the @{b}latest version@{ub} of these files!)

 3. copy the icons ya wanna use from the icons/ directory.

 4. copy the ep:s ya wanna install from the eps/ directory.

 5. if ya want you can add the lines:

    ;begin ep
    assign ep: "<the directory u chose in 1.>"
    ;end   ep

    to your user-startup. but they @{b}ain't@{ub} needed if ya use the
    scripts to start da ep's.

 6. done!

@{bg shine}      the executable@{bg back}


  da ep executable chills with da followin' arguments:

  ?           display a help text.
  prefswin    open da prefs window.
  mui         use @{b}mui@{ub} for le sweet prefs window. if ya don't use the scripts,
              make sure the stack got a cool value.... at least > 4096.
              if ya use the scripts ya don't have to worry 'bout that stack shit.
              so... use da script's... damn!




@{bg shine}          da scripts@{bg back}


  start:      used to start ep. accepts same arguments as the ep
              executable but instead of "?" help is used. this script takes
              care of the ep: assign, stack etc etc...thats why ya really should
              use it.

  prefs:      prefs opens the prefs window (same as doin' start prefswin).

  prefsmui:   prefs opens the mui prefs window (start prefswin mui).


  note:       you can use all da scripts without execute because the s flag
              is set.  (if it isn't, do: protect <scriptfile> +s)
              but why start em from cli?

              use the nice icons and start 'em from ya pimpbench...




@{bg shine}    the prefs window@{bg back}


  screenmode: opens a screenmode requester that let's ya chose screenmode to
              run in.

  ep dir:     select directory where the ep ya wanna have a look at this time
              resides.

  dragsymbm:  drag method for the symbol.

  cpudraw:    use the cpu for drawing routines. on cgx this means direct cgx
              and for aga this is not added yet.

  winmode:    run in a window on the workbench. yuh must run da wb on a cgx
              screen with a depth > 8 and a size > 640x480.

  crossfade:  crossfades da paper doll when a part is exchanged. this requires
              a truecolour screen.

  fademodule: fades out modules.
   
  showintro:  show the ep intro?

  showeffect: show the effect?

  save:       save the current preferences to a prefs file.




@{bg shine}     the main window@{bg back}


  module gadgets: lmb, change the module.

  symbol gadgets: lmb, change the current symbol in the symbol box.

  symbol box:     lmb, drag the symbol with the mouse. release button to drop
                  da symbol.

  text box:       lmb, show next text part (wrap if last).
                  rmb, show previous text part (wrap if first)
                  if a wrap occurs and it is the welcome txt thats showing, then
                  da first module is started.

  f1-f10:         change the module.

  up arrow:       same as pressing rmb on txt box or if symbol currently is
                  beeing draged (not with the mouse), move the symbol up 8
                  pixels.

  down arrow:     same as pressing lmb on txt box or if symbol currently is
                  beeing draged (not with the mouse), move the symbol down 8
                  pixels.

  left arrow:     same as pressing the left symbol gadget or if symbol
                  currently is beeing draged (not with the mouse), move the
                  symbol left 8 pixels.

  right arrow:    same as pressing the right symbol gadget or if symbol
                  currently is beeing draged (not with the mouse), move the
                  symbol right 8 pixels.

  space:          same as pressing the symbol box but draging is made with
                  keyboard instead of mouse. or if symbol currently is beeing
                  draged, dropp it.

  s:              open a filerequester to save the module currently playing.

  q and esc:      quit

@{bg shine} questions@{bg back}



 B  when i press the "screenmode" gadget a error message appears saying
    somethang bout no modes available...whats the deal with that?

    ep simply couldn't find any screenmode(s) that was suitable to run on.
    (ie a screenmode with a size greater or equal to 640x480x6.)

    aga users: make sure that yuh have executed setpatch!



 B  why doesnt the screenmode requester show any cybergraphics modes when i
    boot without startup-sequence?

    because cybergraphics isn't running! copy envarc:cybergraphx to
    env:cybergraphx. and run ya monitor file from devs:monitors/.



 B  when i run the prefs window in mui mode a message appears saying
    "couldn't open muimaster.library v11+"...now what?

    make sure u've got mui version 3.0 or better (newest atm is 3.8). if u
    run withpout starup-sequence, make sure mui: is assigned to its proper
    place and that yuh've assigned "assign libs: mui:libs add".



 B  i think the doll flickers when it crossfades if i've got direct cgx on.

    well, this is because only 1/4 of the "crossfade cgx" is updated at a
    time. when no direct cgx is used, this is made in a buffer and when the
    4:th update is done the buffer is written to the screen. on direct cgx
    the gfx is written pixel for pixel when it's processed.



 B  seems like i ain't got enuff memory, what can i do to save some...?

    Cboot without startup-sequence.
    Cdisable all partitions not needed.
    Cdecrease the buffers for the partition(s) with addbuffers.
    Cdisable the effect and the intro.
    Crun in the lowest screenmode possible.
    Ccross ya fingaz.... and keep 'em that way untill it's all over!
