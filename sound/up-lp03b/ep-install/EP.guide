@{bg shine} introdukktion@{bg back}


 see... we were kinda bored by our current group, three little elks, so
 me (@{b}spot@{ub}) together with @{b}blade@{ub}, @{b}plus8@{ub} and @{b}skope@{ub}, made @{b}up@{ub} our cloudy minds
 and formed this fly crew "@{b}up rough soundsystem@{ub}".
 the idea was to kinda play it kool and release @{i}lotsa@{ui} moosik.
 most coders are so lazy nowadays anyway (nem: "ouch...that hurts" ;), so
 tryin' to kick as a demokru just ain't fun enuff.

-so whas'nu'bout that? there's already loadsa kru's doin' just that!

-yea... is it?

 see, they just release lame @{i}lha-lzx-zip-rar-arj-suckdick-whatever@{ui} packs.
 most of the kru's are also movin' towards the hitech bitch scene,
 releasin' cd's and mp3's and pc-shit n'n'and...  stuff! @{b}fuck them!@{ub}

 @{b}let's get real@{ub} and bring that feelin' back!

                                                                    /@{i}spot@{ui}

 @{u}manual@{uu}

 you should @{b}always@{ub} use the install script to install/update the @{b}ep@{ub}
 main filez and to copy new @{b}ep's@{ub} to ya drive. but if the
 install script doesn't work for some reason...here's how to do it
 yaself...

 @{fg shine}1@{fg text} make a dir called uprough (or somethang) somewhere on ya drive.

   (skip if u have a previous installation...)

 @{fg shine}2@{fg text} copy the files ep, ep.guide, eplogo.up, eplogopal.up,
   prefs, prefsmui and start to the directory.

   (@{b}important@{ub}: if ya got a previous installation, check the
   version of ep, ep.guide, prefs, prefsmui and start before ya copy 'em.
   @{b}always@{ub} use the @{b}latest version@{ub} of these files!)

 @{fg shine}3@{fg text} copy the icons ya wanna use from the icons/ directory.

 @{fg shine}4@{fg text} copy the ep:s ya wanna install from the eps/ directory.

 @{fg shine}5@{fg text} if ya want you can add the lines:

   ;begin ep
   assign ep: "<the directory u chose in 1.>"
   ;end   ep

   to your user-startup. but they @{b}ain't@{ub} needed if ya use the
   scripts to start da ep's.

 @{fg shine}6@{fg text} done!

  @{fg shine}prefs@{fg text}       prefs opens the prefs window (same as doin' start prefswin).

  @{fg shine}prefsmui@{fg text}    prefs opens the mui prefs window (start prefswin mui).


  @{fg shine}note@{fg text}        you can use all da scripts without execute because the s flag
              is set.  (if it isn't, do: protect <scriptfile> +s)
              but why start em from cli?

              use the nice icons and start 'em from ya pimpbench...

@{bg shine} questions@{bg back}



    @{fg shine}when i press the "screenmode" gadget a error message appears saying@{uu}
    somethang bout no modes available...whats the deal with that?@{fg text}

    ep simply couldn't find any screenmode(s) that was suitable to run on.
    (ie a screenmode with a size greater or equal to 640x480x6.)

    aga users: make sure that yuh have executed setpatch!

    @{fg shine}why doesnt the screenmode requester show any cybergraphics modes when i
    boot without startup-sequence?@{fg text}

    because cybergraphics isn't running! copy envarc:cybergraphx to
    env:cybergraphx. and run ya monitor file from devs:monitors/.

    @{fg shine}when i run the prefs window in mui mode a message appears saying
    "couldn't open muimaster.library v11+"...now what?@{fg text}

    make sure u've got mui version 3.0 or better (newest atm is 3.8). if u
    run withpout starup-sequence, make sure mui: is assigned to its proper
    place and that yuh've assigned "assign libs: mui:libs add".

    @{fg shine}i think the doll flickers when it crossfades if i've got direct cgx on.@{fg text}

    well, this is because only 1/4 of the "crossfade cgx" is updated at a
    time. when no direct cgx is used, this is made in a buffer and when the
    4:th update is done the buffer is written to the screen. on direct cgx
    the gfx is written pixel for pixel when it's processed.

    @{fg shine}seems like i ain't got enuff memory, what can i do to save some...?@{fg text}

    @{fg shine}c@{fg text} boot without startup-sequence.
    @{fg shine}c@{fg text} disable all partitions not needed.
    @{fg shine}c@{fg text} decrease the buffers for the partition(s) with addbuffers.
    @{fg shine}c@{fg text} disable the effect and the intro.
    @{fg shine}c@{fg text} run in the lowest screenmode possible.
    @{fg shine}c@{fg text} cross ya fingaz.... and keep 'em that way untill it's all over!

    @{fg shine}i can't get 'lowtech' ep going! it hangs while initializing the effect!@{fg text}

    you are runnig the ep under aga, and the effect requires quite a bit of
    chipmem! do the following to free as much memory as possible;

    @{fg shine}c@{fg text} boot without startup-sequence.
    @{fg shine}c@{fg text} disable all partitions not needed.
    @{fg shine}c@{fg text} decrease the buffers for the partition(s) with addbuffers.

    @{fg shine}c@{fg text} run in the lowest screenmode possible.
    @{fg shine}c@{fg text} cross ya fingaz.... and keep 'em that way untill it's all over!

    @{fg shine}what's all this shit about ep's, i thought this was supposed to be a single!?@{fg text}
   
    read the notes on the @{"singles" link "singles" 0}.

    @{fg shine}i found this weird bug, and it ain't mentioned here!@{fg text}

    tell us about it! try to be as accurate as possible, and don't
    forget to describe your amiga setup!

@{bg shine} notes on ahi - by substance@{bg back}



 @{fg shine}this text is taken from a note found in one of substances'
 mod archives. ahi is known to produce a distorted sound in some rare
 occasions, and this happened to me (spot) when i played automatic_gear
 by substance. therefor i decided to include this text in this guide,
 as it is valid for the ep's aswell.
 i hope you have no probs with this substance, all you want is that
 ya tunes sound right? no?@{fg text}


 @{u}how to play digiboosterpro's format (dbm) correct@{uu}

 the modules in the dbm directory are all in the digibooster's own
 native file format and there are some tricks which are needed to hear
 these songs like they were supposed to be. without taking care of
 these instructions, @{i}the tracks may sound completely wrong because it
 all depends on the settings of each ahi system.@{ui}

 the major difference between other module formats are probably the so
 called dsp effects, which allthough can also be emulated on machines
 without dsp soundcards. this is done by the ahi system which is the
 first demand before you can even use digiboosterpro. make sure you
 have it installed.

 when you have done so, open the @{b}ahi preferences@{ub} and select the best
 possible audiomode from the list. since most of these tracks are in
 16 bit it would be good if you'd have a soundcard. however, it's not
 necessary because even the @{b}14 bit paula modes@{ub} on ahi sound reasonably
 good. the only important thing here is to make sure you selected
 @{b}stereo ++ mode@{ub} because the dsp echo, volume and panning envelopes work
 only with the real stereo picture.

 now go to @{b}'advanced settings'@{ub} and make sure that the @{b}echo@{ub} is set on
 'enabled' to hear the realtime echo like it was planned. then accept
 these settings and start digiboosterpro, and if possible the latest
 available version (currently 2.21).

 sincerely yours, substance @{i}(www.amigascne.org/substance)@{ui}



 @{u}@{fg shine}note about the @{b}automatic gear single@{ub}@{uu}

 if you have followed substances' notes, and you still get a distorted
 output, then start the automatic gear single, and tap the "-" key some
 times, usually two or three times should be enough, and now you should
 have a perfectly clear output!!!@{fg text}

 @{i}@{fg shine}if ya already have an ep installed, read this;@{fg text}@{ui}

 the new up rough single series use the same code/replayer as
 the ep's. so, install it, and run it just as you do with
 the up rough ep's.
 then doubleclick on the "prefs" icon and select the new single, and click
 on the start button.

 @{i}@{fg shine}if ya don't have an ep installed, read this;@{fg text}@{ui}

 just ignore the word @{b}ep@{ub} and read @{b}single@{ub} instead, and you will understand
 everything!

@{bg shine}    getting started@{bg back}

  doubleclick on the @{b}prefs@{ub} icon.

  select a suitable screenmode by clicking on da @{b}screenmode@{ub} button.
  640x512 or 640x480 is the smallest accepted screenmode, but you are free to choose a higher
  resolution if ya like.

  choose the @{b}ep/single@{ub} you want to listen to, by clicking on the @{b}ep dir@{ub} button.
  a file requester should now pop up, displaying the ep's/singles you have installed.
  click on the ep/directory you have in mind, @{b}once.@{ub} now click on the @{b}ok@{ub} button.

  now click on the @{b}start@{ub} button, and the ep/single will load! @{i}really simple!@{ui}

  @{b}note:@{ub} if this is the first time you start the ep/single a screenmode-requester will
  pop up and ask you to chose a screenmode for the intro, chose 640x512/640x480, depending on 
  if you have a gfx-card or not.

  for a detailed description on all the buttons available in the prefs-window, 
  read the @{"usage" link "usage" 0} section of the guide.
