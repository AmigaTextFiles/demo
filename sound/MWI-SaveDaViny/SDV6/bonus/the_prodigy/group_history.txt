                      Prodigy History!

        The Prodigy story starts with a 12" EP called What Evil Lurks,
the  four  tracks of which were taken from the youthful Liam Howlett's
first   demo  tape.   The  EP  was  enthusistically  received  on  the
then-massive rave scene, and it remains a hardcore club anthem to this
day,  as  well  as  being one of the most sought after pieces of dance
vinyl  of  all time.  On the back of the EP's underground success, The
Prodigy  gigged  extensively  throughout the UK, and were able to make
their  first  trips [what sort?] abroad.  In Italy they were hailed as
pop royalty and mobbed by ecstatic ravers.

        On  August 12 1991, The Prodigy released their second single -
the  legendary  Charly.  There was a huge buzz around the track months
before its release, and that excitement was justified when Charly shot
to Number 1 in the National Dance Charts and to Number 3 in the Gallup
Top  40.  "Charly" inspired a string of copycat records, and triggered
the notoriously heated "Is Rave Dead?" debate.  Amid all the furore it
was  easy to miss the facty that Charly was one of the most successful
dance  records of the time, and far better than any of the opportunist
tunes that came in its wake.

        Twenty-two  year-old  Liam Howlett is the musical force behond
the  Prodigy  sound,  although  there  are  three  other  members  who
contribute  to  the live performance - Maxim Reality, Leeroy Thornhill
and  Keith  Flint.  Liam was once the DJ for the London rap act Cut To
Kill,  but  he  became  disillusioned  with the rap scene's aggressive
attitude  after experiencing the "Love, Peace and Happiness" vibe that
dominated the rave scene.

        Liam  is  also  a  classically trained pianist, whose ambition
once  was  "to  get a record deal and put out a few tunes".  That goal
was achieved very quickly, so Liam is now concentrating on maintaining
his  status  as the most successful hardcore underground act, blending
his  unique  sound  of  hip-hop beats and manic house music, and, most
importantly, keeping the crowds happy.

        Remember a few years ago?  Remember the raves with the pumping
bass,  the  volume  at  it's  best, the atmosphere kicking, the people
friendly  and  free!  But then the police had to put their oar in, the
government   then   have  their  say,  'turn  down  the  music,  noice
pollution'.   What a load of bollock's.  If you've been to the lastest
raves  then  you'll know the score.  What's going on?  You pay between
15-25  quid.queue up for about 45 minutes whilst having to put up with
the  old  bill  eyeing  you up and down as if you're some sort of mass
murder.And  once  you've  been  searched  and  had your shoes and sock
removed,  you  then  walk  into  the grounds to be met by thousants of
police  and  the  music at about 2db's, you might as well have brought
your  Walkman.  At every large rave lately the department of healt and
environment are there with their precious little toys called db.meters
making  sure  the  volume  doesn't  go  above  a  certain  level.  For
exemple,if  you  went  to univerce on 930813,resurrection on 930814 or
living  dream  930806 then you'll know what we mean.  All we can do is
apologise  to  you all for the very bad sound quality, but what can we
do?  You can't blame the promoters because they are doing an excellent
job  of  bringing  you  the best quality sound system (even though you
don't  get  to hear at it's best), excellent lighting,Dj's.  You can't
fault  them.If they did try to turn up the volume then the authorities
have two methods of getting them to turn it down-1.They can revoke the
licence  and  close  down the party and then ban any further events by
the offending organisation.2.Impose ridiculous fines which could be in
excess  of 25 000 pounds and revoke any future licences.  Now you know
why  these events are becoming more and more of an effort to go to,and
why they're so quiet when you do.  So there's no one left to blame but
the authorities.  Bollocks to the authorities.

        You  can't  stop  us,  we're gonna keep the dance scene strong
even if the world isn't.  This is your day and no one can take it away
from you.  The dance scene is to big to just disappear.

               Respect- Liam, Keith, Leeroy and Maxim.
