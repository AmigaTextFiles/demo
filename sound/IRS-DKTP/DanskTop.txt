                                 - DANSKTOP -
                               \-------------------/

This has been a long time in coming, but it is here now! A musicdisk
with Danish popular ballads and songs. All done expertly, so as to make
you puke, unless you actually like these kind of songs. It was released
on a saturday in October, more specifically the 17th October 1998.

Our thanks go out to Apollon and Cytron for giving us a tune each, thus
making the tasks easier for our own musicians. 

Take heed, this is the first time we officially use Talpa's system
startup, enabling multitasking, gfx card support and a lot of other
things, while greatly slowing down any computer, and making scrollers
slow down to a crawl on a 060 (but hey, it multitasks, hehe). You need
to have the RTG system installed, if you want to take advantage of your
gfx card for this production. Enjoy it :)

We are sorry for not releasing any production in September, seems as if
we have grown lazy, haha.. In the next months before TP8, there should
be a few things released though. And at TP8.. Who knows? But see you all
there, and let's try to smuggle in some beers here and there! :)
