The following files have been removed from this archive so i 
could upload to aminet..:

c/assign
c/Eighty
c/FadeType
c/Setpatch
libs/diskfont.library
libs/powerpacker.library

The files were only a bit important if you want to run digitalchips from 
disk, but most people these days have hd's (hIPPHURAAy) so it probably 
doesn't make any difference..  

spread'n enjoy!
