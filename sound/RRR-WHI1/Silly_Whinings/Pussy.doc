                    R.R.R. presents Silly Whinings


                  The Very Mother of All Music Disks

                         Released 21.Nov.94


 1. What da fuck?
 ----------------
 Couple of weeks ago there was a modulecompetition at our EastHKI
 HQ, Kevyt Linja (+358-0-343-2373) which was great success: Over
 15 modules took a part. Oh, the happiness, oh the rejoicement.

 Well, we kinda thought that usual AmigaGuide environment wouldn't
 be enough to present these great modules for public, so our coding
 division programmed a most brilliant front-end for them. With some
 things added, Silly Whinings was born. A gory birth. From wombs of
 bitches it was born. Oh yes... Blood 'n splatter!


 2. Requirements
 ---------------
 An AGA-Amiga with lots of free memory (2mb CHIP is enough)
 A disk which can handle 3.5 megs of data. HD is okay.
 This production will not work from floppies. We are sick and
 tired of the other groups doing lame trackloaders and old-fashioned crap.
 If you don't have suitable storage device, it's time to go to the
 store and purchase one. This is certainly worth it.


 3. Usage
 --------
 Just start the Pussy, from CLI or SHELL. Your current directory
 must be the dir where Pussy and it's datafiles are (Silly_Whinings
 in original archives). Otherwise Pussy will go mad, contaminated
 blood will stain your whereabouts and other horrible things happen.

 Then you can select modules with your dear mousie. You can also
 scroll the screen with mouse. Beware of the ugly dudes! In the text
 window, try clicking places "tune / general" and sliding gadgets
 for different texts and information about the modules.

 Enormous secret part included - Don't forget the strategic places!


 4. Bugs
 -------
 Harvey's dog ate almost all replay-sources as well as Sorsso's
 original scrolltext. So there's a pile of incompatible modules in
 YouPlayThese-directory. Use your favourite player to play them.
 As well as the modules used in the frontend, they are all released
 today. ZeRoDaY modules! Gigacool, eh?


 5. Credits
 ----------
 Modules by the Authors
 Modules supplied by Sorsso
 Interactive Front-End & TG:n NalleKarkit by Teuvo Tursas
 Secret Part, Packing & Documents by Tailgunner


 6. Greetings

Points : 9

Sorsso : Bass and drums are great, and the piano-playing is not ripped from
         the arse either.
Points : 10

         melody. Brilliant!
Points : 10

**************************************************************************
*** 2ND. ALE / SARVET: Soit Ite Kitaral (total: 50/60)

SexyJ  : Goings-on music
Points : 9

Honey  : Pop to the urban people
Points : 7

TailG  : Although this is not guitar which plays the tune, it sounds quite
         good. Fast playing, interesting, melodic. Huh. The song has
         some uninteresting synth sections.
Points : 9

Teuvo  : Nice melody. Reminds me of the tunes in Ultima V. Synth-sections
         were nice additions.
Points : 9

Sorsso : It become better all the time till the end. Nice sounding
        instrumental.
Points : 9

IceD   : Samples do not fit together, it spoils this melodic piece.
         The problem mentioned above bothers many times during the song.
Points : 7

*** 4TH. TG & KARZA : H.H.K. '93 (total: 47/50)

SexyJ  : Cool christmas song.
Points : 10

Honey  : My god, what a goings-on!
Points : 9

TailG  : I'm not one to comment this brilliant masterpiece.
Points : 7

Teuvo  : I used to sing this song when I was a puppy. Short enough.
Points : 8

Sorsso : Almost perfect, but this is not composers original tune but
         a cover version.
Points : 7

IceD   : Averagely mixed classic. This is so shite that you have to look
         for another one that is as good as this.
Points : 6

**************************************************************************
*** 5TH. JUSELIUS MAAMIES: Vinku (total: 45/50)

SexyJ  : Boring.
Points : 7

Honey  : A russian christmas song.
Points : 6

TailG  : The excellent russian atmosphere is quite often ruined with
         poor synths. Nice drums. Neo-classical experience. Good for
         RPG-game.
Points : 9

Teuvo  : Couple of nice parts. The frequency of the main instrument was
         too high. Almost perfect ending.
Points : 7

Sorsso : The author has been listening to some classic music lately.
         Part-time boring but otherwise good. Nice bassdrums.
Points : 8

IceD   : Ordinary module, the beat is too fast in some places.
         Simple, good melody.
Points : 8

**************************************************************************
*** 5TH. MONK: No Tears (total: 45/50)

SexyJ  : C-64 music.
Points : 9

Honey  : C-64 Cobra
Points : 6

TailG  : Fairly good chip tune.
Points : 8

Teuvo  : Pretty good chip tune.
Points : 8

Sorsso : Redundant, boring, stabile, cryogenic. I've heard worse songs though.
Points : 6

IceD   : Small chiptune. Cunning, but short. Reminds me of some tune from
         C64-game, which I own.
Points : 8

**************************************************************************
*** 5TH. TEMEN: Passing Space And Time (total: 45/50)

SexyJ  : Peaceful
Points : 8

Honey  : Cottonmusic.
Points : 7

TailG  : If we don't count Sorsso, this is the most boring sonsabitch
         I've ever heard. And it's absolutely too fucking long.
Points : 5

Teuvo  : Relaxing. Good elevator music. Doesn't bother too much.
Points : 8

Sorsso : If one is going to go to bed, and he doesn't feel sleepy,
         this song will surely help!
Points : 6

IceD   : This is quality trance. Samples ok! Enough melody for trance.
Points : 9

**************************************************************************
*** 6TH. STROBO / STELLAR: No Point (total: 42/60)

SexyJ  : Hard to say. Jumputi jumputi.
Points : 8

Honey  : Techno is STILL from butthole, but it's very good!
Points : 7

TailG  : Dance/tekno/trance/bull-overdose. This is one in a quantillion.
Points : 6

Teuvo  : I've got nothing to say.
Points : 6

Sorsso : Typical techno-piledriver. No melody.
Points : 6

IceD   : As I'm a tekno-freak, I consider this module as quite good.
         Beginning is a little too long, otherwise good prodigy-mix.
Points : 9

**************************************************************************
*** 6TH. ROADRUNNER: Bi (Cyber Edit) (total: 42/60)

SexyJ  : Too much jumputus.
Points : 6

Honey  : I don't like techno.
Points : 6

TailG  : Not repeating the same shit all the time. The beep-sound was
         changed to boop-sound quite often so it didn't become too boring. :)
Points : 8

Teuvo  : It just made me thought about visiting the bathroom.
Points : 7

Sorsso : The composer surely can make music, but "that something" was
         missing.
Points : 8

IceD   : Average tekno, could be faster. It becomes too complicated in some
         parts. The beat on the background could be more tekno-like.
         Because the beat is there almost all the time, it could have
         been sampled better. "Melody" is simple but fitting.
Points : 7

**************************************************************************
*** 6TH. JUKKA LEMMETTY: (Jukan Juhla) 20 (total: 42/60)

SexyJ  : Phew!
Points : 7

Honey  : <can not judge his own thingy>
Points : 7

TailG  : I hate the drum beat, really. Typical demo/intro tune. Boring.
         Perhaps a good piece when one wants to get really mad.
         Propably technically good as it could have been taken from
         any "elite"-group lamedemonstration.
Points : 6

Sorsso : Jolly good song. I like to listen to this. Honest.
         Not a straight-forward tune. Includes some great melodies.
Points : 9

IceD   : Hey, this one's got some melodies also! WOW! Melodic normal module,
         nothing new, but still listenable.
Points : 8

Teuvo  : Boring nonsense crap. Still missing the bongo-drums.
Points : 6

**************************************************************************
*** 7TH. DER PIIPO: Suolaa, Suolaa, Kasvo (total: 41/50)

SexyJ  : Traditional computer music
Points : 8

Honey  : Estonish fuckings
Points : 6

TailG  : Everyone thought that C64 is long gone. This song is proof that
         his haunting shadow still lurks over the unsuspecting world.
Points : 7

Teuvo  : Awful instruments. Sounds like my brother "playing" his guitar.
Points : 4

Sorsso: Personal, artistic, psychedelic.
Points : 8

IceD   : The author has done chip-tunes previosly, I see.
         Good example on how to make SICK but good chip-tune.
Points : 8

**************************************************************************
*** 8TH. ALE / SARVET: Energian Pursuminen (total: 39/40)

SexyJ  : Oh, well...
Points : 7

Honey  : Techno sucks. Techno is pig good!
Points : 7

TailG  : Beginning was weird enough, well then came this 2Unlimited
         along. Oh weed.
Points : 6

Teuvo  : I'd rather call this "Paskan Pursuaminen".
Points : 5

Sorsso : That's what I call boring! Typical technomusic. IMHO.
Points : 6

IceD   : Another tekno-tune, repeating too much, but not the worst
         one I've heard.
Points : 8

**************************************************************************
*** 9TH. BROMAN: Eric Clapton's "Sunshine Of Your Love" (total: 37/40)

SexyJ  : Eric Clapton rules. Good guitar sound, or what's that? Yeah
Points : 5

Honey  : Oh boy, this guy really can stay in the rhythm
Points : 6

TailG  : Sweet seventies! Sounds like Black Sabbath with awesome
         speed metal parts! Vocals fit perfectly. This is THE Tune.
Points : 10

Teuvo  : I like beatles. This is not beatles.
Points : 7

Sorsso : Eric "Heavy-Metal" Clapton. This is some major bull. Unbearable.
Points : 4

IceD   : Oh help! Samples are from anus, blended like tomatoes in ketchup!
         When one makes a song out of these, it doesn't interest me to
         listen another time. I'm not sure about the musical skills of the
         author.
Points : 5

**************************************************************************
*** 10TH. BROMAN: Estonia-The-Fuckin'-Mass-Suicide-But-Who-Wanted-To-Die
          (total: 36/40)

SexyJ  : The same was repeated too much.
Points : 5

Honey  : Quite a courageous shot!
Points : 6

TailG  : The lyrics were ultra-perverse, no question. The sleepy voice,
         the hollow melodies. Cool. Cliche bells in the beginning.
         Absolutely creepy one, but poorly constructed.
Points : 7

Teuvo  : A moody tribute to the victims. I only missed the bongo-drums.
Points : 8

Sorsso : Poor vocals, not enough strenght in them. Lyrics were cliche
         politic propaganda. Too repeating.
Points : 5

IceD   : Another one riding on the fame of the ESTONIA-name. No megamixes.
         Defecation in a box-shaped container.
Points : 5

**************************************************************************
*** 10TH. ZEUS / DOMINATION: Metalli-Mika (total: 36/60)

SexyJ  : It doesn't go in any note.. you know.. erm.. I mean..
Points : 5

Honey  : Fucking cool fuck, man.
Points : 7

TailG  : Mike should tune his guitar. I wonder how the Amiga can miss
         the rhythm so easily.
Points : 7

Teuvo  : I thought they were drilling outside the flat.
Points : 5

Sorsso : Sounds quite unfinished. Awesome guitar playing.
Points : 5

IceD   : The beginning is awesome, it could have been anything, but NOT
         something like this. Failure as a metal song.
Points : 7

**************************************************************************
*** 11TH. SAMULI LEHTONEN: Painless (total: 35/60)

SexyJ  : Fucking clowns, heavy assholes
Points : 4

Honey  : Ooooooooh shit
Points : 5

TailG  : This -almost- reaches the unreachable level of RRR. It's the
         attitude, not the quality!
Points : 10

Teuvo  : Gee! Knight Rider rules!
Points : 5

Sorsso : Just like Judas Priest and Accept. Weird drum-patterns.
Points : 5

IceD   : Err... Someone could have tuned the guitar before the song was
         made. And the melody could be better too, it rapes me ears
         couple 'o times when the guitar plays 2 high frequences u nou
         man. Best parts were beginning and the end. At the middle -
         nothing special.
Points : 6
