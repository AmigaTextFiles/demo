Implant is sort of a musicpack with ads, news, mesages and of course mods and
 chipmods. From issue no.4 we will also include a chart (original, ehh??!).
But don't you just  h a t e  filling out those  h u g e  votesheets?? Yep, we
  know... that's why there will only be  t w o  categories in Implant; best
swapper and best musician. But why these?  S w a p p e r  because "everyone"
 does a little bit of swapping, so this should be easy.  M u s i c i a n  is
           quite obvious I guess, since Implant is a music pack...

  The rules goes like this: You are not allowed to vote for any  members of
    A p a t h y.  You are not allowed to vote for any members of  y o u r
  o w n  g r o u p.  And finally, you can't give votes to  y o u r s e l f.
  You can vote for the official spreaders of this pack, as long as they are
  not members of Apathy or your own group. Ok, points are given like this:
  five points to number one on your list, four to the second, three to the
             third, two to the fourth and one point to the rest.

   We have put up a voting tool at our internet site like we also have for
 F e e d b a c k,  so those of you who have access to i-net might prefer to
 use this. Check out: "http://home.sn.no/~svgustav/apathy.htm". Those of you
  who haven't; send this votesheet to one of our official spreaders, or you
 could send it back to whoever sent it to you and it will probably end up at
                     the right place sooner or later...
