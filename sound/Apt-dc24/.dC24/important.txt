This lha-archive originally contained these files:

c/assign
c/Eighty
c/FadeType
c/SetPatch
DC24
DC24.info
devs/system-configuration
file_id.diz
fonts/MicroKnight.font
fonts/MicroKnight/8
libs/diskfont.library
s/startup-sequence
s/text   

But the guy responsible on aminet wouldn't upload it like this (beats me?!) 
so I have removed some of the files and will try to upload it again..

The files were only a bit important if you want to run digitalchips from 
disk, but most people these days have hd's (hIPPHURAAy) so it probably 
doesn't make any difference..  

spread'n enjoy!
