Hi!   After some months of delay, Apathy
has the pleasure of welcoming you to the
third  issue of Implant!  We hope you'll
enjoy the mods in this issue.

Credits for Implant #3 are:

Code..................Mr.X/Apathy^Giants
Main graphics...............Point/Apathy
Additional graphics.....Sunscream/Apathy
Design....................Mr.X and Point

The  modules are composed by Eagle, Maf,
Woober,  DT214, Dvize, Raze, Enigmus H.,
Dr.Death and Trump.  Thanks to you guys!

Official release date for Implant #3 has
been set to June 2nd, 1997.
The  controls  are  quite obvious, so it
probably  don't need any explaination...
well, here we go anyway!

Keyboard controls: Left/right cursorkeys
changes  pages  and  up/down  alters the
volume.   Use  F1-F9  to select modules.
ESC exits.

Mouse  controls:  Flip pages by clicking
on   the   prev/next   buttons.   Switch
between main, news, ads and messys using
the buttons at the bottom.  Holding down
both  mousebuttons at the same time will
exit Implant.



Some words from Point coming up...as you
can  see  we  decided to use my poor gfx
for  this  issue  aswell.   Sorry  about
that!   Sunscream  is working on the new
graphics,  but  since  it's not finished
yet, we had no option but to use the old
gfx once more.

Another  thing  which didn't turn out as
we  hoped,  is  the  charts.  Due to the
rather  small amount of votesheets we've
collected, the chart had to be postponed
until  a later issue.  So do us a favour
- VOTE!

Send  your  votes to any of our official
collectors,  or  submit  it  by email to
svgustav@sn.no.   We also have an online
voting  system at our official homepage:
"http://home.sn.no/~svgustav/apathy.htm"

If  you would like to become an official
spreader and collector of votes, contact
me   (email:   svgustav@sn.no)  or  Mr.X
(email:  morten.bolstad@login.eunet.no).
You'll  find  our snail addys at the end
of this text.

This  issue  was actually supposed to be
released  at  The Gathering '97, but due
to  some  bugs  (and quite some laziness
aswell!) we were `a bit' delayed.  Hehe,
shit  happens!   Hopefully we'll be able
to  bring you new issues more frequently
in the future...  :)

Talking  about  the  future;  things are
slowly  starting  to look better for the
Amiga  now,  don't  they?  Gathering and
Symposium brought us some new asskicking
demos,  Gateway  will most probably take
over   the   production   of  the  Amiga
computer   (or  will  THIS  buyout  fail
aswell??),  the  RISC-accelerators  from
phase5  should  be  out  any  minute and
ClickBOOM  has  announced  that they are
planning   the  conversions  of  several
popular PC-games.

On   the   other  hand,  more  and  more
demogroups  are  moving  over  to the PC
platform,  and the scene in general seem
to  have  become VERY lazy.  There still
hasn't  been released a new Amiga model,
and  the  A/box  won't  be out before 12
months from now (which MAY be too late).

I'm convinced that 1997 will be the year
that  decides  our  beloved Amiga's fate
once  and  for  all, let's just hope for
the  best outcome!  Of course there will
`always'  exist  people who stick to the
Amiga,   but  unless  nothing  drastical
happens, the Amiga community will end up
like  the  C64  one...with  only a small
core of fanatic demosceners left.

Errrm...ok,   so  I'm  not  Nostradamus,
however  I  still  like  to think that I
know what I'm talking about...hehe!  :-)

Anyway,  before  we  move  on, lets hear
what our mighty coder, Mr.X, has to say!
(This  is the moment you've been waiting
for, Morten!  Hehe, ordet er ditt...)

Hello Folx.

Yeah,  issue  3  is finally here after a
couple  of  months with lazyness and bug
fixing.

This issue was supposed to be released 
at The Gathering 97 in the easter, but a
strange bug appeared and fucked those 
plans up, but now with some help from my
pal Ben Wyatt (Bwyatt@paston.co.uk)
it's all fixed so you guy's can enjoy 
this third issue.

The  release  date for Issue 4 is set to
Kindergarden  97  if  everything goes as
planned.

Issue   4   will  be  even  better  with
completly new code, GFX and design.

There  will  also be a mag part in 78x20
so  you  can read the news, messages and
adverts in full screen.

So come on and support us NOW!

Allright, this is Point on the keys once
again...I  was thinking that maybe you'd
be wanting to read some short info about
the  tunes  we've  picked  out  for this
issue, ehh??  Here we go:
18th Feb
Hotkey: F1

Aggressive chiptune, tracked by DT214 of
Void.   Btw,  try to guess when this mod
was  made!   (I can tell you that it was
some day in February...hehe!)







Song info:
36.186 bytes unc0mpressed
7 tracks
6 different patterns used
Daze
Hotkey: F2

This   little   tune   was   chipped  by
Enigmus H.   of  the new Norwegian group
Instinct.  Supplied by Punisher.








Song info:
13.332 bytes uncompressed
8 tracks
4 different patterns used
Dyna-K Music 4
Hotkey: F3

Unusual  mod by Maf/Syndrome, made for a
game.  A bit old, but you SHOULDN'T have
heard  it  before  anyway...   Thanks to
Eagle  for  sending it (and ofcourse Maf
for letting us use it!)






Song info:
176.508 bytes uncompressed
9 tracks
9 different patterns used
Fuzzing Around
Hotkey: F4

I asked Trump at The Gathering if he had
any modules we could use in Implant, and
he  gave  us  this  nice, relaxing tune.
Enjoy!







Song info:
118.194 bytes uncompressed
17 tracks
15 different patterns used
Humanoid
Hotkey: F5

This  great module was tracked by Woober
of  Cannabis.  Judging from the sound of
this  tune,  I'd  say  he's  one  of the
better  Norwegian  musicians  of  today.
Well, that's just MY opinion...judge for
yourself!





Song info:
125.340 bytes uncompressed
23 tracks
19 different patterns used
Hungry Grassers
Hotkey: F6

This  short  chiptune is written by Raze
of  Ambrosia^Cosmic Woodheads.  Supplied
by Draw/Ambrosia.








Song info:
10.580 bytes uncompressed
5 tracks
5 different patterns used
Keen2play
Hotkey: F7

Chipmod  by  Dvize/LED^Devious  Designs.
"Hey, isn't he a graphician??" Sure, but
as  you  can  hear, he's also capable of
some  tracking.   I  don't  know whether
this  tune  has  been used in any prods,
but I do know it's a bit old...





Song info:
18.098 bytes uncompressed
12 tracks
11 different patterns used
Phoenix
Hotkey: F8

We  had  to use one of Eagle's excellent
mods in this issue aswell...this time he
made us a goa module.  Thanks man!








Song info:
194.172 bytes uncompressed
34 tracks
32 different patterns used
The Seventh Storm
Hotkey: F9

Nice  guitar  mod  by Dr.Death.  He made
this  last summer, and (as he said) he's
capable of making much better music now.
I like this one anyway... :-) Enjoy!

      Apathy 1997 - we don't care!
