We found a bug in the last minutes before release!!!

If you have a gfx card, don't select any 8bit screenmodes!!!
The display will look trashy!

But why would you run in in 8bit mode if you have a fancy gfxcard!?
It works fine in 16 and 24 bit, use them instead bwoy!

All AGA modes works, so AGA users shouldn't worry!
