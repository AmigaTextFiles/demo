 We apologise for the long delay on this issue of beeps.
 It took us much longer than we expected to finish it.

 But then again, have you ever seen such a cute & original design?
 No, thats what we thought too.
 Every issue of beeps has/gets it's own design, so no easy
 "put some new modules into the old design" chippack idea.

 We hope you like our layout/music and if you think THIS
 is original then let the world know and vote for it, don't
 follow the stream.

 Bye for now..
                                                     Prodigy/Oops!
