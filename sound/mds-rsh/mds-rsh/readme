    | Requires AMiGA with enough free |
    | chipmem / fastram.  Should also |
    | run on NON-AGA-Systems  as only |
    | extra-half-brite mode  is used. |
    | If the engine  quites  suddenly |
    | while  loading   "satisfaction" |
    | then your chipmem  was  to low! |
    |                                 | 
    | I  know that hard techno musics |
    | is  not  the taste of everyone. |
    | Please ,as blakkhars intro says |
    | OPEN YOUR HEART  AND  OPEN YOUR |
    | MIND...  and listen through the |
   _| tracks    ...d!RT!E in DEC 2004 |_
