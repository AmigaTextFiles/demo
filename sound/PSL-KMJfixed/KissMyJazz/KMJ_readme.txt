Well,  since  this  collection  contains  only  old mono and 8-bit tunes,
we advise  you  to select either AHI Fast 14-bit mono or Fast 8-bit mono modes
(it  depends on your CPU speed).  Then please enter to AHI Advanced Options
and  ensure  that  'Master  Volume'  is  set to WITH CLIPPING.  This option
prevents sound from distortions but only when set to 'with clipping'.  It's
very  important!   Then check 'CPU Usage Limit' - please set it to 100% not
to  overload  your  CPU.  Debug level should ofcourse be set to 'off'.  And
please  use  old AHI (f.e.  4.180 will be good).  The latest version of AHI
features declick (thank you, Martin Blom!!) but it's seriously slower.

Hardware & memory requirements:

  at least 030,
  and OS 3.0+ (3.1+ for WCP),
  1.5mb chip mem & 8mb fast mem,
  and... Amiga.
