About

I just felt i should do a classic music pack, so here it is. Maybe
quite a big file for 5 tunes, but one of them is almost 200000 bytes.

Instructions (is there any?)
----------------------------
Select tune with mouse by moving up/down and press left mouse button.
Exit the chippack by pressing the right mouse button.

That's it!

PS! My start up/exit routines are old as hell and doesn't like the famous
VBR to moved somewhere else.
