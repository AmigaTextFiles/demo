         Puzzle presents a synthonic and symphonic musicdisk called:


                                 ELEMENTS
                                 --------

                         Music & Code: MeloManiac

                            Graphics: Tactica




INFO:          Elements is a music-disk divided into two parts, one
               containing synthesizer music, the other film/orchestral
               music. The demo is system-friendly, multitasks and
               can run in PAL or DblPAL. The modules have been packed with
               CrunchMania and can be depacked. A little problem in this
               production is the amount of 'clicking' sounds created by
               the replayer/the Amiga's hardware - this is especially
               noticeable in the orchestral tunes and samples using
               a lot of high frequencies.


REQUIREMENTS:  Music-disks normally don't require that much RAM, but due
               to the highres 256-colour graphics and big module sizes
               it requires 1.5MB of Chip RAM and 2MB of Fast RAM to be
               able to play all modules. Of course an AGA Amiga is
               essential too.
