   You have seen the BOING demo and its many clones, but nothing can

prepare you for... MAMMOTH BOING!

   MAMMOTH BOING! is the biggest, largest, most utterly huge BOING demo

ever!  (Well, as far as I know.  There's a lot of Amiga stuff out there...)

To witness MAMMOTH BOING!, all you need is an Amiga with a Fatter Agnus,

ECS, or AGA (>=1 meg of Chip Ram).

   MAMMOTH BOING! was coded in Amos Professional by Psychosoft's very own

Kit Felice!  Psychosoft is now a proud affiliate (is that the right word?)

of Dark Unicorn Productions, a loosely-knit confederation of AMOS Pro

coders devoted to bringing the very best PD/Shareware Amiga games, demos,

and utilities to you!

   DUP is always looking for new members!  If you think you can "hack it"

in Amos Pro (or any language, I guess), you should join!  There is no

obligation to you, you'd keep everything that you made (programs, money,

whatever).  All you would do is put the official DUP logo on your title

screen somewhere and promote other DUP members' programs in your README

files.  It's a great idea - we'd all be helping to spread eachother's

programs around, and just think of the publicity!  Being part of a semi-well-

known-if-not-totally-unheard-of software organization rules!

(See the documentation in Psycho Squares Deluxe for complete instructions

on how to join, if there's any DUP wannabees out there!)


DUP Stuff that's out there as of 9/1/94 that I can think of right off

the top of my head:


"Psycho Squares Deluxe"
  By Shane Monroe (our fearless leader)

"Scorched Tanks"
  By Michael Welch

"The Gladiators of Dagania"
  By Kit Felice


Future DUP products to watch for:


"Djinn - The Battle of the Stones"
  By Shane Monroe

"It's The Pits!"
  By Kit Felice


Later!
