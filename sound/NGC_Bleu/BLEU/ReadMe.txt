                     This is the new music-disk from:

                         << Blue Silence / NGC >>



Some features:

- Requires AGA Chipset & HardDrive.
- Properly ALLOCATES the Audio-Channels via the audio.device.
- Entirely MULTI-TASKING (try Amiga+N to come back to the Workbench) !
- Clean exiting to the system.
- Uses xpkmaster.library (© Urban Mueller) for file loading. (°)
- Pattern Up & Down allowed (try right & left arrows) ! (°)
- FadeOut routine when changing modules ! (°)



Additional (final) coding (and debugging!) by:   >> Gryzor / Pro-Wizzz <<
(all the features marked with (°) and some little fixes..)

I'not from "NGC" no..no... but a very good friend of all these delirious
guys quoted in the Author-field :-))



XPK Libraries are supplied, just copy them in your "LIBS:" if you don't
already have them (but you should!).



                             Enjoy it, Folks !
