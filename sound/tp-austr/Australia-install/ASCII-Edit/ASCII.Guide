@ENDNODE

@NODE TOOL1 "Freehand Tool"

@{fg shine}@{b}The Freehand Tool@{fg text}

The Freehand Tool is used to draw onto the screen as you would in any other
paint package.  You can change the way the Freehand Tool works by selecting
one  of the Special Freehand modes from the Tools/Freehand...  menu.  There
is  one  normal  freehand  mode,  two  special modes and a combined special
mode.@{ub}

*  In  the  foreground  the  Freehand  Tool  uses  the character, currently
displayed in the @{"Brush Display" LINK TGad} in the Tools window.

* In background mode it will change a single character's background colour.

* The way a character responds to a freehand drawing action depends on the
settings in the @{"Drawmode" LINK DRAWMODE} window.
@ENDNODE

@NODE TOOL2 "Fill Line Tool"

@{fg shine}@{b}The Fill Line Tool@{fg text}

This  tool  will  perform  a floodfill, but in a special way.  It will only
fill  up horizontal lines in either foregound or background mode, using the
settings from the @{"Drawmode" LINK Drawmode} window.@{ub}

*  In  foreground  mode  it  will fill the selected line in the foreground,
using the activated colour(drawmode) and the current brush character.

*  In  background  mode  it  will  fill the selected line in the background
changing it's colour depending on the settings in the drawmode window.
@ENDNODE

@NODE TOOL3 "Airbrush Tool"

@{fg shine}@{b}The Airbrush Tool@{fg text}

The Airbrush Tool will act like you are painting with a spraycan that is
filled with text. You can change the behaviour of the Airbrush Tool in the
Tools/Airbrush... menu option.@{ub}

* In the foreground this tool will spray the current brush character, using
the  current  colour(drawmode)  using  the  speed and radius you set in the
Airbrush window.

* In background mode it will spray in the background, not changing any text
in  the  foreground.   What  exactly happens depende on the settings in the
@{"Drawmode" LINK DRAWMODE} window.

*  In  the Tools menu, you can use the Airbrush...  option to set the speed
and the size of the Airbrush Tool.
@ENDNODE

@NODE TOOL4 "Straight Line Tool"

@{fg shine}@{b}The Straight Line Tool@{fg text}

Use  this tool to draw straight line from one point to another in a similar
way to other paint packages.  To draw a line simply click and hold the left
mousebutton  at the starting position and then drag the mouse to the ending
position.  Then release the mousebutton and the line is drawn.@{ub}

*  In the foreground the Line Tool uses the current brush character, colour
and/or drawmode settings.  It will not affect the background colours on the
screen.

*  In the background this tool uses the current colour/drawmode settings to
change the background.
@ENDNODE

@NODE TOOL5 "Draw Box Tool"

@{fg shine}@{b}The Draw Box Tool@{fg text}

The Box tool can be used to draw a box, either open or filled in either the
foreground  or  the background.  There are two ways of drawing boxes useing
this  tool.   You can toggle between them using the Tools/Draw Box...  menu
option.@{ub}

*  To draw an open Box, activate the Box Tool by clicking on the upper half
of the button, to draw a filled box click on the lower half.

*  In  foreground mode the Box Tool uses the current brush character or the
special  mode (depending on the settings in the Tools/Draw Box...  option).
The  result  also depends on the settings in the Drawmode window and/or the
currently activated colour.

*  In  background mode this tool only works if the special Draw Box mode is
turned  off  (see  above).  It uses the current colour/drawmode settings to
change the background.
@ENDNODE

@NODE TOOL6 "Draw Ellipse Tool"

@{fg shine}@{b}The Draw Ellipse Tool@{fg text}

The  Ellipse  tool can be used to draw an ellipse, either open or filled in
either the foreground or the background.@{ub}

*  To  draw  an  open ellipse, activate the Ellipse Tool by clicking on the
upper half of the button, to draw a filled ellipse click on the lower half.

*  In  foreground  mode  the Ellipse Tool uses the current brush character.
The  result  depends  on  the  settings  in  the Drawmode window and/or the
currently activated colour.

* In background mode this tool uses the current colour/drawmode settings to
change the background.
@ENDNODE

@NODE TOOL7 "Text Edit Tool"

@{fg shine}@{b}The Text Edit Tool@{fg text}

Use  this  tool to edit foreground text using the keyboard.  This tool does
not  depend  on  wether you are in foreground or background mode, it always
works  in  foreground  mode  since  background  text  hasn't  been invented
yet.@{ub}

*  Note  that  the Text Edit Tool does not perform any action that involves
moving  text  around.   This  is  to prevent you from destroying previously
drawn foreground 'graphics'.

Therefore  you will always be in overwrite mode.  Insert mode would require
shifting text to the right if you insert something in the midle of a line.

The  Backspace  key  DOES delete the character preceding the cursor, but it
will not shift the rest of the line to the left.

The Delete key WILL delete the character at cursor position but it will NOT
shift the rest of the line to the left.

The  Return key will return the cursor to the starting position at the next
line, but you can not insert lines by pressing Return.

*  To  move text around you'll have to pick it up as a brush and then go to
the  Brush  Options  window  (via the Tools/Brush/Options menu) and set the
Brush pasting mode to 'Front Only'.  Then paste your text down wherever you
want it.  (Be sure you are in the 'Normal' drawmode)
@ENDNODE

@NODE TOOL8 "Clear Tool"

@{fg shine}@{b}The Clear Tool@{fg text}

Actually  this  is  the  same  as  the freehand tool, but instead of adding
foreground  or  background information, you can use the Clear Tool to erase
background AND foreground information.  This tool does not depend on wether
you are in foreground or background mode.@{ub}

* Note that the Clear Tool clears the background to the currently activated
colour.  The foreground info is removed.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Fix

@{fg shine}@{b}The Fix Button@{fg text}

Press  this  when  you are satisfied with what you created so far.  This will
update  the  Undo  buffer.  After you Fixed the changes you can not Undo them
anymore.   Any  Undo action after this will restore your project to the state
it was in when you last pressed Fix.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Undo

@{fg shine}@{b}The Undo Feature@{fg text}@{ub}

Use  this  function  to  undo  everything you changed since the last time you
pressed  the  @{"Fix" LINK Fix} button.  You can change the name of the Undo file in the
ASCII-Edit Configuration editor.
@ENDNODE

@NODE COL

@{fg shine}@{b}The Colour Gadgets@{fg text}

These  are the 8 colours you can use.  Simply select one by clicking on it.
Activating  a  colour,  sets that colour to be the currently used colour in
the  area  you  are  editing  in (Foreground or Background).@{ub}

*  Active  colours  are  only used if the settings in the Colourmode window
   allow this.
@ENDNODE

@NODE FrontBack

@{fg shine}@{b}The Front/Back switch@{fg text}

This  switch  is  used  to toggle between foreground (Front) and background
(Back)  modes.   In  foreground  mode all tools will draw using the current
ascii  character  and  colour(mode).   In  background  you  can  change the
fieldcolour of any character on the screen using any tool.
@ENDNODE

@NODE CLR

@{fg shine}@{b}Clear Project@{fg text}@{ub}

In the window that appears, select what information you want to clear.  The
projects' size will not change (even when you choose 'All').  To change the
size, you must initialize a new project using the Project menuoption New.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Redraw

@{fg shine}@{b}Redraw@{fg text}

This simply forces ASCII Edit to redraw the entire screen.@{ub}
@ENDNODE

@NODE DRAWMODE

@{fg shine}@{b}The Draw Mode Window@{fg text}

Selecting this feature  brings  up  a  window titled 'Draw Mode'.  Use this
window  to  determine what happens to the screen if you draw something.  Be
aware  that  the  drawing mode works for Background or Foreground, although
some are only useful in foreground mode.@{ub}

The CycleGadget can be used to select one of the following modes:

@{b}Normal (Use Active)@{ub}
This  means  that the currently activated colour will be used when you draw
something using one of the tools.

@{b}Invert Bg or Fg@{ub}
When you draw something, you won't be adding any new characters.  What will
happen  is that the colour of all characters you use are inversed.  This is
done  by substracting the number of the colour at the drawing position from
the  maximum  number  of  colours  available  (8).   You may use the 'Use x
Colours' CycleGadget' to change the maximum number of colours used for this
inverse  mode  (you  can  still  use  all  8 colours, but the outcome of an
inverse calculation will be different).

@{b}Swap Bg<->Fg@{ub}
When  drawing,  you  won't  be  adding  any  new characters.  In stead, all
characters  you  touch  will  have  their foreground and background colours
swapped.

@{b}Recoulour To Active@{ub}
This  is  one  of  the  most  usefull  draw  modes!  In stead of adding new
characters  by  drawing, only the colour of the existing characters will be
changed.

@{b}Erase Bg or Fg@{ub}
This wil erase all characters that you touch when drawing.
@ENDNODE

@NODE BackFront

@{fg shine}@{b}The Area Switch@{fg text}

Use this CycleGadget to switch between the two working areas.

Back  :@{ub}   Background  mode.   In this mode you will be able to draw in the
background area of the screen.  This means that only 'Fieldcolours' will be
affected  by  the  drawing operations.  All foreground text will remain the
same as it was, so you can edit background without damaging the foreground.

@{b}Front :@{ub}  Foreground mode.  Or Textmode if you like.  All drawing operations
will  take  place  in the foreground area.  The foreground area can contain
any  ASCII  character, the empty space in each character will be considered
to  be background (so a Space will have no effect on the foreground, except
that it will erase the old character if there is one).

*  The Text tool will always be in foreground mode (of course).

*  The  Replace  Colour function from the Options menu will only operate in
   the activated area. (Front/Back)

*  The  settings  of this CycleGadget have no effect on the brushtools, for
   that you need to select the Brush Options item form the Options menu.
   (Left-Amiga B)

*  All tools will only operate in the activated area.
@ENDNODE

@NODE GetBsh

@{fg shine}@{b}Pick Up A Brush@{fg text}

Press this to activate the Brush Grabbing feature.  Now, while holding down
the  left  mouse  button,  draw a box around the area you want to grab as a
brush.   This  will  pick  up  all  information inside the box (Foreground,
Background, Colours, Fontstyles, everything)@{ub}

*  After  grabbing, the 'Use Brush'  tool is automatically activated in the
   Tools window.
@ENDNODE

@NODE UseBsh

@{fg shine}@{b}Paste Current Brush@{fg text}

Press  this  to  activate the Use Brush tool.  This is only useful when you
have  already  grabbed  a  brush once.  When activated you can use the last
grabbed brush which will be in memory until you pick up a new one.@{ub}

If you don't want to use all the brushs' information to paste down, use the
Brush  Options feature from the Options menu.  If there is a brush, it will
be  displayed  in  the  top left corner of the Edit window, surrounded by a
black  border with the title 'Brush'.  A window will appear (Brush Options)
where   you  can  decide  what  brush  information  to  use.   (Background,
Foreground or Both) Also from this window you can XFlip or YFlip the brush, Invert
its colours or Swap its Background and Foreground colours.

@{b}IMPORTANT:@{ub}
Be aware that the currently activated Background Colour will not be visible
in  the brush if it is pasted down.  If you picked up a brush with black in
it,  and  you  have  activated  black  as  the background colour then, when
pasting  down  the  brush somewhere, all the black will be ignored.  If you
want  black  to  be displayed when the brush is pasted, you should activate
another background colour, and then paste the brush.  You may always change
the background colour.
@ENDNODE

@NODE TGad

@{fg shine}@{b}The Brush String Display@{fg text}

In  this  display  you can see which character is currently used as a brush
for  all  the  tools  (except for the Text tool, and the Paste Brush Tool).@{ub}

You  can change it pressing any key on the keyboard during editing.  If you
are  in  Background  mode  this display will show a cursor in the currently
activated colour.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Load

@{fg shine}@{b}The Load Window@{fg text}

After  selecting  Load, you will be presented with a filerequester.  Use it
to  select  a file.  ASCII-Edit will try to determine what type of file you
have selected.  The following types are known:

Custom Project files@{ub} (.proj)
If you selected a project file, a requester will ask if you are sure.  Note
that  loading a project means that all current information will be lost (if
you didn't save it)!

@{b}Custom Brush files@{ub} (.BSH)
When  a brush file was selected it will be loaded as such.  ASCII-edit will
automatically  activate  the 'Use Brush' tool in the tools window.  You can
then  paste the brush anywhere you want it.  It will remain in memory until
you pick up a new brush, or load onther one.

@{b}AmigaGuide files@{ub} (.Guide)
Selecting an AmigaGuide database will bring up a window where you can
select a node. For more info about this window, read @{"Loading Guides" LINK LoadGuide}.

@{b}Textfiles (ASCII)@{ub}
If  the  selected  file  was none of the above, it will be loaded as a text
file.   A  window  will pop up.  Use this to select which area to load.  If
the  file does not contain colour information (escape-codes), you can enter
a default colour in this window.  Unknown escape codes will be ignored.


@{b}NOTE:@{ub}
Text  and  Guide  files will be Merged into the current project if you load
front  or  back only.  This way you can load in the foreground of one file,
and the background of another.
But  if  you  load  a guides' foreground and background (both), the project
will  be  adjusted  in  size,  which  means  that it will be cleared before
loading (se no merging there).
@ENDNODE

@NODE Save2

@{fg shine}@{b}The Save Window@{fg text}@{ub}

This  brings  up  the  save  window.   Use  the  CycleGadget  to select the
fileformat (Project, ASCII, Script or AmigaGuide) and use the checkboxes to
select  what to save.  The settings of these checkboxes will not affect the
Project fileformat!
@ENDNODE

@NODE ScreenBox

@{fg shine}@{b}The Screen/Box Switch@{fg text}

Use this CycleGadget to select either "Screen" or "Box" mode:@{ub}


@{b}Screen:@{ub} Convert the loaded ILBM entirely, resizing it to fit the window.
@{b}Box   :@{ub} You can draw a box around the area you want to convert. The
            contents of the box will be sized to fit the window.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Convert

@{fg shine}@{b}Converting An Image@{fg text}

Pressing  this button will bring up a filerequester in which you may select
the  source  IFF  ILBM  picture.   ASCII  text  can  contain no more than 8
colours,  so  ASCII  Trace  will only use 8 colours.  If a picture contains
more,  they  are simply looped around (colour 8 to 0, colour 9 to 1, colour
10 to 2 etc.)@{ub}

After  selecting  a  picture  a  window the size of the screen will appear.
Resize  this  window to the size you want the project to be.  In the middle
of  this  window  you  can  see  the  width and height in characters.  When
finished, press the 'Done' button in the top left corner.

A  window  showing  the  loaded  picture appears.  If you selected Box-mode
rather  than  Screen-mode,  you  may  now draw a box around the part of the
picture  you  want  to convert, else the conversion will start immediately.
When  the  conversion  is  finished you will be back at the startup screen.
You can now save the project using the Save button.

What they mean
@{fg shine}Horizontal:@{fg text} ('-')@{ub}
The  character you choose will be used for specialmodes in the Freehand and
Box  tools  of  ASCII-Edit.   The  'Horizontal'  character will be used for
drawing horizontal lines.

@{fg shine}@{b}Vertical:@{fg text} ('|')@{ub}
This  character  will  be  used  to  draw vertical lines in special drawing
modes.  (see above)

@{fg shine}@{b}Corner1:@{fg text} ('+')@{ub}
This  character  will  be  used  to draw crossings between 'Horizontal' and
'Vertical'  characters.   It will also be used to draw the corners of boxes
in the special boxdrawing mode.

@{fg shine}@{b}Diagonal1:@{fg text} ('/')@{ub}
This character will be used to draw diagonal lines in freehand drawing mode
Special2  or  Special1&2.  It will be used when the mouse moved from bottom
left to top right or vice versa.

@{fg shine}@{b}Diagonal2:@{fg text} ('\')@{ub}
This character will be used to draw diagonal lines in freehand drawing mode
Special2 or Special1&2.  It will be used when the mouse moved from top left
to bottom right or vice versa.

@{fg shine}@{b}Corner2  :@{fg text} ('X')@{ub}
This  character  will  be  used  to  draw crossings between 'Diagonal1' and

@ENDNODE

@NODE CONF_UNDO "Configuration Editor (name of undo file)"

@{fg shine}@{b}The Undo Filebuffer@{fg text}

In this stringgadget you should enter the complete path and the filename of
the  Undo  filebuffer.  When you press Fix in the ASCII Editor it will save
the undobuffer to this file in the Project format.@{ub}

Make sure that the undofile can always be accessed! It should not be on a
floppy disk. My personal advise is to put it in the clipboard like this:

                           @{b}Clips:ASCII-Edit.UNDO@{ub}

If  you  type  an illegal name for the undofile (one that can't be opened),
ASCII-Edit  will  use  the  above default.  When you quit the ASCII-Editor,
the Undo filebuffer will be deleted.
@ENDNODE

@NODE CONF_SAVE "Configuration Editor (save config file)"

@{fg shine}@{b}Saving The Configuration File@{fg text}

When  you  press  this  button  the  configuration will be saved in your S:
directory as @{u}ASCII-Edit.Config@{uu}@{ub}

The  file  will be saved in a readable-by-human format.  That means you may
edit  it  using  a text-editor.  This is NOT recommended and should only be
done when you don't have the ASCII-Config program.

When you received the complete package, one configuration file is included.
You should copy it into your S: directory before you start working with
ASCII-Edit or ASCII-Config. This default file looks like this:

@NODE ASCII-Format "The ASCII Text Format"

@{fg shine}@{b}ASCII Text@{fg text}

"What is ASCII anyway?" you may ask.  Well, to put it simple:  ASCII is the
text  you  are  now  reading.   Yes, ASCII are all those lovely letters and
numbers  that  magically  appear  on the screen when you press the matching
key!@{ub}

Ofcourse  in  a normal textfile, you won't see more than about 80 different
ASCII  characters, but there are 256 of those characters!  So, where is the
rest?   You can see a lot of them by typing this in the Shell:  TYPE <file>
where file should be any random (non-text) file.  Now you will see that the
screen  starts  flashing  while strange-looking characters are all over the
place...   that's them!  Some of them have special functions (like flashing
the  screen,  scrolling  a line of text (line feed) or make the cursor jump
forward  some  steps).  One of those special characters is character number
27,  and  that's  the  only  character that ASCII-Edit needs to use for all
those special texts!



@{b}Escape Codes@{ub}

Character 27 is called ESC(APE) and is usually attached to the Esc key on
your keyboard. If you enter the Shell and press escape, you will see a
funny-looking character. If you use a normal font, it should be a square
bracket ([) with inversed colours (blank character on a black background).

The ASCII format uses this code for numerous things. I will only give you a
few (mainly the ones that ASCII-Edit uses), to find out more you could just
experiment some.



Cursor Movements...@{ub}

The  syntax  is  very simple.  An excape-code starts with the ESC character
followed  by a normal square bracket ([), then numeric value and the 'name'
of the code you are going to use...

For  example:  The code for making the cursor jump a number of steps to the
right  (without  printing  spaces)  is  C (not c, but C!).  So, to make the
curser move 10 characters to the right we type:

@{b}  @{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[10C@{ub}         (@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back} is the escape character!)



That's all really. We could do the same movement to the left, using code D:

@{b}  @{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[10D@{ub}  will do the job...



To move the cursor down 10 lines: @{b}@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[10B@{ub}

To move it back up again        : @{b}@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[10A@{ub}

I used the above 2 codes to do the scrolling of the logos in the Demo and
the installer. What I did is this:

@{fg fill}1. Create a variable called $ScrollUP containing 30 escape-codes for
   scrolling DOWN one line ( @{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[1B ).
2. Put the data that should be scrolled UP on the screen.
3. ECHO (print) the $ScrollUP variable.@{fg text}

The cursor will now move down the screen very quickly on a line by line
basis. When it reaches the bottom it will scroll everything aboveit upwards!
(This also happens when you reach the bottom of the screen when you are
typing directly into the shell...)

To scroll stuff down the screen, I did the same thing, but now with 30
times @{b}@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[1A@{ub} ...



To place the cursor on a certain line from the top, you need escapecode H:

  @{b}@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[10H@{ub}   will put the cursor at the start of the 10th line. Now you can
              place it anywhere on that line using the C code (see above)



@{b}Colours and Fontstyles@{ub}

The  nicest  code  of  all  has got to be m (m, not M!).  You can use it to
determine  text and field-colours (pens) and fontstyles (bold, underlined).
It works exactly the same as the above codes with the difference being that
you  can  not  see  the results of these codes immediately.  You only set a
colour  for  use  until a new code is entered.  Some codes can be combined,
other's reset the old values...

If  you  type  this in the Shell:  @{b}@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[1m@{ub} you will notice that the prompt
gets  back in a @{b}bold@{ub} fontstyle.  1m means you want @{b}bold@{ub} mode turned on.  To
turn  @{u}underline@{uu}  mode  on,  enter  4m  in stead of 1m.  Use 3m for
Italic and 0m to reset everything to normal.

@{b}NOTE:  @{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[0m@{ub}   will reset EVERYTHING to normal. All settings will be
                  overrided (including colour settings).


To change the colour of the text in the shell, use @{b}@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[3{ub}@{i}#@{ui}@{b}m@{ub}.  The @{i}# @{ui}may be
any number in the range of 0 to 7.  Normally this is set to 1 (black):

  @{b}@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[31m@{ub}

If you don't want the character itself changing colour, but only it's field
(background, paper, etc.) colour, use @{b}@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[4@{ub}@{i}#@{ui}@{b}m@{ub}.  Again @{i}# @{ui}may be any number
in the range of 0 to 7.  Normally this value is set to 0 (grey/blank):

  @{b}@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[40m@{ub}

If  you change the field colour, everytime you enter a space,  you will see
a cursorsized block in  the specified colour.  If you would want to leave a
blank space between 2 of those coloured blocks, you don't need to reset the
colour to 0, simply use the cursor-jumping codes.  It works for me!


@{fg shine}@{b}ASCII-Edit's Saving Methode@{fg text}@{ub}
(You don't need to read this. It's confusing. -Ed.)

ASCII-Edit saves ASCII-Files as followes:
If  a  foreground  colour  is  different from the one currently in use, the
colourchange  will  be  written  to  the file as soon as the foregrounddata
holds  a  character  other  than a space.  So if you created a project with
this line in it:

@{fg shine}I created     @{fg text}this      @{fg fill}project@{fg text}

ASCII-Edit will save the line as

@{b}@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[32mI created    @{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[31mthis      @{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[33mproject@{ub}

and NOT

@{b}@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[32mI created@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[31m    this@{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[33m      project@{ub}

EXCEPT  when you use Underlined.  If you use underlined the escapecode will
follow  directly after underlined mode is turned off.  Otherwise all spaces
lying  between  two  areas  that  contain  text  would  be underlined.  (??
Confusing  -Ed.)  Anyway,  I  won't  go  about explaining all this.  If you
really are that keen on knowing how ASCII-Edit saves ASCII-files, just save
some ASCII, load it in an editor and study.

@NODE Script-Format "The Script Format"

@{fg shine}@{b}Amiga Scripting@{fg text}

If  you  already  took  a good look at the Australia project, you will have
noticed  that  it  contains  a  large amount of script files.  Personally I
think  scripts  are  the best thing there are when it comes to ASCII-Editor
usage.   You  can  use  them  to  link  ASCII-text  together  or  to create
interesting and amazing Installers...@{ub}

If  you  want to see what Scripting can do for you, just take a look at the
Australia  installer  script.  I know it has been deleted (By the installer
itself,  pretty  clever  if  I may say so!), but there's a duplicate in the
examples scripts directory of ASCII-Edit.  Just load it into an editor like
CED, or use a textviewer that can display texts without responding to ASCII
escape  codes (like dirwork) and read through it.  If you don't get an idea
or two from that...

Oh, yeah, just as clever as the installer, is the opinion poll script, with
the  @{u}cli-menusystem@{uu}  (Menu.script, also included) I'm really proud of!  The
menusystem  was  written  without the need for ASCII-Edit ofcourse, but all
the  rest was created in ASCII-Edit!  Anyway, if you haven't seen it yet...
Go  and  do  it!   NOW!   (and  remember  to  send the results back to us!)

Working  on  this  project  was...   learning more about ASCII, Scripts and
AmigaGuides than I know about working on EP's...

@NODE Guide-Format "The AmigaGuide Format"

@{fg shine}@{b}Amiga Guide@{fg text}

Amiga Guide is so good because it's so incredibly easy to read. Reading a
manual of a large program in AmigaGuide is much easier (and faster) than
reading a loooong ASCII text.@{ub}


Well  you're  reading  one right now, so let's assume you know how it looks
and  what  it  does.  The biggest disadvantage is the amount of colours you
can  use,  namely only 4.  You can use more, but you would probably have to
mess  around  in the palette.prefs, using the Palette program.  Well, these
settings  can  vary with every user, and if you change something, the whole
workbench  looks  like  it  has  been  involved  in  some  kind  of nuclear
experiment.   That's why ASCII-Edit will only save out 4 colours.  That is,
if you used 8 colours in ASCII-Edit to draw the image, only 4 will be saved
(colour  4  remapped to 0, 5 to 1, 6 to 2, and 7 to 3).  I'll tell you
exactly what ASCII-Edit does and does not do in Guide Format.


@{fg shine}@{b}The AmigaGuide Commands@{fg text}

The  format  of  the  AmigaGuide  commands is simple.  Every command always
starts  with  a  \@.  Some commands that have an immediate effect can be put
right after this \@.  But most commands have to be put between { and }.@{ub}

For instance, to change the font to topaz size 8, you type

@{b} @FONT topaz 7@{ub}

And to create a button called Wanda, that links to a node (=page) called
WandaPage, you would type:

@{b} \@{" Wanda " LINK WandaPage}@{ub}


But  I  won't go and explain all that, because ASCII-Edit has nothing to do
with  such  commands!   So,  let's  move  on to something a bit more on the
subject:  @{b}bold@{ub}, @{u}underline@{uu}, @{fg shine}colours@{fg text} and @{bg fill}fieldcolours@{bg back}...

To  make  a word like "Hello" appear on the screen in a bold fontstyle, you
use the b command (Yes!  The b command!), like this:

@{b} \@{b}Hello@{ub}

All  text after \@{b} will be bold, until you turn off bold mode again using
\@{ub} (let's call it unbold...) So if you type:

@{b} \@{b}Hello\@{ub} Hello@{ub}    you will see: @{b}Hello@{ub} Hello


Now,  the same thing goes for underlined mode.  You can use \@{u} to turn it
on, and \@{uu} to turn it off again.  So if you type:

@{b} \@{u}Hello\@{uu} Hello@{ub}    you will see: @{u}Hello@{uu} Hello

And ofcourse, the same goes for Italic, now just use \@{i} and \@{ui}. If
you type:

@{b} \@{i}Hello\@{ui} Hello@{ub}    you will see: @{i}Hello@{ui} Hello



@{fg shine}@{b}Colours@{fg text}

Far  more  interesting are the colours!  You saw the TP-Files.Guide?  Well,
there  you  have  all  the  examples  of  the world of what you can do with
AmigaGuide  in  4 colours...  The colours in the AmigaGuide format all have
their  own  name.  There are eight names (for there are 8 pens available in
but  as  I  said earlier, ASCII-Edit will only use four:@{ub}

  @{b}ASCII-Edit #@{ub}   | @{b}Description@{ub}           | @{b}Default@{ub}   | @{b}AmigaGuide Command@{ub}
  0 (4)          | Background colour     | Grey      | @{bg text}@{fg back}Back@{bg back}@{fg text}
  1 (5)          | Text colour           | Black     | Text
  2 (6)          | Highlight colour      | White     | @{fg shine}Shine@{fg text}
  3 (7)          | Fill colour           | Blue      | @{fg fill}Fill@{fg text}

A  command to change a colour looks like this:  \@{xx yyyy}; xx is either fg
or  bg  for  background or foreground (field or textcolour), yyyy is one of
the above colourcodes.  So, to display the phrase "We're The Problem, Gotta
Love Us!" in white letters, you should type:

 @{b}\@{fg shine}We're The Problem, Gotta Love Us!\@{fg text}@{ub}
If  you leave out the \@{fg text} at the end, all the text that follows will
also  be white, until you change it to another colour.  To display the same
phrase in white text on a blue background, you should enter:

 @{b}\@{fg shine}\@{bg fill}We're The Problem, Gotta Love Us!\@{fg text}\@{bg back}@{ub}

If  you would leave out the \@{bg back} at the end, all following text would
be  on  a blue background.  It couldn't be easier...  Just one more example
to finish it.  If you would want to display this:

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}@{bg text}Gotta@{uu} Love Us!@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

you would have to type in all this:

 @{b}\@{b}\@{u}\@{fg shine}\@{bg text}Gotta\@{uu} Love Us!\@{ub}\@{fg text}\@{bg back}@{ub}



@{i}...mmm, maybe it could have been a bit easier...@{ui} (\@{i}!!!)

@NODE Anim "How to create an ASCII-Animation!"

@{fg shine}@{b}ASCII Animation@{fg text}

Did  you  know  that you too can create an ASCII-Animation without too much
fuzz.   Before  you  read this, first read the pages about ASCII format and
Scripting!@{ub}

Remember the Australia installer? When it started you saw a Problem logo
appearing in vertical columns, from the center of the screen. I will now
fully explain how this was done...


1. Load up ASCII-Edit
2. Select Load from the Tools window, and in the filerequester go to the
   Examples/Projects directory. Then select the file called Logo.Proj
3. Press the Fix button to store the current screen
4. Go in Background mode, select colour 0 (The first one, grey) and
   activate the Draw Box tool. Now draw boxes over the screen to remove
   everything but the three center columns of characters. So, when you're
   done, there's only one verticle bar left, in the center of the screen.
5. Press the Save button and in the Save window, select the ASCII
   fileformat. Set the ASCIISpace cyclegadget to Escape-codes. Now save it as
   Frame1
6. Press the Undo button. You should now have the full logo back on your
   screen.
7. Now remove the centre column you saved in step 5, and leave everything
   else on screen.
8. Press Fix to store this screen.
9. Now again remove everything from screen, except for three columns to the
   right of the center columns you removed before, and three columns at the
   left of it. So, when you're done, all that's left are two columns, with an
   empty space between them
10. Press Save again and Save it as Frame2
11. Press Undo. Now you should have the full loge back on screen, but
    with some columns missing in the middle (fixed in step 8).
12. Remove the columns you just saved (to the left and right of the center)
    and press Fix.
13. Repeat from step 9 until you have reached the outer left and right limits
    of the logo. The last frame you save is an almost empty screen with only
    the utmost left, and utmost right columns of the logo.
14. Quit ASCII-Edit. Yes Really...


15. Load a Text Editor a la CED that can handle escapecodes.
16. Load  Frame1
17. Move the cursor to the bottom of the text.
18. If you're in CED, press ESC and the [, then 0 and then H (capital, you
    know with Shift) so you see @{fg back}@{bg text}[@{fg text}@{bg back}[0H
19. Select Include File from the menu and load Frame2.
20. Repeat  from  step  17  until  all  frames are in and then save it as
    Logo.ASCII


21. Clear the screen and type this:

SETFONT topaz 8
TYPE Logo.ASCII

Save it as Logo.ANIM in the same directory as the Logo.ASCII file Make sure
that an Icon is saved with the file (CED:  turn on Icon Creation)

22.   Leave  the  editor  to  return to Workbench.  Now go to the directory
where  you  saved  Logo.Anim  and  look  for it's icon and press it ONES to
select  it.  From the Icon menu, select Information.  Now enter this in the
Tool Types area:

@{b} WINDOW=CON:0/0/640/256/Logo@{ub}


and in the Default Tool area:

@{b} IconX@{ub}

and the press save.


23.   Double  click the icon and if all went well, you should be looking at
an  animated  logo,  appearing  from  the center outwards...  If it doesn't
work, load the Logo.ASCII file in the editor and look for errors.

@NODE Bugs "Bugs"

@{fg shine}@{b}Bugs In ASCII-Edit?@{fg text}

ASCII-Edit has no real bugs in it, but there are some inconveniences.

1. Redraw@{ub}
Everytime  you press a slidergadget, the entire screen redraws itself, even
if  you  didn't  move  the  slider.  I could tell you that this is an extra
feature  of  ASCII-Edit  in  that  you have two extra Redraw Buttons, but I
won't.

@NODE LoadGuide "How to load a node"

@{fg shine}@{b}Loading Guides...@{fg text}

ASCII-Edit  can load in a node from an AmigaGuide file.  If you selected an
AmigaGuide  from  the Load filerequester, you will see a window pop up.  In
the window are the following things:


List-o-nodes@{ub}

In  the  listviewer  area  you  will  see  a  list  of all the nodes in the
AmigaGuide file.  If you want to read one, simply click on it's name in the
list.   In  the background you will see a text-only version (no colours, no
fontstyles  etc.)  This  way  you can search for the node you would like to
load.

@{b}Textfields@{ub}
Next  to  the  list,  are  two  textgadgets.   The top one will display the
selected  node.   The  bottom one shows the real title of the node (the one
between " and " in the nodes title).


@{b}Front&Back Cyclegadget@{ub}

Use  the  cyclegadget  to  select  what  you  want  to load.  If you select
"Front&Back"  ASCII-Edit  will  load  the  complete  node and all on-screen
information  will be lost because the projects' size will be adapted to the
size  of the node, so remember that.  If you select Front or Back then only
that  information  will  be inserted into the current project.  The size of
the project will not be changed, so set it up properly first.


@{b}Load New Button@{ub}

Use  this  to  bring up a filerequester which you can use to select another
guide.


@{b}PREV and NEXT buttons@{ub}

Press  one  of  these  to  select the following or the previous item in the
list.


@{b}Load Selected Button@{ub}

Pressing  this, will get ASCII-Edit to load in the selected node, and close
the "Load Guide" window.


@{b}The Cancel Button@{ub}

Pressing  this,  will  get ASCII-Edit not to load in the selected node, and
then close the "Load Guide" window.
