@{b}Read this first!@{ub}

Dear user,

This  EP  is  the result of 5 months of unpaid hard-labour, piles of bugles
and  was  finished  in  spite  of  constant  nagging  parents,  neighbours,
police-officers and the german lederhosen music from nextdoor.

We  used  up  10 pencils, 3 mousemats and 2 mice (one mechanical and a live
one.  (The poor animal died because of the stress)) 1 Samsung stereo set is
nearly  gone  (man, they wear off quickely!).  15 disks were also killed in
the  creational  process.   Two  members left and one is still missing (but
alive).   97 litres of coke, 300 cups of coffee and 80 bags of Bugles.  One
member  was  mutilated beyond recognision because he fell of his bike while
going  over  the latest changes in the EP.  The doctor went on a holiday to
the  Bahama's...We  spent  351  guilders  on overhead costs.  (Like stamps,
disks,  mice,  mats,  phonebills  etc.).  We wasted 30 MB of perfectly good
harddisk  space.   The  install-script  was  run (for testing purposes) for
about  50 times.  (So you can trust it!) We tested at least 20 programs for
use in creating and (dis-)playing the EP.  (Like modplayers, paintpackages,
packers,  shells  etc.)  Some  of us had to spend time at the psychiatrist.

All the above is actually true. We put a lot of time and money in this
effort and it is brought to you free of charge.

If you like this EP, please:
@{b}
-fill in the Opinion Poll!!!

-send us any amount of money you think is appropriate
@{ub}
You  are not obliged to send @{"us" LINK TP-Files.guide/contact} anything, but we are just poor students who
are very curious to know what you think about their handiwork.  The Problem
is  not  and  never will be a commercial institution, but we spent a lot of
money  on this release and therefore we'd appreciate that when you use this
EP  you  send us some money to cover our expenses.  Perhaps there will even
be a small surprise for you if you do.

@NODE What "Australia.Guide:What"
@{b}What in the world is this thing?@{ub}

Well, let's just assume that you don't know.  If that is true, then why did
you  download  or  buy it?  It's an awfully big "thing" and therefore quite
expensive.  OK, we'll give explaining a go anyway!

The Australia EP is basically an attempt by The Problem to get better known
in  the  Amiga  community.   By  using  it  you  participate  in  a baleful
advertising scheme and....

@{i}Hey! Isn't this @{"the SM EP" LINK TP-Files.Guide/SMEP} all over again?
@{ui}

Mmmm, we hadn't thought about it in that way yet! Let's just check....
NO! No! no! Well, eeuh a bit...

Really,  what we hope to bring to you with this release is 2.8 megabytes of
digital  interactive  (who  ever  thought  came up with that term should be
first  against  the  wall when the revolution comes!) entertainment to last
for  quite  some  while.   Perhaps it would be best if you saved the EP for
those long winter evening when normal people sit arond the fireplace with a
cup of hot choco...

@{b}History@{ub}
The  continent  of Australia was the discovered by the Dutchman Abel Tasman
in  1606.   A long time after that the englishman James Cook took possesion
of  the southeast coast for Great Brittain.  It was used in those days as a
colony for criminals.  Prisoners were sent to Australia until 1868.  During
that  time  large  part  of  Australia  had  become  the  terrain  of  free
colonisation.  These colonists, often ex-convicts, colonized for themselves
instead  of for Queen and country.  They lived by herding sheep and growing
corn.   It  wasn't until 1901 that all those seperate "colonies" became one
under  the  Commonwealth of Australia.  Because of it's remote position, it
could  not count on english troops for protection, so it had to protect its
self.   Large  amounts  of troops where sent into WW II, with heavy losses.
Eventhough  a  Japanese  invasion  of  Australia  was  expected, this never
happened.   After  the  war, Australia became the place to immigrate to and
that  caused  the population the grow explosively.  All this time Australia
remained  loyal  to  the  brittish  commonwealth.   One  black  page out of
Australia's  history  is  the way they treated the aborigines, the original
inhabitants.  (They came in from Asia about 20.000 years ago) The colonists
accused  them  of all sorts of crimes, like murdering children (this can be
explain because many nomadic tribe do this when there is lack of food.  The
survival of the tribe comes first) and were therefore persecuted and driven
from  the  fertile land into the desert (like the bushmen in South Africa).
From  the  original 300.000, there are nowadays less then 75.000 aborigines
left.  Many died because of the harsh climate in the desert.  Now they live
in the cities and in reservations.

@{b}Landscape@{ub}
In  the  east  there  are  mountains, called the Great Dividing Range, that
descend  to a coast of changing wideness.  Lots of rivers flow through them
to  the  ocean.   The highest peak is Mount Kosciusko (2230 m) in the Snowy
Mountains.   The  rest  of  the  country  is mainly lowland with three main
basins.   There  is  the Carpentia Basin, Murray-Darling Basin and ofcourse
Eyre  Basin,  with it's famous Lake Eyre.  It is one of the dryest spots on
earth  and  is  mostly taken up by sanddeserts like the Simpson Desert.  An
equally  famous place is the Ayers Rock, which is a holy place the original
inhabitants  of Australia, the aborigines.  In the southeast the climate is
less  harsh  and  is  therefore a place where almost al major cities can be
found.   There  isn't  much  flora and fauna and it lacks almost all higher
species of animal.  Notable though are ofcourse the Kangaroo, the Coala and
the  platypus.   Because  of  its  isolated place, flora and fauna are very
distinct from other countries.

@{b}Economy@{ub}
The  main  part  of Australia's export is taken up by agricultural products
and   cattle.    58%  of  the  land  is  used  for  either  argiculture  or
cattle-growing.  The main crop is grain which is grown on 50% of the usable
land  which is mostly in West and South Australia, Victoria New South Wales
and  Queensland.   Sheep  (ofcourse)  are the main source of income for the
cattlefarmers.   Australia has the largest sheepstock in the world.  Mining
is  also  a very profitable industry:  gold, copper, lead, iron and uranium
are  just some of the materials that are mined.  Also oil and gas are being
won out of several fields. This is not only used for local needs but it
also exported to Japan for example.

@NODE Fastview "FastView: Introduction"

FastView  is  a program which shows IFF, GIF, BMP, PCX and JPEG pictures on
your  screen.  Of course many programs exist for this task, but this one is
special  because it is very fast and was designed with both OCS/ECS and AGA
users  in mind.  For example:  FastView can show HAM8 and IFF24Bit pictures
on  OCS/ECS machines in HAM which was one of the things I missed in all the
other viewing-programs I've seen.

JPEG pictures are shown using the Tower JPEG Codec Class by Christoph Feck.
