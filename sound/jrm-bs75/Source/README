Building the source code
========================
- SAS C 6.5x is required.
- To build, run 'smake'.
- To clean the build directory, run 'smake clean'.

General
=======
- Conversion of data files to object files can be done for example using
  the Bin2Hunk tool (http://aminet.net/package/dev/misc/Bin2Hunk).
    - To convert the data, run 'Bin2Hunk data.raw data.o NAME _name HUNK data',
      modifying the data name, hunk name and memory type as necessary.

Graphics
========
- The graphics other than the opponent bikes and roadside objects are RAW
  files converted to object files.
    - These graphics can be converted to RAW files using any RAW converter.
- The opponent bike and roadside object graphics are RAW files bundled into
  blitter object bundles.
    - The format of these are defined by the BobBundleHeader and BobHeader
      structures.
    - After these structures the bundle contains RAW image data.
    - The bundles are converted into BitmapObject classes by the BitmapObject
      constructor.
    - The bundles can be generated using the provided BobBundleGenerator tool.
        - The tool requires Qt to build.
        - To build the tool, run 'qmake' and 'make'.
        - To convert the graphics, run
          './BobBundleGenerator image.png image.bobbundle'.
- The provided ImageRipper tool can be used to find images from ROM dump files.
    - The tool requires Qt to build.
    - To build the tool, run 'qmake' and 'make'.
    - To run the tool, run './ImageRipper rom1.bin rom2.bin'.
        - The second argument is optional. If provided, bytes from the provided
          files are interleaved with each other.
        - Use the offset selector to choose the byte offset to show image data
          from.
        - Use the bits per pixel selector to choose bits per pixel. Only 1, 2,
          4 and 8 produce valid results.
        - Use the width, height and modulo selectors until the expected image
          is visible.
        - Type an output filename (output.png) and choose Save from the File
          menu to save the image.

Sound
=====
- The sound is a MOD file converted to TrackerPacker v3.1 format and then to
  two object files.
