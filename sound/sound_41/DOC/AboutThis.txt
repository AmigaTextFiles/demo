 Note about being system friendly :

 Sound as a whole is both system friendly, and supports multi-
 tasking, friendly exiting etc...

 BUT : Since some of the modules can only be played correct
 with 'Tracker Packer V3', There is a 'slight' problem using
 Protracker after a Sound session..
 This is partly because of Tracker Packers handling of the CIA
 timing interrupt, and partly because of PT's handlig of the same..
 This is unfortunate, but cannot be helped..
 Some of the musicians have a very interesting ability to demon-
 strate the remaining flaws in the various replayers ;)
 I will especially mention MAZ, as he seems to do thing with the
 loop commands (E6x) that nobody seemed possible (atleast neither
 Guru/S2 (P61) or Merge/Polka B. (ProSucker))..


This  program has  been written entirely in 'C' except for the 
following :
       The Decruncher (RNC V2.08 (mode 2))
       The Replayers  (The Player V6.1A)
                      (Tracker Packer V3.1)
        
The source for Sound 3 is divided into these modules :
 Main.c :
                Opens global stuff, calls GFX routines, etc...
                Portable to any C-compiler (& therefor compu-
                ter :) )
                There is some native (Amiga-OS) stuff in this, 
                but this will be  fairly  easy to port (I hope
                /suspect :)

 FileSupport.c :
                This is an abstractionlayer for IO routines,
                So the main program has an easy way to load 
                files into the correct memory...
                Making it a little easier to port..
                This also handles the XPK interfaceing

 GFXSupport.c :
                Implementation specific graphics routines..
                Currently 1 version :
                 One for Native AGA Amiga's
                 This allocates screens, loads, and  decrunches 
                 screen data, and handles gadgets etc..


 IntroSequence.c :
                This runs the  Spoon  intro sequence, ie. shows 
                some nice pictures. (Amiga-OS dependant)

 OnBoardGFX.c :
                This contains the 'onboard' graphics, gadgets 
                and stuff, which is too small to deserve sepa-
                rate loading.. (more or less Amiga Dependant ;)


 TIGFX.c :
                More onboard gfx...

 HL_GFX.c:
                Even more onboard gfx... ;)

 Texts.c :
                This  contains  ModuleInfo's, Rules text,  and 
                the dreaded Editorial...
                I don't  change this  so often, so it's better 
                to leave it  in a separate file, and save com-
                pilation time..

 ReplayerStub.c :
                This module interfaces Sound #4 to the 2 dif-
                ferent replayers that we use...

 P612.o :
                This is a version of The Player V6.1 by Guru / 
                Sahara Surfers adapted to work with C programs 
                (Parameter calls etc..) (Amiga dep....)
                For all you rippers out there (HI ;)
                This is The Player V610.2 !! 

 TP3.o :
                This is Tracker Packer V3.1 by Crazy Crack..
                I was forced to include this extra replayer,
                when I found out that P612 didn't handle the
                Pattern Loop (E6X) as good as I wanted...

 Amongst  the response to Sound #1, several  people  (swappers 
 mostly) have complained  that  Sound wasn't a 'one file' pro-
 gram, but that would be a real pain in the ***!!!
 I would have to make it either with overlays, since it  isn't 
 feasible to load ALL of the stuff (300Kb gfx & 500 Kb msx) at 
 once  AND leave space for  buffers,  spare screens etc... and 
 frankly, I know zilch about overlays..
 Or make it as 2 files..
 A main program and one large datafile, like  some diskmags do 
 it...  I have thought about this, but I find it  much  easier 
 to do it with my current system of separate files...

 Actually, as this program grows and grows, it has rapidly grown
 to a size that simply won't fit one DD disk, and therefor I
 consider the debate of onefile (and disk) closed.... ;)

 There is also the reason that I am quite happy with my current
 disk system which makes it easy for me to do HD install, and
 I can't be bothered to write a whole new setup .....

 The response to Sound #2 has also made us change quite a lot
 inside the program :

 Among the big changes is the handling of the Extra screens
 It is now handled from one general screen, with a set of gadgets
 and a 'mutal exclude' system...
 Since the standard Gadget code in intuition.library doesn't quite
 support this, I have had to make my own...
 This takes quite some hopes, and knocking on wood's to make it
 work, but it seems to do so :)
 This became even more knocking on wood, when I implemented the
 text printing, which has to handle which text to plot, which
 page of it, and if there is more pages etc.. etc...

 Still some people have asked for lesser files in Sound :
 Keep on dreaming pals...
 I have thought about using a similar system to the Diskmag ROM,
 but it would have to be a 3-file system :
  Main, Disk1File, Disk2File, and I much prefer my own layout..

 Another (small) addition, are the socalled 'file_id.diz' files..
 These are small identification marks, used for BBS'es, and the
 only reason they weren't present in Sound 2, was that due to
 some delay's I was forced to rush the delivery of the final version
 and forgot some small files. (hd-installer included ;)
 Now thanx to Slurry/Black Fishy, we have a nice File_ID.DIZ to
 use, with  a (more or less) readable ansii layout...
 Many thank you's for that Slurry !!!

 Some people have suggested that we should include some 'flashy' code,
 to make this look more like music disks such as 'Mirror' and 'JesterDay'
 For the moment, this will NOT be done, since the concept behind
 Sound is more like some of the DiskMags, mmeaning this is a general
 Music disk, with a small HitList, and NOT a full fledged Spoon-
 Music Disk, and therefor we do not intend to do the extra work, that
 it would require to include some flashy code every issue !!
 The long time goal for Sound, is to release an issue every 2 months
 so the overhead needed for new flashy code every issue would make my
 (the coder's) life a nightmare....
 The Flashy code should come with the intro which b.t.w is something
 any group can contribute to...
 If you want your intro on Sound, then contact either CDLQ or SHAYERA
 with a rough outline of your intro, and we will contact you stating
 if we accept it, and for which issue of Sound it would appear
 (The last so your GFX can reflect this..)
 We would appreciate it if the intro mentions Sound and Spoon, but
 we wont accept intro's that slags neither Spoon nor other sceners !!


 Amongst the responce to Sound #3 has been :

 The HD-Install script forgets the fonts.. FIXED
 It is impossible to use ProTracker after viewing Sound..
  This is because of the lousy IRQ setup in TrackerPacker..
  I hope to have this fixed before the release of Sound #4

 Some musicians have been concerned that I use P61 for replaying
 since they fear that it destroys the samples...
 REST EASY.. I do not use the sample packing (the 4 bit delta)
 I use the pattern packing and the 8 bit delta encoding, and this
 does NOT change the sound !!!


 Sound #4 is developed on the following configuration :

 Coders machine :
  Commodore Amiga A1200, 2Mb Chip memory, AGA chipset
  Microbotics MBX1200z, 4Mb Fast Memory, 14MHz 68881
  Kickstart V 3.0 (39.106)
  Workbench V 3.0 (39.29)
  X-tra diskdrive,of suspect manufacturing:) (6 years/no err's)
  Quantum Prodrive ELP120 120 Mb 3½" HD

 Main responsible person's (and gfx'ers) machine :
  Commodore Amiga A1200, 2Mb Chip memory, AGA chipset
  Kickstart V 3.0 (39.106)
  Workbench V 3.0 (39.29)
  X-tra diskdrive

 As you can see, Amiga developers doesn't neccessarily have to have
 exotic machines to do proper work :)

 Tested on :
  A1200, No FastRam, Kick 3
  A1200, 2 Mb Chip, 4 Mb FastRam, Kick 3
  A4030, 2 Mb Chip, 4 Mb Fast, Kick 3 (Thanx Bagger)
  A4030, 2 Mb Chip, A lot of Fast, Kick 3 (Thanx to Subacid)
  A4040, 2 Mb Chip, A lot of Fast, Kick 3 (Thanx to Silents DK)

 Tools used in the creation of Sound #4 so far :

 SAS/C Amiga C/C++ compiler V6.55
  (I hope SAS Institure reconsiders their dropping the Amiga..
   it will be irritating to port this to eg. Maxon C/C++ 3)

 Cygnussoft CED 3.5
  (Miles beyond SAS/C's SE editor :)

 HiSoft Devpac Amiga Assembler V3.04
  (The best for serious system programming)

 Electronic Arts Deluxe Paint V4.5 (AGA)
  (It's old, It's slow, but it is trustworthy :)

 Cloanto's Personal Paint V6
  (Why can't DPaint use Sound's legal system font ??)

 PicCon V2.5 (Registered Version :)
  (This program is REALLY great, go out and register it today)

 ExoticRipper V2.29 (Registered)

 ProPack 2.08 by Rob Northen Computing

 The Player V6.1A (610.2) -  22.05.95 by Guru / Sahara Surfers
  (The best for both speedy replay, and good diskspace saving)

 TrackerPacker V3.1 by Crazy Crack.
  Not as good in the space saving, but it supports 2 commands
  that The Player doesn't ...

 Directory Opus V4.12 by Innovatronics
  (I've tried V5... Therefor I use V4 ;)

 ImageFX V2.1 by Nova Design Inc.
  This is a VERY smart Image Manipulation package...

 The XPK Compression package..
  Gives me a few much needed extra bytes of diskspace ;)

 Special Hardware used :

 Commodore Amiga CD32+FMV,
  to keep my mind distracted while I work :)

 Special thanks so far :

 Advert :

 If you are an official representative from a software company 
 seeking  new employees, then I can be contacted  at the above 
 address... I am fluent in 68K Assembler, and 'C', and,as this 
 program shows,I am not afraid of working in big projects with 
 modular builds.  This  has  been a good excercise in managing 
 such a project,and I feel pretty confident about my abilities 
 when it comes to coding on the Commodore Amiga series of mini 
 computers.  I  have  also  some  experience  in   coding  the 
 Commodore  64, but this is probably  not  of any significance 
 here in 1995 :)
 I have a solid foundation in 'system progamming' as Sound 3
 shows, and I am also known for being a very fast learner.
 This means that I am willing to work on eg. Intel or PowerPC
 based systems, but as I haven't got such a system myself, I
 would have to need a small period of time to learn it, but
 I would be willing to do this, as long as I don't have to have
 too much to do with Windows !! (I would much prefer OS/2 WARP)


  1995, the revolution is coming...
