  Locked master revision at 1.00

Next update will be Sound3 1.xx

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 8.3.1995 by John Hinge :

Well, I really thought this was locked, but while waiting for a (MUCH)
delayed intro, I could brush up a few minor details :

* Buttons.ASM : REMOVED, I much prefer using 'C' everywhere :)

Main.c : 1.01
* added two BOOLs reflecting mousebuttonstate

GFXSupport.c : 1.01
* all decrunchs now done via GFXDecrunch(), this saves space, and ensures
  uniform response to decrunch errors

GFXSupport.c : 1.02
* now fully cleans up, and makes meaningfull requesters informing of
  eventual error conditions, however, in the case of a severe error,
  I can't always guarantee a stable machine

REV.c : 1.01
  Bumped master revision to 1.01
;------------------------------------------
Changes at 14.3.1995 by John Hinge :

IntroSequence.c : 1.05
+ Added exitfunction to IntroSequence.. Just Hold LMB a little while

Main.c : 1.02
* changed the sign on text a little, added releasedate

 SOUND 2 is locked at this revision level...
 next update will be Sound 3 !!

 Forthcoming features :
 Running better on GFX cards, at the moment it can be MADE to run
 more or less (mostly less) smoothly on Retina blt Z3
 This will not be easy, but if it can be done, then this proggy will
 be real hot, as the mods will enable it to run on most major GFX cards
 (under their relevant Emulators !!)

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 20.04.1995 by John Hinge :

Here we go again : Project renamed to Sound 3, all files updated to
reflect this, new compile of GST, and numerous minor details...

GFXSupport.c : 1.04
* changed return to mainscreen functions a little, to make it more
  logical for the user.. Suggested by : Various

GFXSupport.c : 1.05
* Begun changes in GFX layout :
  New MainScreen is up (neat..)
  New BackGround on Info and RulesScreen.. (Too bad RulesScreen is going ...
   (although the replacement will be nice...)
;------------------------------------------
Changes at 21.04.1995 by John Hinge :

MainScreen changed, Empty GadgetBoxes added, for nice visual cues
P61.O : 
* Update to 610.1 / 19.03.1995
  As always, quite a mess to do, since ASM-One wasn't made for easy
  creation of code interfacing to anything (Why can't I decide the section
  names without loosing my XDEF's ???)
  (Now I atleast have made a 'skeleton' to bang up the new revisions
   of the replayer on...)
;------------------------------------------
Changes at 22.04.1995 by John Hinge :

GFXSupport.c : 1.06
* Changed Wipes a little, to improve speed
* Added new Variable : DecrunchedImage...
  Saves me from decrunching an already decrunched image (i.e. SPEED)

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 23.04.1995 by John Hinge :

GFXSupport.c : 1.07
+ Now decrunches MainScreen and BackGround Image one time, into 2 spare
  bitmaps, to enhance the speed...
  This ofcourse means a higher cost of memory, but....
* DecrunchedImage changed to CurrentImage, since there is no decrunching
  when The proggy is running, only at init time..
* Uses CopyMem instead of GFXDecrunch...
  This is 'slightly' faster :)

OnBoardGfx.c : 1.01
+ Added the small ball gadgets

GFXSupport.c : 1.08
+ Added the nice new gadgets to InfoScreen

OnboardGFX.c : 1.02
+ Added the InfoScreen Gadgets
* Removed the stand alone ball images, since they tended to blast
  a small square hole in the screen :)
  replaced with images including the background to avoid such small
  embarrasments ;)
;------------------------------------------
Changes at 24.04.1995 by John Hinge :

GFXSupport.c : 1.09
+ Added small font

Main.c : 1.03
+ Added small font to initialization

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 25.04.1995 by John Hinge :

GFXSupport.c : 1.10
! Added 'mutual exlude' gadget set for InfoScreen
! Added logics for 'mutual exclude'
 ( Mutual Exclude, means that I (hopefully) knows which text
   screen I am plotting, and which gadget, that can not be activated)

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 27.04.1995 by John Hinge :

Main.c : 1.04
* Changed some filenames I had 'forgot'.. ;)

GFXSupport.c : 1.12

* Changed Wipe handling, since InfoScreen doesn't need the big
  wipe when changing between the texts !!

* InfoScreen now prints various texts with the small font
  Currently only ModInfos and Laws implemented...

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 08.05.1995 by John Hinge :

+ New file : TIGFX.c,o,h
  This file contains struct image's for the tekst indicator arrows
  They are here because OnboardGFX.c got crowded ;)

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 23.05.1995 by John Hinge :

Main.c : 1.05
* Added call to GFXLowlevelIRQ
  a routine for doing stuff that doesn't need to be on the 'real' IRQ

GFXSupport.c : 1.16
* Added GFXLowlevelIRQ routine
  Currently this handles the 'zooming' arrows for the pageshifter
;------------------------------------------

GFXSupport.c : 1.17
* Implemented Arrow-Indicator system
* Implemented Pageshifting on Extrascreen

GFXSupport.c : 1.18

  apparently adding the pageshifter wasn't just 'a piece of cake' ;)

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 29.05.1995 by John Hinge :

OnboardGFX.c : 1.03
* Added the last 2 gadgets for ExtraScreen (MainScreen+HitList)

GFXSupport.c : 1.19

;------------------------------------------

 All modules :
 Changed FileSupport to use shayera.library (Support lib)

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 05.06.1995 by John Hinge :
 All modules :
  Decruncher moved to shayera.library
  Calls changed to reflect this
;------------------------------------------
Changes at 13.06.1995 by John Hinge :
 All modules :
  Dropped using shayera.library for the time being, as
  using it makes it harder to port...

IntroSequence.c : 1.06
* Added Head sequence (very trance like..)
;------------------------------------------
Changes at 16.06.1995 by John Hinge :

Main.c : 1.06
 Cleanup, and documenting of some of the weird stuff in the code..

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 18.06.1995 by John Hinge :

IntroSequence.c : 1.07
* Now all the GFX is up and running...

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 17.07.1995 by John Hinge : (summer has come and gone ;)

P612.asm|.o :
* Now the devpac version of the replayer is back (WHOOPIE)
* It seems Jarno is back on track....
* An this means I don't have to make weird happenings with Asm-One

Main.c : 1.07
* since the replayer now is a major source amongst the others,
* some changes were made here and there ....

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 31.07.1995 by John Hinge :

IntroSequence.c : 1.08
* CDLQ requested that the Head sequence shouldn't 'blank' between
  the different heads... so there...

Texts.c : 1.06
* Added Sound Surfer Society texts...

GFXSupport.c : 1.20
* Added Surfer Society text to InfoScreen....

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 10.08.1995 by John Hinge :
Texts.c : 1.07
* Added all the new mod info's
* changed text layout for modinfo's since CDLQ insists
* that Ramosa's should have 2 pages (GRRRRRR !!!)
* If this fucker works.. I am happy indeed
* Added Editorial text

GFXSupport.c : 1.21
* Incorporated the new ModInfo texts via the just as new
* ModInfo structure...
* Apparently much of that code had been done already...
* (Sometimes I amaze even myself ;)
* When I did the pageselect stuff 4 the other texts, I apparently
* foresaw the need for several pages in the ModInfos...

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 12.08.1995 by John Hinge :
GFXSupport.c : 1.22
* Updating of Selector Images....

;------------------------------------------
From 12.08 -> 2x.08 :
Very irritating bughunt....
A VERY sneaky error has been introduced into the gadget system
for the InfoScreen.. This has sofar taken VERY much time to find..

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 28.08.1995 by John Hinge :
Change of Compiler to SAS/C 6.55...
thx must go to SubAcid for supplying the Update...
NOTE: This is not an illegal update (pirates beware..)
I (as opposed to many others) am a registered user of SAS/C
(and much poorer for that ;)

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 12.09.1995 by John Hinge :
GFXSupport.c : 1.30
I finally tracked down the bugger :
It seems that my Gadget structures somehow looses the contents of
the Flags variable, and this must then be put in before
the calling of AddGList() and RefreshGList(), but then
everything works.... (This HAS to be an OS error, so I wonder if
 Amiga Technologies know about it, and if so, will they fix it ??..
 Sofar nobody has fixed the bug in the 'FileSystem' which allows
 disk to go very corupt and NOT be able to validate them...)
 (It happens when the OS wants to validate the disk, but there is
  no free block to write the new bitmap BEFORE deleting the old !!
  Then the OS just gives up INSTEAD of writing the new IN TOP OF the old)
;------------------------------------------
Changes at 20.9.1995 by John Hinge :
Added special functions for the HitList selector :
It now displays the name of the runner ups, when you press the
modulenames.. This was a real bugger to install

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 12.10.1995 by John Hinge :
 WELL, WELL, WELL
It seems that The Player V6.1 (610.2) has a slight bug :
E6x (Pattern loop) goes bonkers sometimes, so I was forced to
bolt on another replayer, meaning that Sound now has 2 onboard
replayers :
  The Player V6.1 (610.2)
  Tracker Packer V3.1
That took a little sorting out, and a new file : ReplayerStub.c

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 22.10.1995 by John Hinge :
 Replaced two modules with new versions, since they used 'illegal'
 effect commands..
 Changed some strings to make this a Release version..
 Sound #3 is now Finished (I Hope)
;------------------------------------------
Changes at 26.10.1995 by John Hinge :
 FileSupport.c :
 Changed to use XPK
 This means that I can pack all modules with
 xpk, and still use the same LoadFile() call
 to load everything....

To Do :
 It looks like The Player has to go..
 It creates LOTS of enforcer hits (read hits only ;)
 when initing, and therefor it has to go..
 Fortunately I have installed XPK support, so
 now I can use Tracker Packer, and still gain diskspace....

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 07.11.1995 by John Hinge :
GFXSupport.c : 1.31
 Changed strings to Sound 4
 Inserted new palette

Main.c : 1.08
 Changed strings to Sound 4

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 12.11.1995 by John Hinge :
Floppies now reflects the status as Sound 4

;------------------------------------------

HDInstall :
 Cleaned up.
 Built in copying of the fonts (whoups)
 and the XPK stuff
 Also added a check for the needed free diskspace

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 29.11.1995 by John Hinge :
OnboardGFX.c : 1.04
 Inserted the new ball shape images
GFXSupport.c :
 Moved gadgets around...

;------------------------------------------
Changes at 27.12.95/28.12.1995 by John Hinge :
Hectic work at The Party V, 1995...
added new text page on infoscreen, did new
introsequence, etc., etc. 
;------------------------------------------
