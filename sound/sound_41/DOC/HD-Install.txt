 How to Install Sound to a Harddisk :

 You have 2 options :
 You can use the included script for the 'Installer' utility..
 But this utility is NOT included since it is a copyrighted
 piece of sowftware, and for the moment I don't know whether my
 old license for both AmigaGuide and Installer is still valid...
 (YO Escom/Amiga Technologies : Are our licenses valid ???)

 Or, if you don't have 'Installer' you can do it by hand :

 Basically it is very simple to install Sound to a Harddisk,
 since all you need to do, is copy everything except the
 normal system stuff to a directory :
 Everything means everything except : s/#? libs/#? c/#? devs/#? etc..
 Then you should have a directory containing the following :
 A directory called GFX,
 A directory called FONTS,
 A directory called MSX,
 A directory called DOC,

 If you don't have XPK installed the you should also copy the
 xpkmaster.libray and the compressors dir to your LIBS: dir

 If you have XPK installed, then check the compressors in the
 libs/compressors against those I use, and update if neccessary..
 
 Also copy a couple of files, including a file called Sound4 ;)
 There is NO need for special assigns, just stand in the dir
 which you've made and enter : Sound4 <return>
 And then all should be clear....
 You don't have to copy the intro from the disks, but since
 the group involved has worked hard on it, you really should
 consider it, at the very least look at it ???

 That's it and that's that....
