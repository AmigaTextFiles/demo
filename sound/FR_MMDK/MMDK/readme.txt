I finally found time to do my first upload:

Federal Robotics    "Mental Machinery Demi-Klops"

This collection of tracks exists since December 1997.
It consists of some StoneTracker executables I have done.
It has a DOS menu (I am no coder, sorry!) for easy access
and sounds great on "plain" A1200, too (thanks to the
excellent StoneTracker).

Any reaction is welcome (TobyStag@aol.com).
