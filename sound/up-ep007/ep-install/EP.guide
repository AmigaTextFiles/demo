@{bg shine} introdukktion@{bg back}


 see... we were kinda bored by our current group, three little elks, so
 me (@{b}spot@{ub}) together with @{b}blade@{ub}, @{b}plus8@{ub} and @{b}skope@{ub}, made @{b}up@{ub} our cloudy minds
 and formed this fly crew "@{b}up rough soundsystem@{ub}".
 the idea was to kinda play it kool and release @{i}lotsa@{ui} moosik.
 most coders are so lazy nowadays anyway (Nem: "Ouch...that hurts" ;), so
 tryin' to kick as a demokru just ain't fun enuff.

-so whas'nu'bout that? there's already loadsa kru's doin' just that!

-yea... is it?

 see, they just release lame @{i}lha-lzx-zip-rar-arj-suckdick-whatever@{ui} packs.
 most of the kru's are also movin' towards the hitech bitch scene,
 releasin' cd's and mp3's and pc-shit n'n'and...  stuff! @{b}fuck them!@{ub}

 @{b}let's get real@{ub} and bring that feelin' back!

                                                                    /@{i}spot@{ui}

 you should @{b}always@{ub} use the install script to install/update the @{b}ep@{ub}

 install script doesn't work for some reason...here's how to do it
 yaself...

 @{fg shine}1@{fg text} make a dir called uprough (or somethang) somewhere on ya drive.

   (skip if u have a previous installation...)

 @{fg shine}2@{fg text} copy the files ep, ep.guide, eplogo.up, eplogopal.up,
   prefs, prefsmui and start to the directory.

   (@{b}important@{ub}: if ya got a previous installation, check the
   version of ep, ep.guide, prefs, prefsmui and start before ya copy 'em.
   @{b}always@{ub} use the @{b}latest version@{ub} of these files!)

 @{fg shine}3@{fg text} copy the icons ya wanna use from the icons/ directory.

 @{fg shine}4@{fg text} copy the ep:s ya wanna install from the eps/ directory.

 @{fg shine}5@{fg text} if ya want you can add the lines:

   ;begin ep
   assign ep: "<the directory u chose in 1.>"
   ;end   ep

   to your user-startup. but they @{b}ain't@{ub} needed if ya use the
   scripts to start da ep's.

 @{fg shine}6@{fg text} done!

@{bg shine} questions@{bg back}



    @{fg shine}when i press the "screenmode" gadget a error message appears saying@{uu}
    somethang bout no modes available...whats the deal with that?@{fg text}

    ep simply couldn't find any screenmode(s) that was suitable to run on.
    (ie a screenmode with a size greater or equal to 640x480x6.)

    aga users: make sure that yuh have executed setpatch!

    @{fg shine}why doesnt the screenmode requester show any cybergraphics modes when i
    boot without startup-sequence?@{fg text}

    because cybergraphics isn't running! copy envarc:cybergraphx to
    env:cybergraphx. and run ya monitor file from devs:monitors/.

    @{fg shine}when i run the prefs window in mui mode a message appears saying
    "couldn't open muimaster.library v11+"...now what?@{fg text}

    make sure u've got mui version 3.0 or better (newest atm is 3.8). if u
    run withpout starup-sequence, make sure mui: is assigned to its proper
    place and that yuh've assigned "assign libs: mui:libs add".

    @{fg shine}i think the doll flickers when it crossfades if i've got direct cgx on.@{fg text}

    well, this is because only 1/4 of the "crossfade cgx" is updated at a
    time. when no direct cgx is used, this is made in a buffer and when the
    4:th update is done the buffer is written to the screen. on direct cgx
    the gfx is written pixel for pixel when it's processed.

    @{fg shine}seems like i ain't got enuff memory, what can i do to save some...?@{fg text}

    @{fg shine}C@{fg text} boot without startup-sequence.
    @{fg shine}C@{fg text} disable all partitions not needed.
    @{fg shine}C@{fg text} decrease the buffers for the partition(s) with addbuffers.
    @{fg shine}C@{fg text} disable the effect and the intro.
    @{fg shine}C@{fg text} run in the lowest screenmode possible.
    @{fg shine}C@{fg text} cross ya fingaz.... and keep 'em that way untill it's all over!

    @{fg shine}i can't get 'lowtech' ep going! it hangs while initializing the effect!@{fg text}

    you are runnig the ep under aga, and the effect requires quite a bit of
    chipmem! do the following to free as much memory as possible;

    @{fg shine}C@{fg text} boot without startup-sequence.
    @{fg shine}C@{fg text} disable all partitions not needed.
    @{fg shine}C@{fg text} decrease the buffers for the partition(s) with addbuffers.

    @{fg shine}C@{fg text} cross ya fingaz.... and keep 'em that way untill it's all over!

    @{fg shine}i found this weird bug, and it ain't mentioned here!@{fg text}
