@node mystify "What is mystify"

	What is mystify:
	----------------

	- Mystify is MULTITASKING music disk
	- It contains good music from BFB Team's musician.
	- It's capable to run on ANY amiga with KS 1.3 and above.
	- It uses ONLY system fuctions, so if Mystify isn't working with your
	  graphics card, you can't blame me. (I hope :)
	- It can be installed on HD.
	- Doesn't require AGA but can be run on one.
	- Because Mystify uses system's screen, it automacicly supports
	  mode promotions.
	- And the best: It doesn't crash. (Pretty wild, huh :)

@node troubles "Trouble shooting"

	Somewhy you are not able to run Mystify. I've collected some
	error cases and sollutions for them in a list below:

	Q: I type mystify in a cli window but after a short loading
	   nothing happens.
	A: There may be 3 reasons for this: diskfont.library couldn't be
	   opened, you have ran out of memory or Mystify failed when he
	   tried to open fonts. Currently Mystify uses fonts opal 12 and
	   ruby 12. Make sure that they exist in your fonts: drawer.

	Q: I have made an icon for Mystify, but when I try to launch it, my
	   machine crashes to guru 87000004.
	A: Mystify isn't meant to be runnable from WB. That's because files
	   cannot be located without special code. And because I'm too lazy
	   to write such piece of code, you won't be able to run it from WB
	   and that's about that.

	Q: After start mystify starts to load a module but that fails and
	   says only: No chip mem!. 
	A: That's because you ARE short of chipmem. I use P61 mods, with
	   packed samples, so the biggest modules may not fit into 512 kb
	   chip memory. If you get this message, don't you think that it
	   would be time to buy a new amiga. Like A1200. ;)

	Q: After start Mystify just says "Cannot locate modules" or "Where
	   is modnames.dat"
	A: You have tried to run mystify from a drawer that doesn't contain
	   all needed files. You see, mystify tries to load modules from
	   drawer "Modules/" from where it was run from. If this drawer
	   doesn't exist or is empty then mystify will fail.
	   ModNames.dat and ModuleTxts.dat must be in the same directory 
	   that Mystify was ran from. They contain important info for
	   Mystify.

	If you can't find what's wrong even with these instructions, then
	you may contact me and ask. My address can be found @{" here " link creds}
