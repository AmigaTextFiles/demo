About the Modules...(Di-Mension Speaking)

Here I am, back again.In this little
note I give you some info...
- About sample-quality of the mods.
  and how to get a better version
  of the modules (if you really want to).

 1st. The modules are PACKED with 
The Player 6.1A ([Programmed by
Jarno Paananen] as you probably have
noticed), because we thought that
saving diskspace is more important
than little decrease in sound-quality,
as the unpacked mods. would have taken
2 to 3 disks...

 2nd. The Samples / Mods. make some
purposeless noise (for exmpl. snaping 
and clicking). Almost all of these 
noises come from the sample-packing 
method that the Player 6.1 uses.
 It seems to make some clicks and 
snaps to the starts/ends of the 
samples...

 3rd. If YOU really Want full lenght,
UNPACKED and MOD.#? version of one (or
all) of the P6.1A(s) of this pack...
Then, ... Write to me and SEND a blank
(?) DISK(S) with your letter and tell me
WHICH module(s) You want...

 4th. ...And the Address is...
