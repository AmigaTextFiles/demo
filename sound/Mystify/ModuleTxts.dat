Daydream (1992 version)
-----------------------

Daydream... Originally made in

1990, but remix job was done in 1992.

Quite nice tune in my opinion.
 
Please listen entire module...


Feeling So Real (Freak Club Rmx)
--------------------------------

One of the newest modules in this

collection. This is supposed to

be kind of remix from Mobys tune.

N-joi and stay tuned...


Freak
-----

As the name tells, this is NOT

supposed to be a normal sounding 

or most popular type of music.
 
It's only just minimalistic.


Liquid-Thoughts 2
-----------------

Part 2 - of a most weird tune

that I have ever heard on

Amiga computers...

It's... made in 1995...


New Funk
-------- 

A funky tune. Made with samples

from Mobys "Elecfunk"...

Cool samples indeed...

Enjoy...


Take It Or Leave It
-------------------

An other old tune from 1990,

but as you can hear, it's much

different and more developed.

Listen and enjoy...


After a Half Year
-----------------

One of very rare acid(?)-type

modules to Amiga... or have

you heard something like this

before... anyway, enjoy...


Grumb 2
-------

That name doesn't mean anything

so put that dictionary away... :)

This quite strange house planted

tune, was made about a three months ago.


Schizophrenic Sympathy
----------------------

What a word! 

This is another tune that I 

suggest you to listen entirely.

And don't complain... :)


Sven Ska Magiska
----------------

Something like a Amiga conversion

of Sven Vaths tune "The Beauty and

the Beast". If you have heard it

I bet you can identify it...


Wheel Off
---------

In my opinion, this is the best

tune in here, so listen up...  

quite a housy tune indeed.

Enjoy as I have said b4. %>


Zip Samples
-----------

I think this is the way of saving 

disk space, when doing stupid music

compilations like this. Look at the

length and listen up, you'll understand. 


No more modules here, sorry...

but in every case I am happy 2

notice that somebody have dug

throught this piece of crap.

Thanks from entire production

team and specially from me.
