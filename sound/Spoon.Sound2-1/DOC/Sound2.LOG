Well, I really thought this was locked, but while waiting for a (MUCH)
delayed intro, I could brush up a few minor details :

Main.c : 1.01

* all decrunchs now done via GFXDecrunch(), this saves space, and ensures
  uniform response to decrunch errors

GFXSupport.c : 1.02
* now fully cleans up, and makes meaningfull requesters informing of
  eventual error conditions, however, in the case of a severe error,
  I can't always guarantee a stable machine

 SOUND 2 is locked at this revision level...
 next update will be Sound 3 !!

 Forthcoming features :
 Running better on GFX cards, at the moment it can be MADE to run
 more or less (mostly less) smoothly on Retina blt Z3
 This will not be easy, but if it can be done, then this proggy will
 be real hot, as the mods will enable it to run on most major GFX cards
 (under their relevant Emulators !!)
