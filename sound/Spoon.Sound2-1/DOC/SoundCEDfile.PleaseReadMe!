    ØKF ¬ØØ    YES!  This is the scenes only compilation  of
   ÆØ¹   ØØ   music. - No one else  have had success in this
   ØØ   Æ#´   business.  The third issue  is on its way, and 
   ¬Øo_Jw´    that means that Sound finally  has  placed  it 
   __   ____  self on the scene map, as  an entertaining and
   XF   eØ/´  solid  production  thanks to a  lot  of  great 
  fØ¹   fO    people.

  ¬Øo_JOF.      Sound is  and ANTI chip collection  of music   
    ¯¯¯ ¯     pieces build on an idea way  back in 1988.  To  
  +wa_ø*a_    create a special atmosphere, Sound is based on
   #ÆF ¬ØØ    80 Kb  modules,  which gives  the musician  an 
   ¶F¹  fØ    interesting competitive limitation.  No matter
   ÆF   Æ#´   how you turn it around, the Sound samples will
  áOL _J#L    always  provide a  different sound or feeling, 
              than you are used to.Still it is the musicians
       ¯wø+   duty to work out a module, that involves great
   _*Oa á@    atmosphere of  wich should give the receiver a  
  ÆO¹ ¬ØØ     test drive in an  underground of the effectual 
  ØF   áF     experimenting world.  A world of Sound music!!

    ¯¯ ¯¯¯      Sound  is  a game!  At some points it is ac-
  tually  rather difficult  to make such  modules.  A lot of 
  musicians  has either  given up  on the way, or they don`t 
  want to deal with it at all.  All because of the tough li-
  mitations.  The hardcore "Sound Surfers" do know the game!  
  The Sound Surfers provides us with  great modules of which       
  they  have cut, squezed, looped, and tried to use one sam-
  ple in as many ways  as possible, to create the most vivid 
  module ever seen.  And they succeed!

    Sound involves a special feature for each issue. Sound 1 
  featured Futuristic music, while Sound 2 featured Funk mu-
  sic.  The  third  issue of Sound will give you an interes-
  ting view into todays TRANCE music. A dazed, dozed, groggy 
  jukebox  with feelings that makes everyone  go  beyond the 
  visual in yourself. A mind frame for all sceners to enjoy!    

    If  you  think  you  should be a part of Sound issue #3, 
  then you should get  started  on  your  TRANCE  module, of 
  which  you should send to the Sound HQ within 1. MAY 1995.  
    Remember that the rules is as following:  Maximum 80Kb`s
  UNPACKED modules, of which no CHIP samples are allowed!!!!
  You  are allowed to send  as  many modules you  want,  but 
  only two modules from  each musician will as a maximum get
  published in  one Sound  issue!  You are allowed to choose 
  your  own tempo, since Sound  operates in  CIA timing, but
  due to this fact, please remember to test your module with
  The Player V6 before sending. Please write all facts  down 
  about your modules, - Coming up at the end!  Send your mo-
  dules along two discs,  since  Sound is a two disc produc-
  tion!  Disc back service is ofcourse a guarantee!

    If you would like to receive Sound #3 or help in another
  way, it is  possible by sending 3  disks and your votes a-
  long.  To place  your votes,  please  consider all modules 
  from ALL issues of Sound.  The best module should enter on 
  the first place, the second best on second place etc.  all 
  the way to the third place!  The reason why we need you to 
  send 3 discs, is  because, two of  the discs is for Sound, 
  the  third  is for postal.  If you are a Dane, then please 
  send a 5 Dkr. stamp and two discs instead!
