History so far :

The original code for Sound #1, has almost NOT been reused for 
this program for several reasons :
The original code  was a superb  example  of how NOT to code a 
program intended for easy maintaining..
The  source consisted of two main parts and a host of support-
files,  which  not  even I could remember quite which did what 
and why :)
Also  the  code was very bad, and resembled nothing as much as 
the fact that it was written in great haste...
The  goal for the Sound 2  Source, is to achieve as much modu-
larity  as possible, thereby making migration of the code pos-
sible.  This could be used to port it to run on GFX-Cards,  or 
even  a Port to  other machines  (PC's, PowerPC's, HP-Apollo's 
etc...)  I  would only have  to update for  example GFXSupport 
(and the replayer if I port to a new machine)


This  program has  been written entirely in 'C' except for the 
following :
       The Decruncher (RNC V2)
       The Replayer (The Player V6.1A)

The source for Sound 2 is divided into these modules :
 Main.c :
                Opens global stuff, calls GFX routines, etc...
                Portable to any C-compiler (& therefor compu-
                ter :) )
                There is some native (Amiga-OS) stuff in this, 
                but this will be  fairly  easy to port (I hope
                /suspect :)

 GFXSupport.c :
                Implementation specific graphics routines..
                Currently 1 version :
                 One for Native AGA Amiga's
                 This allocates screens, loads, and  decrunches 
                 screen data, and handles gadgets etc..

 FileSupport.c : 
                Implementation  of  General  File Loading rou-
                tines...

 IntroSequence.c :
                This run the  Spoon  intro sequence, ie. shows 
                some nice pictures.

 OnBoardGFX.c :
                This contains the 'onboard' graphics, gadgets 
                and stuff, which is too small to deserve sepa-
                rate loading..

 Texts.c :
                This  contains  ModuleInfo's, Rules text,  and 
                the dreaded Editorial...
                I don't  change this  so often, so it's better 
                to leave it  in a separate file, and save com-
                pilation time..

 P61.o :
                This is a version of The Player V6.1 by Guru / 
                Sahara Surfers adapted to work with C programs 
                (Parameter calls etc..)

 RNC_2.o :
                This  is  a Decruncher  for the ProPack 2.x by 
                Rob Northen. This decrunches 'mode 2' crunched 
                files.

 Due to  the way I am  organizing  things the  Main program is 
 quite small.  The Final Compile gives ca. 57 Kb. Compare this 
 with 'EuroChart's 4-500 Kb (unpacked) Modularity Rulez :)

 as of 14.02.95 nearly all the code is up and running...
 It shows the texts correctlym and the Loader's are working...
 now it is a matter of  banging on the selectors visually, and 
 tackle the dreaded Intro-Sequence.. and  ofcourse waiting for 
 the Intro..

 as of 17.02.95  all the code is finished,  and  it appears to 
 work :)  Especially the selector gadgets were  quite funny to 
 set up...
 Sometimes Intuition can be a real pain...  If you  use struct 
 Image stuff, it  destroys the data  in all  6 bitplanes, even 
 though the image is only 5 planes deep.  Therefor  I  decided 
 to use struct Borders instead..
 Why is the autodocs for intuition so strange ??
 The documentation says the  Border uses  a sequence of vector 
 coordinates, but it is really  just plain coordinates !!!  It 
 looked very funny until I caught this little bug :)
 
 as of 24.02.95  I am getting REAL tired of this production..
 all code is running, and everything appears to be ok.
 I have gotten all the GFX inseted at its place, including
 some GFX I only found out I needed, when i looked through the
 data directory in order to clean out not needed files..
 Now there is pretty images for both sets of selectors :)

 The most of the time between 25.02 & 2.03 has been spent both
 waiting for the Intro, and bugfixing some stuff...
 The only real significant changes are :
 Sound now works form Startup-Sequence (as it should)
 You can Pause and Exit the Editorial

 For more insight into the progress of how I made this, read
 the text file called Sound2.LOG, it is sort of a day to day
 diary of what happened when..

 Small Instructions :

 In the CLI type Sound2 <return>

 When tired of it, either press ESCAPE or click on the 
  'exit to DOS' gadget

 Press the keys 1-\ on the keyboard(above the alphabetic keys)
 to load the 13 selectable tunes !!
 Due to policies, you can NOT reselect the wonderful first mo-
 dule, as this module is larger than the rest of  the modules, 
 and is a special introduction piece.  This is  NEVER meant to 
 be re-selectable... listen, push gadget and weep :)

 Simple, eh... ??

 Amongst  the response to Sound #1, several  people  (swappers 
 mostly) have complained  that  Sound wasn't a 'one file' pro-
 gram, but that would be a real pain in the ***!!!
 I would have to make it either with overlays, since it  isn't 
 feasible to load ALL of the stuff (300Kb gfx & 500 Kb msx) at 
 once  AND leave space for  buffers,  spare screens etc... and 
 frankly, I know zilch about overlays..
 Or make it as 2 files..
 A main program and one large datafile, like  some diskmags do 
 it...  I have thought about this, but I find it  much  easier 
 to do it with my current system of separate files...

 Sound #2 is developed on the following configuration :

  Commodore Amiga A1200, 2Mb Chip memory, AGA chipset
  Kickstart V 3.0 (39.106)
  Workbench V 3.0 (39.29)
  X-tra diskdrive,of suspect manufacturing:) (6 years/no err's)
  Quantum Prodrive ELP120 120 Mb 3½" HD

 Tested on :
  A1200, No FastRam, Kick 3
  A1200, 4 Mb FastRam, Kick 3 (Thanx Merge)
  A4030, 2 Mb Chip, 2 Mb Fast, Kick 3 (Thanx Bagger)


 Tools used in the creation of Sound #2 so far :

 SAS/C Amiga C/C++ compiler V6.50
  (I hope SAS Institure reconsiders their dropping the Amiga..
   it will be irritating to port this to eg. Maxon C/C++ 3)

 Cygnussoft CED 3.5
  (Miles beyond SAS/C's SE editor :)

 HiSoft Devpac Amiga Assembler V3.04
  (The best for serious system programming)
 ASM-One V1.25 by The Flame Arrows
  (GURU/S2 : Why did you drop the Devpac versions of P61 ???)

 Electronic Arts Deluxe Paint V4.5 (AGA)
  (It's old, It's slow, but it is trustworthy :)

 Cloanto's Personal Paint V6
  (Why can't DPaint use Sound's legal system font ??)

 PicCon V2.5 (Registered Version :)
  (This program is REALLY great, go out and register it today)

 ExoticRipper V2.27 (Registered)

 ProPack 2.08 by Rob Northen Computing
  (This cruncher gives really great performance !!
   the raw GFX data for sound takes up 1740800 bytes
   the crunched gfx takes               302202 bytes
   that is a crunch to only 17.36 % !!!)

 The Player V6.1A (610.1) -  08.01.95 by Guru / Sahara Surfers
  (The best for both speedy replay, and good diskspace saving)

 Directory Opus V4.12 by Innovatronics
  (nice.. still waiting for V5)

 DiskMaster V2.1c by Greg Cunningham / Progressive Peripherals 
 Inc.
  (not so advanced but uses MUCH less memory than DOpus)

 AmigaDate by Tomi Ollila <too@cardhu.cs.hut.fi>
  (one of those tools you wonder how you got by without)

 Special Hardware used :

 Commodore Amiga CD32+FMV,
  to keep my mind distracted while I work :)

 Special thanks so far :

 Estrup / Static Bytes for input on how to 'cheat' Intuition..
  Actually the idea is NOT to cheat Intui.. For 12 revisions I 
  was  using an  interlieved  bitmap, and this has given me NO 
  end of headaches as blitting into this,and extending it with 
  an extra bitplane for text etc, was NOT so easy.
  Estrup  claimed, that it wasn't neccessary  to use an inter-
  lieved screen, and he was right:)(I don't know why it didn't 
  work before ??)

 Merge / Polka B.	for being friendly

 Airwalk / Polka B.  for keeping me writing in C :)  (You keep 
  bugging me to write it in ASM, so  I  keep  bugging you  and
  keep  on  doing it in C ;^)  Thanx for the wipe 'algorithm', 
  but as of 14.02, I got some response on my current wipes, so 
  it  will probably  not be implemented...  except  maybe  for 
  Sound #3, when I have rewritten it in C :)

 Colin	Some day I WILL do a GFX card version,in the meantime, 
  I am REALLY  enjoying that CD32... Now  I just have to get a 
  SX-1 :)

 Slide / Polka B. Well the music for my 40K was nice atleast:)
  Thanks for lending me the batch of CD's...  Now I have some-
  thing to listen to :)

 Bagger  For letting me run this on a 4030,and for coming with 
  good suggestions  concerning code, even though  I seldom use 
  them :) (I don't know  if the 'hack'  from Viacom is necces-
  sary ??) (actually i KNOW the 'hack' form Viacom is not nec-
  cessary :)

 The AD&D 2nd. Ed. Crowd,  for taking my mind of off things at
  least once in the week...

 Guru / Sahara Surfers for keeping on updating The Player, and 
  making it more powerful with each revision...

 To these for keeping me 'sane' :

 J.M.Jarre        : Concerts in China, Equinoxe, Oxygene
 Queen            : A Day At The Races, The Game,News of 
                    the world, Innuendo, Greatest Hits I+II

 Look out for other forthcoming Spoon productions :

  Blue Savannah : 
        A Harddisk only, Music-Experience-Demo
        Code by : Shayera, GFX by : CDLQ,AXE, SFX by : B-Toven 
        (after Erasure)
        This demo will be an AGA  and  Harddisk  only,  as the 
        amount of data is too great to be  practical on floppy 
        disk, and besides; HD's are cheap,  so  let's all sup-
        port them, and then we can make as nice demo's  as the 
        PC's !!!

 If you are interested in joining Spoon (and you should be !!)
 Then  send us some examples of your work.. Coders should con-
 tact me (Shayera)  All  others contact  Christine de La Queen 
 (adress elsewhere on this disk)

 We are searching for :
        Coders (AGA experience preferred)
        SFX    (Protracker, or PT compatible (Fast/Take/Scream 
               etc.. 4 channels .MOD)
        GFX    (A 'full screen' painter would be nice)
        Trace  (NOT just another  'look  at them glassballs on 
               that chessplane')

 We`ll put up people from Saudi Arabia or Kuwait are very wel-
 come, and can contact us concerning our special economic sup-
 port member program (ESMP)  (We promise nice long letters and 
 cheap membership :) (ok, just kidding, but don't hold back if 
 you want to support us ;)

 Advert :

     If you are an official representative from a game company 
 seeking  new employees, then I can be contacted  at the above 
 address... I am fluent in 68K Assembler, and 'C', and,as this 
 program shows,I am not afraid of working in big projects with 
 modular builds.  This  has  been a good excercise in managing 
 such a project,and I feel pretty confident about my abilities 
 when it comes to coding on the Commodore Amiga series of mini 
 computers.  I  have  also  some  experience  in   coding  the 
 Commodore  64, but this is probably  not  of any significance 
 here in 1995 :)
