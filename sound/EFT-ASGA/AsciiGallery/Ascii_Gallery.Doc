              A New Production By the Effect And Friends crew! 



+-[Delay's delay's delay's...]----------------------------------------------+

After much delays and stuff like that, we finally released The Ascii Gallery.
It started out as a little project, with only a few ascii's and musics,
but later we decided to add a cuty-style intro, and a hidden part.
Mayby we even started a new style of ascii collections!
But remember, copyright 1996 EFFECT! :)

+-[System requirements.]----------------------------------------------------+

This demo runs on any Amiga with 1 megabyte of chipmemory, and 
1 megabyte of other memory.
things may be a tad slow sometimes on a standart 68000, but runs perfectly
on a 68020 or higher.

+-[Also very important... Credits!]-----------------------------------------+

+-[Installing The Ascii Gallery to HD.]-------------------------------------+

Create a new drawer on your harddisk.
copy the following files to that directory:

Ascii_Gallery.Exe
Ascii_Gallery.Doc

And also copy the entire Data drawer over to the directory on your HD.

To make the demo run from your HD, you need to assign the name
Ascii_Gallery: to the drawer on your HD.

You can also use the scriptfile in the HD drawer of the original disk.

Now type Ascii_gallery.Exe to run the demo.
(or the special script file ofcourse :))
