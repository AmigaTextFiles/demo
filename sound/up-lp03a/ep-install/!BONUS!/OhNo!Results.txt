Oh No! More Hits For Kids AHX Compo Results!

We had such a big response when we asked for
AHX tunes for this LP, that we had to vote for
the 20 best ones to include in the LP.
We (the whole Up Rough crew gathered at Up Rough
Hustla Konvention Part 3, boozed a lot, listened 
to all 55 tunes and voted!) We received 55(!) tunes!
So if you are among the lucky ones included on
the LP, be happy! =)
Some changes had to be made to the final 
playlist as we found out that some of the tunes
we received was already released.
