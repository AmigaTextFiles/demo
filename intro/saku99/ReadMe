                                  -------

Finnish  Amiga  Users  Group is pleased to announce it's third annual Amiga
event, Saku 99. Following the success of Saku 98, which was visited by some
500  Amiga  enthusiasts,  Saku 99 is aimed to be bigger and better than the
previous events. Mr. Petro Tyschtschenko of Amiga has already confirmed his
presence and other great highlights are planned.

Saku  99  will be held on Saturday September 4th 1999 at the Science Centre
Heureka  in  Vantaa,  near Helsinki. The venue is the same as last year and
available floor space has been increased by reserving an extra hall for the
event.  The  event is expected to open at 12:00 and end at 18:00. Admission
will  be free of charge. Please stay tuned for more details as the planning
progresses.
