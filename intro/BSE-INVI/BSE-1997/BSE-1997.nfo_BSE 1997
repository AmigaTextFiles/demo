          here we go with yet another "la vache qui rit" production

                    this is what some people might call an

                          "official invitaton intro"

                           but we prefer to call it

                       "VERY official invitation intro"

                        Some notes from Grey (mooh!):
  After 595(!) days of lazyness I'm very happy to present a new production!
       Thanks must go to MeloManiac for his fast & great work, to Scout
    for the c2p used in this intro, to Guru for the replayer and to Marvin
         for supplying me with a bunch of high quality cow-pictures!
     I tried to combine some old school elements (copper & sprite usage)
    with more recent aspects of demo making (c2p)... the music by MeloBop
      fitted perfectly for this project, though he didn't even know that
                  there will be such a lot of cows in it :)
