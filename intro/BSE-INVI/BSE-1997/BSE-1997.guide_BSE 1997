                                Introduction
                               --------------

Welcome to the invitation guide to the BSE '97 or The Belgian Scene Event 1997,
the COWlest Amoooooooooooga party in Belgium in YEARS ! (The last decent Amiga
party was in 1992, the TRSi Easter conference - we all remember that one ;).


                                    What
                                   ------

The Belgian Scene Event 1997 will be a small but cool @{b}Amiga Only@{ub} party
held by @{i}Crux & Bad Karma@{ui} in Hasselt, a town in the northwest corner of
Belgium, close to the borders of:
                 Germany         (apx. 50km.)
                 The Netherlands (apx. 30km.)
                 Luxembourgh     (apx. 40km.)
                 France          (apx. 80km.)

Don't let these distances scare you since it is a rather high aproximate ;).
Anyhow, the partyplace is at 300m of a rather big expressway, so you won't
have any troubles finding it.


                                    Why
                                   -----

OK, you probably wonder how we can be so mad organizing a party in a nowhere-
land like Belgium.  Well make it easy we want to prove that there IS indeed a
scene left in Belgium and that it can still organize something decent. And to
make this sure: This is not Wired 97 and it hasn't anything to do with it!

But remember that we make this party for FUN.  We dont want to make ANY money
on it, all we have left will go to the prize-money for the competitions.



                        Well, we hope we can welcome you at the BSE 1997,

                                                        @{b}CRiSP of CBK

                                  Where and when ?
                                 ------------------

The BSE 1997 party will take place at the last weekend of August 1997,
meaning @{b}August, the 29th, 30th and 31st@{ub}. The doors will open the 29th
of August at noon (12:00) and they will close the 31th of August at
noon (12:00), so all you peeps can get home before school starts again ;).
(For a more detailed schedule, see @{" party schedule " link "progr"}).

The party place will be @{b}Zaal Crutzenhof@{ub} in Hasselt (and that is
in the province of Limburg).

NOTE: The party-organizers are at the party place starting from Friday 29th,
      6:00 AM. If you arrive earlier, you will nothing :(

                                 How to get there ?
                                --------------------

Please don't get scared off by the lengthy texts ;) - We mentioned every
detail you can see when you drive towards the party place. It is just to
make sure that everybody gets where they have to be. Signs will be put out
everywhere, but please bring a map to be sure (the signs might get removed
by some law enforcement evil forces ;)


@{b}By car:@{ub}
@{b}-------@{ub}

Following is a classification for every country. This has been made to make
things easier for all of us. The explanations are kept as simple as possible,
and we will place signs to lead you at every cross-section!
If you DO get lost in Hasselt, there is nothing to worry about: just follow
all directions pointing to the 'Grote Ring' (big circle-like road around the
town of Hasselt) and keep on driving around that 'Grote Ring' until you see
a sign saying either 'BSE 1997 - This way ->' or 'Kuringersteenweg'. Take the
'Kuringersteenweg' that goes INTO the town of Hasselt. If you take the
direction 'Kuringen' you will drive away. Once you're on the 'Kuringersteenweg'
just follow the instructions for Belgian people.

                            @{" German people   " link "car"}
                            @{" Dutch people    " link "car"}


@{b}By train:@{ub}
@{b}---------@{ub}

By train see you get to the station of Hasselt (Limburg). The partyplace
is at 200m of the station. (For foreigners: Take the train to Brussels,
then take the first one to Hasselt/Genk & Luik/Maastricht (make sure
that you sit in the front wagons, the last ones will go to Holland :).

Here are some train-hours :

Direct trains to Hasselt leave in Brussels (station Bruxelles-Midi) at xx:18
(mostly from track 12, but check to be sure).  At xx+1:45 you'll be in
Hasselt then.

Another way is take the train to Luik & Collogne in Brussels (BXL-Midi)
at xx:48.  Get off in Leuven (the first stop after Brussels, the third after
Bruxelles-Midi) and run to platform 3 (mostly !) where you can get the train
to Hasselt/Landen at xx+1:25 (the train to Luik/Collogne will arrive in Leuven
at xx+1:17 so better be quick hehehe) to be in Hasselt at xx+2:10.

If you want to take the direct train to Hasselt in Leuven, its there at xx:47,
mostly on track 4.

On friday you will have trains till about midnight..  In the weekends aim
at 22:00 for the last train to and from Hasselt.

When you are in the front of the Hasselt station, you will see lots of
busstops in front of  you. Take the street on the RIGHT OPPOSITE hand of
the square (the F. Massystraat). You will end up at a pretty big road called
the KONINGIN ASTRIDLAAN. Walk left here and take the third one to the RIGHT.
(The Lazarijsstraat). Then (after 20m) take the first one to the LEFT
and walk straigth through (you'll cross one road). After about 100m you will see
the partyplace indicated :).

Another way to remember this is to follow all the CRISTAL signs (that's a
Belgian Beer). It is a red plate with a white sign. At the station of Hasselt,
there is this pub with a Cristal sign, go into that street (F. Massystraat),
go to the left, until you come across another cristal sign (Lazarijsstraat).
Enter it, after 20m take the first to the right until you get at another Cristal
sign, the partyplace! :)))


                                The cash stuff
                               ----------------

Entrance fee will be set at 350 BEF (Belgian francs) per person, we only
accept Belgian francs. If you really insist you can also pay in other
currencies, but keep in mind that the exchange rates are not our means
of mesure - you will pay more if you pay in other currencies!

Girls get free entrance ofcourse!

Just to give you an idea of how much 350 BEF is, here is a list with
exchange rates (we will NOT use the following list for entrance fee
money!)

 350 BEF        =       $10 or DM 18 or Fl. 20 or 60 FF
 250 BEF        =       $7 or DM 11 or Fl. 15 or 45 FF

If you want to pay in advance, no problem..  The price then is 250 BEF
(Belgian francs, same stuff as above) per person. If you pay in advance,
your money will not be refunded if you don't show up at the party, sorry.
Also no change on advance payments.

You can mail the money to:
PO BOX 25
3000 LEUVEN 3
Belgium.

With the cash send your 'password'.  We'll ask you for it at the entrance
if you claim to have payed in advance. If someone else knew about your
password and got in with your money before you..  tuff luck. Better find
the dude and kill him (OUTSIDE the party-place please !). Also add your
first name and handle please

And ofcourse if you dont like the Belgian postal service, you can use a
bank-transfer too..  The account-number is 330-0201835-32. In the message
put your handle, real name and password.

                            How to get there by car ?
                           ---------------------------


@{i}Belgian@{ui} people:
Just make sure you get on the E313 highway (Antwerp/Anvers/Antwerpen ->
Köln/Cologne/Keulen). Take exit 27 (Kuringen) and just continue following the
road you are on (this will be for a kilometer or 10)... This road is called
the 'Kuringersteenweg'. After these 10km's you'll arrive in Hasselt, continue
driving until you get at the Grote Ring. Here you have to cross the street
and actually follow the road you are on. @{b}Take the third to the left
(the Lazarusstraat). Then (after 20 - 40m) take the first to the right.
That is the 'Oude Kuringerbaan'. You will see the partyplace indicated by
the 'Cristal' sign that is outside (that is a red plate with a white logo on it).@{ub}


@{i}German@{ui} people:
Okay, quite simple: Whereever you are coming from, just make sure you get on
the E313 (also called A2 in Belgium, the A76 in The Netherlands or highway 4
in Germany). This road runs from Aachen 'till Leuven (Louvain), but it passes
in Genk (the town next to Hasselt). Just follow this road (immergerade aus,
through the Netherlands, into Belgium) until you get at exit 31 (Genk). Follow
this road until you get in the town of Diepenbeek. In Diepenbeek you just have
to drive straight through, you will cross a rather large road that takes you
in the center of the town of Diepenbeek, drive straight through (you have to
pass a factory called 'Jaga') until you cross the E313 (another expressway). You
can't miss this road, you drive up a hill - it is the only HUGE road in the damn
place - and it is indicated with E313 - Antwerpen. Take the direction Antwerpen
(meaning you have to turn in right). Okay, just follow this road until you get
at exit 27 (Kuringen) and follow the instructions for the Belgian people!


@{i}Dutch@{ui} people:
This is also quite easy, although the route may vary if you live in the
western parts of the Netherlands. Anyhow, here we go:
Make your way to Belgium. There are 2 major possibilities, either via
Breda or Eindhoven.

 - Breda:
    Take the road to Antwerp, and once you're in Antwerp, follow the 'Ring'
    and take the E313, direction Liège/Luik. Keep on driving (for about 80km)
    until you get at exit 27 (Kuringen). Go off there and follow the @{b}bold@{ub}
    instructions for Belgian users.
 - Eindhoven:
    This is a bit more complicated (meaning that you have to take some
    smaller roads). Anyhow, just make your way to Belgium, and drive to
    Hasselt (pass some cities like Hechtel-Eksel, Heusden-Zolder and Zonhoven)
    until you arrive at the 'Grote Ring' in Hasselt. Just follow that one
    (drive to the right when you get there) until you get at the 'Kuringer-
    steenweg'. Take that one (direction Hasselt, NOT Kuringen) and follow the
    @{b}bold@{ub} instructions for Belgian users

                                  ---------------

The partyplace is a recently constructed building and has all modern
means of comfort. A seperate sleeping hall in the complex is provided
(and it *IS* isolated & silent!). Toilets and stuff are also nice and
clean. Too bad there aren't any showers in the complex.

Inside the party place a bar will be available with all kinds of drinks
(beer -taste the real and only Belgian beers-, water, coke, etc.) at
CHEAP prizes <see further>. You will also be able to buy some sandwiches
over there for the same price of a drink (read: CHEAP FOOD :)

At the partyplace, all foods & drinks are the same price: you get 3
consumptions (whether it is beer, coke or food) for 100 BEF.

You are at about 5 mins from the main center of Hasselt, which
has LOTS of pubs, snack bars, also at very acceptable prices (but not as
cheap as in the partyplace :). and for all you party freaks:
The biggest disco from the region is at a 10 mins walk or 2 mins drive :))

A helpdesk will be available 24/24. If there are any problems, you can
easily ask your questions there!

And to make it clear for the first and last time : There will be
@{b}NO Cybercafe@{b} of any way and certainly @{b}NO party-network@{ub}.
Ofcourse you are totally free to set up those things yourself and
we wont be mad for it, but it's something we dont have the time
and cash for to organise...

Please keep these things in mind when you're at the party :

- All the hardware that you bring is at @{b}YOUR responsibility@{ub}, dont come
  and cry to the organizers if it gets broken/stolen/whatever.

- Troublemakers will be thrown out or even be handed over to the police.

- If you're too intoxicated (read drunk/stoned/...) you will be denied
  entrance to the party-place until you are decent again.

- @{b}If you make a mess of the party-place or the neighbourhood, YOU clean it
  up and pay ANY damage.@{ub} We'll have people patrolling the partyplace at
  every time of the day!

- If you damage something, YOU pay for it.  No cash ? Don't worry,
  we'll call your parents.

- The organizers have to be seen as almighty gods and their word is law
  in the partyplace. If you wanna play smart, meet mr. baseball-bat! :)

                                Introduction
                               --------------

Welcome to the invitation guide to the BSE '97 or The Belgian Scene Event 1997,
the COWlest Amoooooooooooga party in Belgium in YEARS ! (The last decent Amiga
party was in 1992, the TRSi Easter conference - we all remember that one ;).


                                    What
                                   ------

The Belgian Scene Event 1997 will be a small but cool @{b}Amiga Only@{ub} party
held by @{i}Crux & Bad Karma@{ui} in Hasselt, a town in the northwest corner of
Belgium, close to the borders of:
                 Germany         (apx. 50km.)
                 The Netherlands (apx. 30km.)
                 Luxembourgh     (apx. 40km.)
                 France          (apx. 80km.)

Don't let these distances scare you since it is a rather high aproximate ;).
Anyhow, the partyplace is at 300m of a rather big expressway, so you won't
have any troubles finding it.


                                    Why
                                   -----

OK, you probably wonder how we can be so mad organizing a party in a nowhere-
land like Belgium.  Well make it easy we want to prove that there IS indeed a
scene left in Belgium and that it can still organize something decent.And to
make this sure: This is not Wired 97 and it hasn't anything to do with it!

But remember that we make this party for FUN.  We dont want to make ANY money
on it, all we have left will go to the prize-money for the competitions.



                        Well, we hope we can welcome you at the BSE 1997,

                                                        @{b}CRiSP of CBK
                                                        FRaNKy of CBK@{ub}

                                  Where and when ?
                                 ------------------

The BSE 1997 party will take place at the last weekend of August 1997,
meaning @{b}August, the 29th, 30th and 31st@{ub}. The doors will open the 29th
of August at noon (12:00) and they will close the 31th of August at
noon (12:00), so all you peeps can get home before school starts again ;).
(For a more detailed schedule, see @{" party schedule " link "progrv34"}).

The party place will be @{b}Zaal Crutzenhof@{ub} in Hasselt (and that is
in the province of Limburg).

NOTE: The party-organizers are at the party place starting from Friday 29th,
      6:00 AM. If you arrive earlier, you will nothing :(

                                 How to get there ?
                                --------------------

Please don't get scared off by the lengthy texts ;) - We mentioned every
detail you can see when you drive towards the party place. It is just to
make sure that everybody gets where they have to be. Signs will be put out
everywhere, but please bring a map to be sure (the signs might get removed
by some law enforcement evil forces ;)


@{b}By car:@{ub}
@{b}-------@{ub}

Following is a classification for every country. This has been made to make
things easier for all of us. The explanations are kept as simple as possible,
and we will place signs to lead you at every cross-section!
If you DO get lost in Hasselt, there is nothing to worry about: just follow
all directions pointing to the 'Grote Ring' (big circle-like road around the
town of Hasselt) and keep on driving around that 'Grote Ring' until you see
a sign saying either 'BSE 1997 - This way ->' or 'Kuringersteenweg'. Take the
'Kuringersteenweg' that goes INTO the town of Hasselt. If you take the
direction 'Kuringen' you will drive away. Once you're on the 'Kuringersteenweg'
just follow the instructions for Belgian people.

                            @{" German people   " link "car"}
                            @{" Dutch people    " link "car"}


@{b}By train:@{ub}
@{b}---------@{ub}

By train see you get to the station of Hasselt (Limburg). The partyplace
is at 200m of the station. (For foreigners: Take the train to Brussels,
then take the first one to Hasselt/Genk & Luik/Maastricht (make sure
that you sit in the front wagons, the last ones will go to Holland :).

Here are some train-hours :

Direct trains to Hasselt leave in Brussels (station Bruxelles-Midi) at xx:18
(mostly from track 12, but check to be sure).  At xx+1:45 you'll be in
Hasselt then.

Another way is take the train to Luik & Collogne in Brussels (BXL-Midi)
at xx:48.  Get off in Leuven (the first stop after Brussels, the third after
Bruxelles-Midi) and run to platform 3 (mostly !) where you can get the train
to Hasselt/Landen at xx+1:25 (the train to Luik/Collogne will arrive in Leuven
at xx+1:17 so better be quick hehehe) to be in Hasselt at xx+2:10.

If you want to take the direct train to Hasselt in Leuven, its there at xx:47,
mostly on track 4.

On friday you will have trains till about midnight..  In the weekends aim
at 22:00 for the last train to and from Hasselt.

When you are in the front of the Hasselt station, you will see lots of
busstops in front of  you. Take the street on the RIGHT OPPOSITE hand of
the square (the F. Massystraat). You will end up at a pretty big road called
the KONINGIN ASTRIDLAAN. Walk left here and take the third one to the RIGHT.
(The Lazarijsstraat). Then (after 20m) take the first one to the LEFT
and you will see the partyplace indicated :)


Another way to remember this is to follow all the CRISTAL signs (that's a
Belgian Beer). It is a red plate with a white sign. At the station of Hasselt,
there is this pub with a Cristal sign, go into that street (F. Massystraat),
go to the left, until you come across another cristal sign (Lazarijsstraat).
Enter it, after 20m take the first to the right until you get at another Cristal
sign, the partyplace! :)))


                                The cash stuff
                               ----------------

Entrance fee will be set at 350 BEF (Belgian francs) per person, we only
accept belgian francs. If you really insist you can also pay in other
currencies, but keep in mind that the exchange rates are not our means
of mesure - you will pay more if you pay in other currencies!

Girls get free entrance ofcourse!

Just to give you an idea of how much 350 BEF is, here is a list with
exchange rates (we will NOT use the following list for entrance fee
money!)

 350 BEF        =       $10 or DM 18 or Fl. 20 or 60 FF
 250 BEF        =       $7 or DM 11 or Fl. 15 or 45 FF

If you want to pay in advance, no problem..  The price then is 250 BEF
(Belgian francs, same stuff as above) per person. If you pay in advance,
your money will not be refunded if you don't show up at the party, sorry.
Also no change on advance payments.

You can mail the money to:
PO BOX 25
3000 LEUVEN 3
Belgium.

With the cash send your 'password'.  We'll ask you for it at the entrance
if you claim to have payed in advance. If someone else knew about your
password and got in with your money before you..  tuff luck. Better find
the dude and kill him (OUTSIDE the party-place please !). Also add your
first name and handle please

And ofcourse if you dont like the Belgian postal service, you can use a
bank-transfer too..  The account-number is 330-0201835-32. In the message
put your handle, real name and password.

                                  ---------------

The partyplace is a recently constructed building and has all modern
means of comfort. A seperate sleeping hall in the complex is provided
(and it *IS* isolated & silent!). Toilets and stuff are also nice and
clean. Too bad there aren't any showers in the complex.

Inside the party place a bar will be available with all kinds of drinks
(beer -taste the real and only Belgian beers-, water, coke, etc.) at
CHEAP prizes <see further>. You will also be able to buy some sandwiches
over there for the same price of a drink (read: CHEAP FOOD :)

At the partyplace, all foods & drinks are the same price: you get 3
consumptions (whether it is beer, coke or food) for 100 BEF.

You are at about 5 mins from the main center of Hasselt, which
has LOTS of pubs, snack bars, also at very acceptable prices (but not as
cheap as in the partyplace :). and for all you party freaks:
The biggest disco from the region is at a 10 mins walk or 2 mins drive :))

A helpdesk will be available 24/24. If there are any problems, you can
easily ask your questions there!

And to make it clear for the first and last time : There will be
@{b}NO Cybercafe@{b} of any way and certainly @{b}NO party-network@{ub}.
Ofcourse you are totally free to set up those things yourself and
we wont be mad for it, but its something we dont have the time
and cash for to organise...

                                Some final notes
                               ------------------

Please keep these things in mind when you're at the party :

- The party-place is located on a piece of land called BELGIUM, this
  means that @{b}all Belgian laws apply inside and outside@{ub} of the party-place.

- It's a LEGAL party.

- All the hardware that you bring is at @{b}YOUR responsibility@{ub}, dont come
  and cry to the organizers if it gets broken/stolen/whatever.

- Troublemakers will be thrown out or even be handed over to the police.

- If you're too intoxicated (read drunk/stoned/...) you will be denied
  entrance to the party-place until you are decent again.

- @{b}If you make a mess of the party-place or the neighbourhood, YOU clean it
  up and pay ANY damage.@{ub} We'll have people patrolling the partyplace at
  every time of the day!

- If you damage something, YOU pay for it.  No cash ? Don't worry,
  we'll call your parents.

- The organizers have to be seen as almighty gods and their word is law
  in the partyplace. If you wanna play smart, meet mr. baseball-bat! :)

Ofcourse you are able to reserve a number of seats at the party-place. You are
strongly encouraged to reserve your seats when you are sure you are coming to
the party. we don't want to have people arriving at the partyplace when there
are no more seats left!

You can reserve your seats by writing a simple mail to @{" the organizers " link "contav34"} with
the following contents:
        - Your handle / first name
        - The number of seats you wish to reserve
        - The number of computers you are bringing (and preferably the model)

An example email could be:
        - Name  : Crisp
        - Seats : 5
        - Compus: 3 A1200, 2 A4000.

That's it!

If you want to pay in advance, feel free to send us the reservation sheet by
postal services. You can include the money over there or you can use a bank
account. You can also send us an email with the number of reservations and
send us the money afterwards. Please don't forget to add your password to both
the email and the money, since we won't be able to smell where it came from ;).
