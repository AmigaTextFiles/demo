    In the firm belief that it is
 still possible to gain new contacts
  interested in some friendly, lazy
  swapping, CURT COOL/DEpTH decided
 to send this advert to a wide range
  of more or less famous amiga scene
   diskmagazines. This is what you
  have to do: Send a good letter to
  this adress, and expect an answer
            a while later:

 Frank E. Larsen, Stolpegrdsv. 35,st3
        2820 Gentofte, Denmark

     If you happen to be a module
   afficionado, modulist/composer,
     interested in supporting the
 Eurochart, or just inventor of a new
 machine which will clean up my flat
     by itself, write me as well.
