                     AMIGAnica HUNgarica CONference #1

                   "This will end your windows session!"

            Attention, all cosmopolitan computer fan on globe!

             I'd like to announce to you news, that hopefully
                   is going to make your heart beating!

             The very first pure AMIGA (rather PC-FREE) party
                          held in Hungary is here!

     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 We've really felt the need for such a party & conference already, because
 the Hungarian & Foreign gatherings don't seems to be tending upgrade and
 it rather stands for the usual attendents now.
 I guess quite a few of us loose the motivation for going to such events,
 when (in good instance) at every second table only, poor teens wander 
 about  an ugly 3D murder-world.

 The organizers mustn't be blamed for this, they must win the money somehow,
 for the hall-rent's, projector's and the rest "triffles" cost. To
 achieve this is really enough the gang of those neoprimitive, conceited,
 assface, who paid the entrance fee in order to get everybody see his
 lightspeed wreck-heap.

 The AMIGAnica HUNgarica is a party, where the organizers guarantee, no
 Microsoft creatures, nor doom/quake/duke/etc. clones are going to use
 processortime. The only exception out of these, if the above mentioned
 mnemonicgroups are running in EMULATOR as test event.

 The computers are allowed at AMIGAnica HUNgarica must belong to alternative
 type with the label of Commodore, AMIGA, Sinclair, Apple or Silicon.
 Shoddyboxes (PC's) are let in by prearrangement only, and its function is
 limited to having it MAXIMUM as network-router! (otherwise it must be
 handled to the organizers for "COMPO-MACHINE" ;))

 The hall itself can give trenches for quite a few hundreds of fugitives only,
 running away from the XX. century computer slough (wintel), thus the number
 of visitors are limited! Though i don't think thousands of people are needed
 for a rather friendly atmosphered meeting.
 Not the megawatts, megahertz, megasoftwarecompanies play the lead at this
 party, but the competitions and all the more rather the people contributing
 there.

 Why the word "conference" next to the party?
 Because it's the first AMIGA scene & Computer Club conference, where
 those are involved can talk their opinions, experiences and their future
 plans over, and not at last they can meet their "rivalry" face-to-face.

             and handle the first wing-beats of our alternative
             computing in front of the misinformed millions.
             That's why we are really in need of You, Sceners,
