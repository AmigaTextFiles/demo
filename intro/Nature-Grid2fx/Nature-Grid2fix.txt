	We are Nature.
	In this archive you'll find a fixed version of our 64k-intro
        called 'Grid 2'. To be 100% safe we also included the uncrunched
	version. Try that if the crunched version fails for some reason.


Requirements:
	AGA, 68020, FPU, 12Mb fast


Recommended:
	68060 (with FPU), Oxypatcher, Speedychip


Tested on:
	A1200/Blizzard1230/FPU/50mhz
	A1200/Apollo1260/66mhz


Information:
	This production was released at 'The Party 2000' in Aars, Denmark.
	It's a sequel to our 40k-intro called 'Grid' (!), which won the 
	german party Mekka&Symposium, in the year of 1999.

	If you use 'Oxypatcher' (or similar patch),  things will
	be much faster, especially the precalculation.
