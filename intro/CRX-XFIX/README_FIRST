 
 What a shame... the CRUX x-mas intro does not work on Amigas
 without FAST RAM! I (Grey) am terribly sorry for this...
 
 To fix this problem, copy the files "CRX-XMAS.pch" and
 "Patch_Intro" to the same directory as the intro
 ("CRX-XMAS.exe") and execute the script ("Patch_Intro")
 there. If you don't have "GPatch", copy it to "C:", also the
 "Protect" command should be there...
 
 Thanks must got to Erik 'Cybergod' Ericsson for pointing
 out the problem and to Ralf Gruner for his wonderful GPatch!
