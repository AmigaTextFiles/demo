                                 ----------------  YALP99 preinvitation

---( plAce )--------- --- -- - -  -    -  - - -- --- ---------[ Yalp'99 ]---

  We have a new  partyplace, it's no longer  the Fest. It's  much nicer, but
  it's awfully  hard to  explain how to get  there, so let's not  bother you
  with it until the final invitation.


---( tiMe )---------- --- -- - -  -    -  - - -- --- ---------[ Yalp'99 ]---

  Looks  like the  Yalps are doomed (except  the worse  ones, that happen in
  years divisible by 666)  to happen close in time to the Scene  Strikes. We
  will try to  get them as far from each  other as possible, Yalp'99 will be
  held in  the second half of  January. It will most  probably last only one
  day.


---( compOs )-------- --- -- - -  -    -  - - -- --- ---------[ Yalp'99 ]---

  PC demo - As usual, animations are allowed (if you're  not too embarrassed
            to use them) and the demo can't exceed 8 megs in size.

  Amiga demo - Same  as  PC  demo, except  the  obvious  difference  in  the
               machine.

  PC intro - Max. 64k.  Intros are  traditionally  the weakest  category, so
             feel free to bring anything  shorter that 64k (even 4k intros.)

  Amiga intro - 64k max, too.

  C64 demo - Does anyone still make this sort of thing around here? Max. two
             full disks.

  4ch - Only .MOD format, max. 700k, only the  first 3 minutes of the module
        will be played. They'll be played on either PC or Amiga.

  Multichannel - They'll  be played in  Cubic Player on PC and HiP on Amiga,
                 so you better use some format they can read. Max. 1 meg and
                 only the first 3 minutes will be played.

  C64 music - Must be executable, only the first 3 minutes will be played.

  Pixel - Up to 640x512 in 256 boja.

  C64 pixel - If there's  only one or  two, they go together  with the other
              pixel entries. They too must be executable.

  Raytrace - Only pure raytrace, no photoshopping or  anything. Fractals and
             other program-generated pictures are still welcome.

  24bit gfx - The former  Photoshop compo. Do it in any program, but keep in
              mind  that we want  real art.  Scans  and grabs  will  be dis-
              qualified.  The entries in all gfx categories will be shown on
              both Amiga and PC (except C64 pixel, for hairsplitters.)

  256byte megademo - We only count on PC megademos, but it  would be nice if
                     you'd surprise us with something else. Just let us know
                     ahead.

  Ascii - They'll  only be shown on  Amiga, except if  you overwhelm us with
          requests for them being shown on PC too.

  Useless utility - You'll have to demonstrate it yourself (unless it really
                    needs no interaction).

  Wild/animation - "Wild" generally  includes all  kinds of  slideshows  and
                   "exe" animations, if you're planning anything more exotic
                   (or anything above 1gb) let us know ahead.

  If there are  really too many  modules, we'll have  preselect a reasonable
  number of the best and  play only those, to  avoid boring people to death.
  In  other compos this won't be  done, but totally idiotic  entries will be
  eliminated regardless  of the compo they' re in  and the  total number  of
  entries.

---( compo machiNes ) --- -- - -  -    -  - - -- --- ---------[ Yalp'99 ]---

  PC - P2/233  (yes, we  could have got  a faster one,  but it  wouldn't  be
       appropriate for a demo party) 128m RAM, Tseng ET6000, GUS 1m

  Amiga - A1200, Blizzard PPC603/060, 32m Fast RAM..

  C64 - PAL VIC, new SID, 1541-II

  Why are you interested in prizes, isn't it enough to participate ;)

  You know  it's not very wise  to promise exact  prizes in  advance, but we
  promise that among other things one real computer will be awarded (no, not
  a C64)


---( improvEments )-- --- -- - -  -    -  - - -- --- ---------[ Yalp'99 ]---

  In  cooperation  with  NASA experts,  we' ve discovered  a new  method  of
  starting  compos real soon after the deadlines.  So this time nothing will
  be late.
