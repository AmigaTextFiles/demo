This is an Amiga version of the famous "Badger Badger Badger" dance.
You can download the original version of this cool intro at the URL
http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com. The AmigaOS and MorphOS versions
were done by Mr.X of Barracuda by  using the new amazing Multimedia
Application Layer  "Hollywood" by  Andreas Falkenhahn. Please visit
his web page at http://www.airsoftsoftwair.com.

Lyrics and a wallpaper are also included for more badger fun.

Please note that this dance is most likely too slow on 68k  Amigas.
The 68k version is only included  for use on emulators like WinUAE.
The MorphOS version should be fast enough on Pegasos. A version for
AmigaOS4 is also included now.


WRONG TIMING!!! WHAT CAN I DO?
==============================
There's a file called timing.txt in this directory. Open it with
your favorite text editor and modify the number in it. Default is
335. Try to add or subtract 10 or 20 and see if the timing gets
better.
