About Source
------------
I use this intro infront demos in my scene demo collection, like a
cracktro infront of a game hehehe. I release this source as freeware
source and you can do anything with it. If you do use it or like it
i would be happy if you mention my name, but it's not a demand. Anyway
the code is empty of comments and it's not fully relocatable, just the
PT-replayer is fixed, and it shouln't be to hard to fix it. The intro
does not like the VBR to be moved anywhere.
