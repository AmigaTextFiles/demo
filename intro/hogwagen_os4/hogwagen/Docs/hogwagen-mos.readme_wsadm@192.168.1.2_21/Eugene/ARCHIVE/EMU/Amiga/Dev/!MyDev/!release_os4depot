Lollipop hogwagen - tonic's entry to #demoscene 4k source compo.
(Mar 2003)

I started a bit late with putting it together, so I had to take
some old effect and just modify it a bit for the compo. I also put
some music-like noise to background as well, which is based on a
composition by Tense. I ran out of time, so I didn't put any more
stuff in it, even I still had plenty of space within the size
limits.

Note from porting author: Unlike commonly accepted in the demoscene the 4kb this time
 refers to the size of the source code instead of the executable. Indeed this an entry
  from the 4 k source 2003 contest held by the irc channel #demoscene.
