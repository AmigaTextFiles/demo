developing instructions

1. intro compiling

 - get devpac
 - check presence of the standard system includes
 - load "!main_17.s"
 - turn optimizations on or off
 - make sure cMODE definition is set to RUN or DEBUG
 - check PATTERNS definition according to the dbm2cron results
   (if you are converting new musiñ)
 - assemble to executable file 
 - run and enjoy

2. intro packing

 - set cMODE to PACK
 - turn off any devpac debug features
 - compile to executable file
 - rename "!main_17" to "!main.bin"
 - by using ced remove first 32 bytes of "!main.bin"
 - remove everything starting from word "end!" till end (including this word itself!)
 - save the result
 - run "4kpack" from CLI in the same directory
 - insert 'maxcode' value into "!depack7.s" (D_MAXCODE)
 - select packer optimization (D_OPTIMIZE)
 - turn off any devpac debug features and optimizations
 - compile "!depack7.s" to "!devpack" - your new packed intro! :-)

3. new muz converting

 - use only those five samples in example music file ("quit.DBM")
 - execute "dbm2cron <yourmusic.DBM> <yourmusic.BIN>"
 - remember number of patterns ("CRON - patterns")
 - replace 'incbin "muza1.bin"' in "!main_17.s" with incbin of your <yourmusic.BIN>
 - change PATTERNS definition according to the remembered number of patterns.
 - now you are ready to compile intro with your new music!
