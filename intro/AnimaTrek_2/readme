Installation: 
-----------------
For installation of AnimaTrek2 decrunch the file AnimaTrek2.lha in a directory 
called AnimaTrek2 in Dh1 or Hd1. From AnimaTrek2.lha come out some 
directories. The english version is in english directory and inside there are two 
executable icons, a AnimaTrek2-V1(eng) for hard drives with partition called dh1 
and AnimaTrek2-V2(eng) for hard drives with partition called hd1. You will execute 
AnimaTrek2-V1 if your partition of hard drive is called dh1, and you will execute 
AnimaTrek2-V2 if your partition of hard drive is called hd1. No more.
Lha is a ShareWare and it is in Aminet.
If you are spanish or you speak spanish, go to the español (spanish) directory or

Test:
------
The animation has been created in a A1200 with 030 MTec accelerator (42 Mhz), 2 
Gb Hard Drive, 10 Mb of RAM, a 4x Atapi CD-ROM. It run in any Amiga with 3 
Mb (Chip+Fast) or more. It has been tested in three A1200, three A500, and one 
A600, and it runned in any Amiga with 3 Mb or more. It will not run if you 
have'nt a Amiga with 3 Mb or more, or if you have a A500 with 3.1 ROM 
(Commodore problems).
The speed in a A500 is ok but it can to be that the music stop for some seconds.
I want suggestions for the future productions.
