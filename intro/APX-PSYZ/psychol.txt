 Some time ago Flapjack was known for his great Psychol chip-pack series,
which 13 issues were released under Convex, Erotic Design and finally 
Appendix label. In the middle of 1998 author decreased his activities
towards the amiga scene due to his studies. Now, although nobody ever
expected it, it looks like he is back to bring you totally new Psychol 
with marvellous graphics, improved, system friendly code and - as always - 
bunch of excellent chip modules. 
Appendix has already started working on issue 14 that is going to be
released by the end of this year. Player will support following
formats: MOD, THX/AHX, DBM, XM. So, if you feel like you have some
fresh chip tunes and you would like to see them in Psychol drop them
at the email mentioned below or contact anyone from Appendix team.
We are looking forward to seeing you supporting us! Take care and stay
tuned as we will get back much sooner than you expect.

The intro you have just watched (or you are about to) tells the
whole story you can read in this crappy text file. It is not supposed
to be a part of any competition during the party. Some might find it
a bit to simple and poor but it was done just to show you the idea
is real and the release date is really soon!  

Hey, don not forget to run setpatch before you try to see the intro.
Also remember the desired resolution is something about 320*256.
