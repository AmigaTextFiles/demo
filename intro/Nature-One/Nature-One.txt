| Requirements
`---------------

Hardware requirements: AGA, 020+, FPU, 8 MB fastmem
 - Only viewable on 060 though, too much muls and fpu code :)
 - Run SetPatch before starting the intro


| Info
`-------

Use OxyPatcher for some speedup!

Tested on:
 - A1200/Blizzard1260

If the intro runs super slow (like 1 fps) try removing your PCMCIA card
Try the uncrunched exe if the normal one fails, which uses NatCracker =)

| Special thanks to
`--------------------

 Scicco/Scarab, for being an absolute friend met through the scene and
  for him always being helpful and friendly!

 Psycho/Loonies, for letting us use his optimized c2p in the developing
  system for ham8 effects. The developer system works with a system screen
  and our own c2p didn't work with the system on :)
