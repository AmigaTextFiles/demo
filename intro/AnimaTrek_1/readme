For installation of AnimaTrek1 decrunch the file AnimaTrek1.lha in a directory

directories. The english version is in english directory and inside there are two 
executable icons, a AnimaTrek1-V2(eng) for hard drives with partition called dh1

Test:
------
The animation has been created in a A1200 with 030 MTec accelerator (42 Mhz), 2 
Gb Hard Drive, 10 Mb of RAM, a 4x Atapi CD-ROM. It run in any Amiga with 2,5 
Mb (Chip+Fast) or more. It will run if you have a Amiga with 2 Mb and you run 
your Amiga without startup. It has been tested in three A1200, three A500, and 
one 
A600, and it runned in any Amiga with 2 Mb or more. It will not run if you 
have'nt a Amiga with 2 Mb or more, or if you have a A500 with 3.1 ROM 
(Commodore problems).
The speed in a A500 is ok.
I want suggestions for the future productions.
