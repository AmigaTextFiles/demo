- T.R.i.P. Project

This year DeathStar decided to make real italian demoscene's expectations,
organizing the first, real Italian Demo Party.

The chosen place is the new structure of fair of S. Giorgio del Sannio (BN), in
the South of Italy in the province of Benevento, near Naples.
This is the right place: there is space for 900 attenders, it is very simple
to reach (the place is really near the highway exit and it is perfectly connected
with the rest of Italy by trains or buses).

Party Place can offer you a high quality four-channels sound system and a
huge, hi-definition, megascreen. There will be a sleeping room and free showers.
There will be a party-network, games, RPG tournaments and live music. Remember:
no time for sleeping! ;)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Rulez:

BEHAVIOR:

  Everyone at trip must respect local law:
  in Italy all kinds of drugs are forbidden and software piracy is a crime.
  The organizers reserve the right to expel people whose behavior is annoying
  for the normal execution of the party. We expect people to have respect for
  the environment and for other people at the party.
  The entry is 25.000 italian lire (about 15$ - US dollars).

COMPO RULEZ:

  Everyone is allowed to take part in any number of different compos.
  One author can NOT appear twice in the same compo, even in co-productions.
  This means that if you decide to make a co-prod you can NOT also make your own
  personal prod. A partial exception to this are demos and intros: we allow
  two groups to release two different demos, even if some members appear
  in both groups: this is because the author of a demo/intro is considered
  to be the group, not a single person.
  You must be present at the party for getting the prize, anyway you can
  compete also without coming at the party: we will accept contributions
  sent by e-mail or snail-mail, but the authors will not receive any prize
  for that. In that case, the prizes will NOT be retained, but given to
  the other contestants who are at the party!
  For more info about this please contact trip@nigma.it.

DEADLINES:

  Contributions must be presented before the respective deadlines.
  After deadlines a list of the accepted products will be published.
  Authors will be able to test their productions on the compo machine.
  The organizers respect the work of the authors and will act to make
  everything work good.

OTHER RULEZ:

  Only unpublished material will be accepted.
  This means that if the contribution has been previously made available
  on public internet sites (ftp, www or others), on public BBS's,
  on public NewsGroups, or on publicly distributed CD-ROM's, it will be
  disqualified.
  

HOW TO COME TO TRIP:

- CAR

Coming by car i's very easy. If you come from A1 highway, Milano-Bologona-Firenze-
Roma-Napoli, go on towards Naples, as far as Caianello exit; from
there go on to Benevento (about 50 km) along the freeway. Instead
if you come from Adriatic Highway Bologna-Pescara-Termoli-Bari, exit at Termoli, so
go on towards Campobasso and after to Benevento.
Once arrived at Benevento go on straight taking the highway connection
to NA-BA and after about 10 Km exit at "S. Giorgio del Sannio".
From here go on to the center of the city,
turning left to the crossroad of the spur. Go on along the avenue and,
at the end of this, turn left.
Watch out: the party place is that BIG and LOW yello building.
Enter and park your car in the big, free parking area.
Here you are, enjoy! ;)

Anyway, if you have an internet connection you can visit T.R.i.P. page that
contains images of the party place and of the streets with arrows telling
you where to go!
The site is, of course:
http://www.nigma.it/trip

- TRAIN

You can see a time-table at http://www.nigma.it/trip otherwise you can consult
the FFSS server: http://www.fs-on-line.com.
Once arrived at Benevento station there will be a T.R.i.P. bus service, for free! ;)

JOIN TRIP:

Filling this form you can make a reservation for you and your group at the 
party. The reservation is FREE: it only helps organizers in order to have a
precise idea about which structures are to make available to guests'.
When you make your reservation we grant you a table and an electric plug.
In case you come at the party without making a reservation we will *try*
to arrange everything to work out right for you anyway.

Fill in this form (completely or partially) and send it to trip@nigma.it
