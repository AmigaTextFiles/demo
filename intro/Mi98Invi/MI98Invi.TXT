 * Breaking beer bottles outside the partyhall is ABSOLUTELY not acceptable
   as there are cars in the parkinglot.
 * If/when organizers run out of booze, we reserve the right to confiscate
   required amount of alcohol from visitors.

 Voting  system  will  different be this year.  Now you vote onto a votedisk
and  we  won't  take  the  disks  back.  You only bring your votedisk to the
infodesk  and  a  personal  keycode will be written on it.  We then read the
keycode  data  from  the disk and you get it back.  You can bring it as many
times as you want because votecounter updates your data and won't accept for
doubles

We  think  there'll be no problems.  Last years visitors knew how to behave!
Save  your destroying strength to PC-parties and everybody will have a jolly
good time.  Welcome to the Amiga paradise, on 26.-28.6.  1998!!!
