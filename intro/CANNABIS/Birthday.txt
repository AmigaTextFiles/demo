Did you know that Melon Dezign celebra-
tes her 2. birthday on the 20 october ??

Anyway now you do, and if you want to
celebrate this breathtaking event with
us, then come to our birthday party in
Roskilde, DK. You and approx. 888 ot-
hers are invited, and the celebration 
will take place from

    Tuesday the 19. October at 1010 CET

to  Thursday the 21. October at 1212 CET


This is not a big commercial happening
organized just to make money. This is a
Melon Dezign party organized only by
members of Melon Dezign. We don't sell
our souls to moneymakers just in order
to get a few free tickets!! 

This means that we do not offer all the
material stuff that some parties do, but
still, we've got what it takes. Besides,
50% of the main organizers behind The 
Party I in 1991 were Melon Dezign so 
don't think we haven't tried this
before.

- Room for about 888 people

- Big screen 600*400cm

  (you got the melon seal of guarantee

  to buy your necessaries (read: coke, 
  pizza and the like..)

  member to bring extension cords !!!!

  splattermovies.

  kilde will be available.

             COMPETITIONS:

Even though this a birthday party, there
will be competitions for demo, intro,
music and graphics.

Since AGA has been out for a year now,
we figured it was time to upgrade the
good old 1.3 1MB A500 into a brand new
3.0 2MB A1200 which will be used for all
competitions. However, we will announce
what kind of equipment is necessary to
to run the demo/intro in question and
also the size of the palette or module
in the music- and gfx-competition. This
way, everybody gets the best opportuni-
ties.

fiti writers.

This is how you get to The Birthday 
Party:


If you come to Copenhagen by plane or
boat, simply take a train to Roskilde.
(Will take 25-30 mins.)

DSB, the Danish railway company, has
cheaper prices both Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday, so don't hesitate !!

When you are on the train station in
Roskilde, get on bus 600S or 216 (they
leave all the time, so no need for fancy
party-busses). The ride will cost you 
9.50 dkk, just ask the driver to drop
you at the second stop on Herregaards-
vej. From here you will have to walk
approx. 100m, but don't worry, there
will be signs showing the way..

If you come by car, just get off the 
highway when you're in Roskilde. You
will then inevitably find Oestre Ring-
vej. Just follow Oestre Ringvej in the
"Himmelev" direction, and at some point
Oestre Ringvej will cross Herregaardsvej
This is where you make your left turn!
On Herregaardsvej, you turn left again
(there will be signs when you get this
far, so don't worry)...
