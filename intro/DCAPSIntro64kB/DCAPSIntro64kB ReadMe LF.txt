whassup folks! let dreamolers introduce themselves to the demoscene.
after wip releases on revision 2022 laffik is back with full flavour demo named phonk! and this little intro.
i am back to coding after 20 years long gap.
i put it away because i had calculated that my phong routine will not work in few fps even on 68060 100mhz.
also because debugging is a freaking tedious and disgrateful task. now i work in winuae. muuuuuch faster!
xtd said that even small mickeys are worth submitting. so the last year saw the first release from dreamolers.
later jazzcat asked if i would develop these two little productions a bit.
when elite asks you have to move your lazy but! you know what i mean? so the word became matter and here it goes...
two new entries of mine on revision 2023! it was a few nice months of coding. more goodies to come.
check out www.laffik.com for more releases and news.
nota bene phonk! is completely free of included 3d enviroments or animations or ai coding or freelancer ghost writing
or github or aminet or whatever else. only my pure brainism and handmade coding. unique nowadays as i can see...
it recalls oldskool art of coding of various routines from scratch.
before the time when 2d and 3d animation routines erased all the conception in area of effect coding and algorhytms.
who follows me with it? lets rework oldskool procedural demoscene!
what with the other folks from the group?
jaca after programming morphos moved to canada to code some game apps for kids.
cyran done vendetta on uni over automatics and robotics. though course!
the course that made me to leave studies and get involved in fights for survival in uk economic system... shiteasy...
there is also yanec and kenny hc.
however i am not sure if they would fancy to develop some prods at last since they declared their wish to join the group.
they got wifes and kids and no time for this nonsense...
by the way all the dreamolers dudes origin from torun in poland. torun is the city that gave copernicus to the world.
together with the revolutionibus orbium collestium. the publication that brang us the idea of heliocentric system.
condamned by church inquisition into hell and burned on haystack together with the author.
ah! yeah! the church said sorry...
sorry excuses everything!
innit?
scroll restarts!!!


A L L E R G E N   I N F O R M A T I O N:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Contains polen and nuts.
- Irritating for i's.
- SAMPLED MUSIC!!!! - Sample's playback without mechanical feedback of forces.
  No instruments, no music, just cruelly dictated oscillations pushed from
  an arrays to the speakers.
- Shade bobs may contain glooten
- Author and content are not butthead- nor sadist-friendly


P A R E N T A L   G U I D A N C E:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Intro pulls out to a daylight forgotten pages of history of catholic church and
lacks of respect to religious beliefs about haystack, inquisition and heresies.
Not recommended for believers due to insults of religious feelings.

If you believe that private hobbyist-coder know how to:
  - crack
  - hack
  - destroy your computer
  - invigilate your data
  - read what's behind someones' on a photographs
  - still your:
    - credit card details
    - savings
    - passwords
    - lists of contacts
    - selfies
    - addresses
  - control traffic, buses, trams, tube and trains
  - control your mind (cybertelepathy)
  - control wallstreet, government, t-bet, spaceflights and your e-mails
  - control the eye

then you are delusional and uneducated, even though, or especially because
of that, your fears are taken even more seriously by social service agents.
You have full right to be an idiot, and feel safe even though.
Regardless to what you'll develop. And let the wiseheads work out prooves
for their legal clarity themselves. Even if this way you're breaking lives
of intelligentsia and simply slander or order to lynch and torture.
Not all the folks on earth are having black or white eyes. Not yet.
