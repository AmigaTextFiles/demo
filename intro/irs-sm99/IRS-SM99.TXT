                                1999!!



                                 WHY
                                 ---

Why not? This party is exclusively for the Amiga, and it tries to be a cozy
little event, where you can meet friends, compete with them, booze, have a
good time, etc. In short, it's a party of a kind that's not around much
anymore, the good old "copyparty" kind of party. If everyone has an
enjoyable time at SM, we'll be happy, there's no hidden commercial interest
in this, no sponsors, no internet and NO PC's!! It's for the Amiga and more
specifically, for the Amiga scene. 

SM has been held 3 times already, which might surprise you, if you haven't
really heard about it. Well, 3 years ago, it started out really small, and
then grew, if not in numbers, then in popularity. Now, we're finally
finished with the preparations for the Scene Meeting 99', to take place in
the summer, since there's no other (Amiga) summerparty in DK anymore. We
hope to make this a tradition in the future, and we aim to be a place where
the poor Amiga owner can come and feel secure in the knowledge that the big,
cruel, evil, PC world won't be coming here. A sort of safehaven for Amiga
enthusiasm :) We will have all kinds of competitions, centered around our
beloved platform, and if you feel there's something lacking, you're free to
tell this to any of the organizers, and we'll see what we can do to fullfill
your wishes (sorry, no homo-sexualilty with ME atleast, find somebody else
DEPTH ;))


                             WHEN&WHERE
                             ----------

The party is going to be held in a place called "Thomas B. Thriges Skole", which 
is located near the university of Odense, the 3rd largest town in Denmark. It
is going to take place from Friday the 9th July at 10.00 to sunday the 11th
July at around 12.00. We have managed (finally!) to get hold of some quite
small partyhouse thingie, and our only problem would have to be that it's
probably TOO small ;) The address of the place is: 

Thomas B. Thrige Kollegiet
Munkebjergvænget 4
5230 Odense M
Denmark (ehh? ;))

And here's some info about how best to get there :)

HOW TO REACH SM BY CAR:

Yep, this is actually not very hard. Follow the motorhighway to Odense.
Drive into Odense at "Odense C", you should see a McD on your left hand if
you come from "Jylland", or right if you come from "Sjælland". Follow
the "Odense Centrum" sign, which will direct you to drive past the McD..
Drive straight ahead, passing 1 roundabout and 2 traffic lights. Then, when
the 3rd traffic light appears, you should see a huge building called "Odense
Teknikum" to your right. Turn right here, drive straight past another
trafficlight, and then turn right at the next trafficlight. Turn right again
and then left.. You should now be inside a small compound with a red
building and surrounded by trees. This is it! 

HOW TO REACH SM BY TRAIN:

Århus - Odense

Departing from Århus:      08:02, 09:02, 10:02, 11:02, 12:02, 13:02, etc. 
Arriving in Odense:        09:45, 10:45, 11:45, 12:45, 13:45, 14:45, etc.

Copenhagen - Odense

Departing from Copenhagen: 09:00, 09:30, 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, 11.30, etc. 
Arriving in Odense:        10:29, 11:02, 11:29, 12:02, 12:29, 13.02, etc. 

TAKING A BUS FROM THE TRAINSTATION:

This is actually quite easy... Any bus with the number 21 will stop 20m
from the partyplace. sometimes the nice busdrivers announce the name of the 
next stop, and sometimes they don't, heh. So, tell him to drop you off at the
"Thomas B. Thrige's Kollegium" if he doesn't. If lost, just scream ;) 

And right here we must not forget to send out a huge THANK YOU to
Jemo/Agravedict, for actually getting this place for us :)


                             INFO&RULES
                             ----------

The schedule for the events will be shown at the party, but we'll make sure
there's (more or less) plenty of stuff for you to see on the bigscreen. That
stuff will ofcourse be Amiga only, meaning new demos, old demos, games,
SCALA, ehrr.. MPG's of Bill Gates getting assaulted with cakes, etc., you
know the score :) Apart from that, we might feature some special surprise
competitions, but otherwise, it's pretty much up to you alone to have a good
time, chat to eachother, meet new people, make something for the
competitions, booze a bit, explore the town, gatecrash a party and bring
some chicks back with you (infact, that might become a competition ;)),
etc.. There won't be featured any network or internet facilities, because
frankly, we (or is that only me? No matter, I'm the dictator ;)) think that
those 2 things, along with PC lamers and commercial sponsoring, are the 
mainthings responsible for ruining the special old party-atmosphere we
experienced once upon a time. But don't be afraid that we'll smash your
Amiga if we find that there's a parallel cable connecting your computer with
another Amiga though ;) 

A word about facilities. Except for the inside facilities at the partyplace,
like electricity (wow, eh?), sound&bigscreen, toilets, other sceners,
Amiga's, competitions, fun, etc., there's ofcourse also a town outside of
the partyplace, for you who'd like to show you're not only computer-nerds
(yeah sure, as if we'd believe that ;)). Infact it's the 3rd biggest town in
Denmark, which does say something atleast. Darkhawk would be quite willing
to be your tourguide in the nightlife of Odense, if you cover ALL of his
expenses, haha.. Ehrr, but Odense has everything you'd likely be needing,
and more. Not far from the partyplace, the biggest marketscenter in the city
is located, it has everything, cinema, McD, stores, etc.. A bit closer by
there is a supermarket for those of you who have to walk. For getting into the
wild nightlife in Odense, you'd better take a bus though, as it's a quite long walk
otherwise. However, Odense got it all, food, beer, sex, drugs, senseless
violence, gangs, etc.. You'll feel right at home! And hey! While the SM last
year was fun too, there was a really big problem with the location.. There
was no McD!! (arghh) In Odense, we have 5 McD's! Yes, we must be a truly
cosmopolitan city, eh? 

Now over to the entrance fee for this SM.. Last year it was all for
free as you know, we spent all of our money to please you.. That was, as I
wrote in my last party invitation, just a poor commercial trick to make you
attend, and NOW, we strike back with really huge, capitalistic entrance
prices.. Here they come: 

Entrancefee for most people:                             50Dkr
Entrancefee for IRIS'ers:                                 0Dkr
Entrancefee for those helping the day before the party:   0Dkr

Yes as you can see, you can either be a lazy IRIS'er, or some poor
hardworking guy who has to move around a lot of tables, otherwise we're
afraid that you just have to pay this exceedingly high entrancefee upon
entering the partyplace...

We'll be showing demos and stuff on the bigscreen now and then, when we
feel like it, and there's nothing else going on. If you hate the scene
and demos (that includes really OLD demos too, hehe), DON'T ATTEND!! :) 
And, if you feel like you have something special to show, a video, a 
production, anything, then don't be afraid to ask us about showing it,
although we will recquire some money to actually show it.. EHRR.. 

And as for sleepingspace.. Well, we should be able to locate a seperate
sleeping room for you who don't want to sleep in the partyhall, and IRIS'ers
will ofcourse each get one room with bed, etc., that goes without saying ;)

Here are some addresses of the mainorganizer in case you want more info:

Now you should have a good chance to get in touch with me. Feel free to use
the phone 24hours a day, BUT if you wake me, I can guarantee that you won't
win any prizes at SM, no matter how good your entry is, heeeheeeeheh.. 

THE RULES:

Mostly, our rules are infact things you MAY do on the party, but ofcourse we
also have some quite common rules. Atleast they're common for SM. The first
rule is especially important, don't think you have a chance in hell of
violating that one, heh:

1. You may NOT, NAADA, IKKE, NICHT, ETC. bring ANY COMPUTER having 
   affilation to the PC. That INCLUDES laptops. We have warned you! We DON'T 
   want to look at ANY PC!

2. Hmm, a boring rule: You may not damage anything at the place.. If you
   do, pay for it or die! 

3. Drinking inside is allowed! (atleast we say so, heh) But please,
   don't leave a mess, that's all we ask :)

4. If you puke ANYWHERE in the place, two organizers will use YOU to clean
   up the mess (if you understand...)

5. And smoking is not allowed inside the party building! So all you poor,
   soon to be cancer patients, please smoke outside ;)

That's it.. That isn't too bad, is it? Please follow those simple rules,
crack, copy, fuck, etc., as you like, but follow those rules! (pretty
please?).. That includes you too --> DEPTH <-- !!! ;)

And, remember: 
                THIS PARTY IS FOR THE AMIGA SCENE!

             (but other Amiga owners are welcome too)


                            COMPETITIONS
                            ------------

For all competitions we will use an Amiga 4060, 50mhz and ENOUGH fastram, to 
show the various things, but the things MUST be able to run at the specified
minimumconfiguration stated in the various compo's coming up. Else you can't
compete.. And you have to be at the party to get the prizes. If you aren't,
but you win, you'll still have the honour of winning, but the money will be
passed down amongst those actually present.. For competing without
attending, email the entries to Darkhawk friday morning 08.00 at the latest!

 AMIGA DEMO
 ----------
 
 Must not exceed 5mb of packed size. Must run from progdir: without
 assigns. Will be shown to the end, not including reading a 4 hour 
 long scroller. Must work on an Amiga 1200 with a 50mhz 030'er, FPU and 
 8mb of FastRAM.
 
 AMIGA INTRO
 -----------

 Will be held with 2 or more intros, but then there WON'T be
 prizes for all 3 entries, heh. They must be able to run on an
 Amiga 1200 with a 50mhz 030'er, FPU and 8 mb of FastRAM. The size 
 limit is 40k, NOT 64k.. Make a demo instead, if you have a 64k intro 
 ready ;)

 4 CHANNEL MUSIC COMPETITON
 --------------------------

 This is your standard, run of the mill Protracker module
 compo. Modules up to 880k UNpacked are allowed, the tune will 
 be played for 5 minutes, if too many entries are delivered, a 
 quite competent jury will be selected to bring down the number 
 of competing modules to 15. Ofcourse only one module for each 
 musician.

 GRAPHICS COMPETITION
 --------------------

 Only iff pictures accepted, NO raytracings (see the raytracing
 compo later), clearly digitized/scanned pictures will be
 disqualified, drawn copies are ok though. Only one picture per 
 graphician.

 BEST RAYTRACING
 ---------------

 All formats will be displayed if possible. There'll only be one 
 "real" prize that is, but we might give the secondplace a beer
 or something like that too! ;)

 SURPRISE COMPO'S
 ----------------

 These will be held if we'll manage to come up with something
 out of the ordinary, but apart from that, we're open for
 suggestions, game tournaments, etc.. 

PRIZES
------

Ok, ofcourse we can't have a prize budget like TP, but we hope that
won't stop you from releasing a lot of cool things at SM, since it's the
competition with other groups and the opportunity to show your work that
should be important for the scene, not the money you get for it. That said,
there WILL be prizes, don't run away screaming now! Based on the money we
get from the entrancefee, minus unforeseen expenses (IRIS members boozing in
the pubs and such), we'll give each competition the following percentage of
money (we reserve our rights to change this, if there's not enough entries
in some competitions):

Amiga Demo:     50%
Amiga Intro:    25%
Amiga 4Channel: 12%
Amiga Graphics: 12%

Raytracing and Surprise compo's will get from another pool of ressources, 
that we have ready. Some of you might know what I'm talking about here, but
don't let that frighten you into not competing ;)

           That's it, that's all! Now attend damn you!
