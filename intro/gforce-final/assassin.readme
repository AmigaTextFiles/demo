Assassin library is a new compatibility library that is totally tag based.
We will start using assassin instead of backstab in the future productions.

Because I have to ponder about the logic of the library for some more time,
the library coming with the intro is not the full version. The full version
will be spread soon.

You may obtain the library when it is released from InterNet, for example
x2ftp.oulu.fi (programming site), and probably from Aminet.

Silver Eagle.
