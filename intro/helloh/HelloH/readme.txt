"Hello Hungary" (AmigaOS 4) - originally released at fYaNICA #12


Changes to the original version:

- ogg vorbis player (originally used amp)
- improved "flag effect"
- some fadings
- window mode (WINDOW=W parameter when starting)


Info:

- yes, running time is very short. I'm not sure if I should call this an intro or a demo ;)
- cool music by Restore2003 / Push Entertainment (thanks ToAks too :)
- tested to work OK on MicroA1-C ( ~45 FPS ). Probably needs 640*480*32 screenmode ;)
- thanks to COBRA who fixed the sound problem in the party version
