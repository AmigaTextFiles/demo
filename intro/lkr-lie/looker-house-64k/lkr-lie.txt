Last notes.
This intro was supposed to released at Assembly 97, but we missed
the deadline... Too bad, but anyway here is it going. Enlight is
very poor demo party, not Asm in anyway, but why not?
Released in August.23.f97... Sankt-Petersburgh...

P.S.
I missed word 'be' twice in intro texts. I did it for some reason.
If you're enough smart you'll get the intro idea.
