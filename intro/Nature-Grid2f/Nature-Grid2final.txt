	THIS IS THE FINAL VERSION OF 'GRID 2' WHICH FIXES THE 040 BUGS
	WITH TRASHED SOUND ETC.

We are Nature.
	In this archive you'll find the final version of our 64k-intro
	called 'Grid 2' that fixes the 040 bugs with trashed sound etc.
	To be 100% safe we also included the uncrunched version. Try that
	if the crunched version fails for some reason.

	A very big thanks to Psycho/Session that helped us very much
	when hunting down the strange 040 bug and also thanks to
	the help with our 040 test programs from these people:
	 - Slayer/Appendix
	 - Chip/Powerline
	 - Shin/LookerHouse
	 - Shape/DCS
	 - Thain


Requirements:
	AGA, 68020, FPU, 12Mb fast


Recommended:
	68060, Oxypatcher, Speedychip


Tested on:
	A1200/Blizzard1230/FPU/50mhz
	A1200/Apollo1240/40mhz
	A1200/Apollo1260/66mhz


Information:
	This production was released at 'The Party 2000' in Aars, Denmark.
	It's a sequel to our 40k-intro called 'Grid' (!), which won the 
	german party Mekka&Symposium, in the year of 1999.

	If you use 'Oxypatcher' (or similar patch),  things will
	be much faster, especially the precalculation.
