THE STORY

It was 25th November 2000, early evening, and the two of us, namely
what was left of Morbid Visions, were stuck in a car with three crazy guys,
driving fast toward Spoleto. Our fellow travellers were the gorgeous
Rocketeer, brilliant editor of the glorious magazine The Charts and two cool
friends, named Syncro and Marco, not yet involved in that crazy world called
the scene (we spent part of the trip explaining to Marco what demos are, what
makes Amiga a special computer, and what we were going to do that night). We
were bringing with us a lot of wine and a still warm floppy disk containing
our freshly assembled 64k intro, LaChopper! Though we had slept only a few
hours, we were overexcited by a more than 20 hours long deep-coding session.
Our target was Spoletium 3!

Spoletium was a small but very funny party. At that time, the Italian
scene had already lost many prominent players, but all those
who were still active joined the event and brought some productions.
There were members of Genesis, Darkage, Trinity, The Spookie
Fellows, Ram-Jam. More productions were submitted by email from
foreign sceners. People knew each other since several scene and
Amiga events, and many hours spent on IRC. The atmosphere was really
good, friendship ruled and wine was abundant. Some guys ;-) wanted
to organize a race-in-a-trolley compo, but Modem, afraid of
police, didn't reveal where trolleys could be stolen from!
Too bad!! When the 64k compo started, LaChopper was run on an A1200
equipped with a 68060. Although it didn't crash, many bugs came out
spoiling the show. Before the party, indeed, we had only tested LaChopper
on the development systems, which were an A1200/030/50 and an A4000/030/25.
Hopefully, Modem launched a second time the intro using a software
degrader. This time LaChopper performed a lot better. In spite of the bugs,
we won the 64k intro compo but we were a bit disappointed because it
was the first time that one of our productions had bugs so clear
and visible. So, while receiving the compo prize, we sincerely
promised to ourselves to immediately track down those bastards, smash
them and release a fixed LaChopper.

                     A BROKEN PROMISE !!

By the time we recovered from the drunkness, Modem had already released and
spread all party's contributions, including our bugged winning intro.
"So", we said, "the damage is done, there is no hurry to fix the bugs,
let's do that when we'll have more spare time!". You can image how the story
went. We got back to our lazy lifestyle, kept doing, from time to time,
some coding work on other stuff, and soon forgot about LaChopper.

That was typical Morbid Visions attitude. Our group was born between '94 and '95
with 10 people in the memberlist. Half of them never did anything scene
related! And the rest of us (including those who joined the group later)
was always too little productive. We stayed active from 1995 to 2001, and in
that time we completed and released six main productions. None of them had a
big impact on the scene, but we gained some notoriety, at least in the small
but nice Italian scene. After 2001, we lost interest in the Amiga scene,
as well as time to dedicate to it. Morbid Visions stopped all activities but
they were not declared dead.

But banging the hardware gives you special emotions, is incomparably more
thrilling and involving than any other programming experience. It is
impossible to forget, something you cannot stay without for long.
After some time, the one of us known as The Dark Coder joined Trinity and
came back in the stagnating Amiga world, while Deathbringer started a new
metal-bashing career on innovative, cutting-edge digital platforms.
The coding eagerness filled again our souls, bringing new ideas and projects
to work on. But we weren't completely free to comply with our wishes.
The shame of the buggy LaChopper was a regret entangled in our minds,
obstructing to cloudlessly pursue new projects. So, in 2005, we
decided to recover the old sources and fix LaChopper. Very soon, we
rediscovered the unique fun of Amiga metal-bashing. Then we decided to not
only fix bugs but also implement additional effects, graphics and ideas
we had planned during the early development of LaChopper but in the end
not realized for time restrictions or inability. We thought it was not fair
to name "fixed version" an intro rather different from the original
LaChopper. Hence we started working on two new "editions" of the intro.
The former, named LaChopper Fx, is meant to fix bugs of the original
edition otherwise being as similar as possible to it. The latter, named
LaChopper Dx, is a "deluxe" edition featuring the additional effects and
improved graphics and direction. On 1st July 2005, Codex Alpe Adria took
place in Udine. It was the year 2005 edition of an annual event dedicated to
various and "general" aspects of the Amiga world, as well as to retrocomputing
and new alternative computing platforms. For the first time, a small
demo-compo had been organized as part of Codex Alpe Adria. The effort of
organizing a demo-compo in Italy after many years of nothing, was admirable
and deserved support. Since the new LaChopper editions were not ready, we
decided to contribute with a "Trailer" of LaChopper Dx, quickly prepared.
Finally, 2006 arrived. According to our plans, we completed the new editions
on the 6th anniversary of the magical night we enjoyed in Spoleto. We released
LaChopper Dx at The Ultimate Meeting, which took place from 27th to 29th
December 2006. It was the first and the last time Morbid Visions attended an
international demo party. The very last blitz before we go.

On 25th November 2006, our chase to LaChopper bugs and to the regret
disturbing our mind is over. We have spent six years on the trail of the
ghost of our imperfection, like six are the years of Morbid Visions really
active life (1995-2001), and six are our main productions.
Six-six-six.

                    666, the number of Morbid Visions.

PRODUCTION INFO

LaChopper is a 64k intro. It is designed to run smoothly on an Amiga
with a 68030/50 CPU, but thanks to its Chunky-Copper technology,
it exhibits an enjoyable frame-rate also on slower systems, including the
plain A1200 with a 68020/14 CPU. The AGA chipset and 8M of Fast RAM are
required.

There exist 4 different editions of LaChopper, described below.

lachopper.futt't        63748 25-Nov-06 19:15:54   LaChopper Dx

The original edition was released on 25th November 2000 at Spoletium 3,
where reached the 1st place in the 64k intro compo. This edition has several
bugs in both code and graphics, especially visible when running on a 68060
equipped Amiga. It generally runs quite well on systems with a 68030 CPU.

The Trailer of LaChopper Dx is a special edition displaying only some static
screenshots of a preliminary version of LaChopper Dx. It was released
on 1st July 2005 at Codex Alpe Adria 2005.

The fixed edition, LaChopper Fx, features the same storyboard
and effects of the original edition but without bugs. Note that the visual
appearance is very similar but not exactly identical to the one of LaChopper
original edition because most of the bugs were in the frame-interpolation
routine, so fixing them caused small but unavoidable changes. Some of the
routines of LaChopper Fx are also faster than those in the original edition,
and as a result the fixed edition enjoys an higher frame rate, especially
on the plain A1200/020/14. It was completed on 25th November 2006.
It was released on 25th January 2007.

LaChopper Dx is the deluxe edition, featuring new effects and improved
graphics and direction. It was completed on 25th November 2006.
It was released at The Ultimate Meeting 2006, where reached the 6th place in
the combined 64k intro compo.

THE FUTURE

LaChopper Dx is the final work of Morbid Visions. There will be no more
productions from our group. Our long trip along the border between
the world of the living and the one of death will finish soon.
But the time is not come yet. Before vanishing in the dark, Morbid
Visions will release a couple of other bugfixes. Indeed some other
productions of ours have defects, too. Since we want to reach...
Zero Defects, we'll release fixed editions also for them. In these
other cases (in contrast with the LaChopper one) the bugs are rather
small, hence we hope that the fixing job will take less than 6 years!
;-)
