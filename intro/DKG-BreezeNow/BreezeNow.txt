			         NOTES:

Spoleto (Italy), 16 March 1999. It's late night, and I decided to start a
4kb intro for the cool polish party Astrosyn'99.  I used some routines by
my friend Dip/Darkage,  and  he agreed to let me insert his bytes in this
intro.  I hope that you'll like it!  Now it's late night  of  17th  March
1999, and I'm listening cool mp3s while writing this short piece of text.

A note... !!revo  si are nA daed si egakraD

If you're  smart  enough  to  understand  the  text  above,  you'll  have
something to write about in your diskmagazine.
