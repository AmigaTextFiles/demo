OOPS! :-)

 Look what happens when you don't have machines to test your code on...:)

 The G-Force OCS in the gforce-final package has a bug, because it
 still requires AGA :-). Require AGA in the meaning of checking chipset,
 nothing else.

 So we corrected the bug (changed one BYTE in the file :). Still, we
 haven't tested it on a >'020 OCS machine simply because we don't have
 access to one. We have tested it with 1200 in OCS mode (set from
 Early Startup).

 This version still needs the 'assassin.library' found in "gforce-final.lha"
 package can be found on
