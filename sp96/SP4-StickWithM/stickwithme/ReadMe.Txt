                        THE STORY OF MONGOLIAN PRODUCTION


It all started two years ago in a Mathematic Classroom. Jerome Karaban
noticed
stranges drawings Eric Khodja, his classroom mate, made on his notebook.
It was a silly character named Gowe who always had a stupid smile on his
face.

Jerome adopted the character and with his style made him even more
stupid look-like. The name of this character was called later Timothee
inspired by the mark of a famous shampoo (sic!).


Then, Jerome decided to make a demo with his character. For handle, he
choosed naturally Timothee and with the help of his brother made the
first Mongolian Production: Timothee - Love Your Hamster - who sure got
big laughs.


Eric decided to join the group after that and choosed Captain Iglo as
handle. Iglo helped with digitized stuffs and some silly ideas of design
and script.

1994 is an important year for MP, coz the release of the NO COMMENT DENTRO
was a huge success beyond expectations.

Now, MP has several projects which includes of course the NO COMMENT DEMO
but especially big surprises!
