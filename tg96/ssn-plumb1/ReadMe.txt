                             PLUMB by SESSION


                    -=====> The Gathering 96 <=====-


Code: Infant -  Graphics: Justin Case & Terrox - Music: Tomas & Psycho

Requirements
------------

Plumb doesn't need any fancy ram or accelarator cards, the only thing it
needs is an AGA machine, MC68000 or better and a harddisk with about 1,2mb
of free space.

Installation
------------

Just double-click on the installer icon; the script will handle the
installation. When finished, either run Plumb from it's icon or from DOS,
where you should first CD to the directory containg the installed files,
and then type "SSN-PLUMB.EXE". No assigns have to be made. If you want,
you can also install it by hand, by just unpacking all supplied archives
into one directory.

Yours,
