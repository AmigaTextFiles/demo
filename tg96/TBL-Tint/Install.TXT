Installer for the demo "TINT" by The Black Lotus


How to install.

	* Copy all the files into the SAME directory on your HD
	* Change dir to that directory and run INSTALL.EXE

	Now wait... The installer will first join the separate 
	files together into one LHa archive.. It will then 
	attempt to extract the LHa archive. If you don't have
	LHa in your current search path it won't extract the
	files (Then do this manually).

After installed. 

	To run TINT change to the demo dir and run TBL-TINT.EXE
