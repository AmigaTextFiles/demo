Hello. This is a patch to run tint/TBL well on a4000/040.
One problem was solved by me, Randy/Ram Jam, and others by Offa/TBL.
Hellos to all TBL'ers in #TBL (rodney, rubberduck...)
Dont' forget to read and SUPPORT showtime, our CHART MAG!

TBL sends a BIG thank you to Randy for helping us with a 040 fix.
Just copy the new files TBL-TINT.E03 and TBL-TINT.EXE over the old ones.
