Void presents a new "demo" for the Revision 2020
Online demo-party called "Monodon Monoceros".

The demo requires an Amiga with Kickstart 2.0+ or
better and at least 1 MB of RAM.

Due to time issues, there are a few bugs here and
there, but we hope to release a fixed version of
the demo sometime after the party.

To install and run the demo, unpack the archive
to a wanted location on your HD- or RAM-disk.
Then run the .EXE-file.
