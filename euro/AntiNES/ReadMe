This is the AntiNES demo by Epsilon.  It was supposed to be entered in the
Intro competition at the Party II, but for some unknow reason it wasn't.
Our Aussie member who was at the Party still hasn't called us, so I don't
know what the hell is going on.  Oh, well.  This is actually a fixed version.
It now supports the VBR and Work Bench startup.  See ya later!
