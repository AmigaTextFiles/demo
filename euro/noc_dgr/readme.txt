Some words from the authors:
----------------------------
This was a bit trickier than we first thought. We clearly overestimated the
accuracy of UAE and the capabilities of the 060 FPU. Turned out it was also 
very hard to find an Amiga with a 060 board - and that they are expensive...

Getting the basics up and running wasn't much of a problem - finalization 
however took quite a bit of time.

Due to the above we never came around to fully optimize the pipeline. Because
of this we have relied on line/polygon streaming for certain parts. 

However, this was really fun and we might very well do it again some time!

Note: The video is recorded from a Pc/Mac rendering at 50fps.
