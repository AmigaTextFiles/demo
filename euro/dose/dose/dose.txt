Installation

Requirements: 68020, AGA, harddisk, 8mb fast
Recommended:  68040/40mhz

Copy all the files to your hard disk. Files in the libs directory
should be copied to "libs:". CD to dose and start the demo by running
"dose". But don't forget to run setpatch! 

Oh, you can change the mixing frequency of the multichannel mod by
entering the mixfreq in the command line, for example "dose 15000".
The default mixing frequency is 20000 which could be a bit too much
for 030.



A few words from Aivo

I would like to thank Demolition organizer, Mikko Piironen for sending
me a written invitation thus making it possible to get a vacation from
the army for the weekend.

Also, very BIG Thank Yous to Freak/MC for lending me his 68060 powered
Amiga and Kalsu/AP for composing some very good piece of music.
Without their generous help this demo would never have been released in time.



One word from Freak

Thanks!
