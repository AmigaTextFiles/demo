; Here's what the programme is supposed to do...

; Dark grey background.
; Blue Stickman at top of the screen moving back and forth.
; Red Ghost under him moving in the opposite directions.

; That's it, no fancy multisprite stuff.

; Here's what I'm getting on a real 2600.

; Three copies of each sprite spread out vertically across the screen
; and black lines dividing the screen into 3rds.

; The sprites all do what I want them to, it's just that there's too damn
; many of them. And I don't know where these black lines are coming from.

; The image is very stable and the VBLANK and OVERSCAN are just knabbed from
; some other programmes of mine that work like a charm.

; I can't see anything in the screen kernal that could possibly cause this odd
; behaviour so either my 2600 or supercharger have gone wonky on me, or
; there's some really odd bug I just can't see. Here's the source code.
; Now it's a little speghetti right now because I was just sort of doing
; "stream of consciousness programming"...
