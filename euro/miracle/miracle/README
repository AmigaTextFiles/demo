Changes:

- main.c: added M_PI definition from newlib's math.h
- main.c: added waits to improve system's multitasking during play


Known issues:

- this demo is quite CPU intensive. I've compiled it with level 2 gcc
optimizations on a G4 cpu to make it run faster, let me know if you have any
problems on your system. Note that the windowed mode is faster than the
fullscren one.

- there seems to be a bug in the code when run in normal pixel fullscreen mode,
the palette is changed and it runs in 8 bit instead of 32.


To compile: run "make" in the cool_gfx, cool_mzz and vecsys directories, then
in the root one. 

Thanks to Fabio Ferriccioli/Quantum Leap for his useful tutorial on SDL.
