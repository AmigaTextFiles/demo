Gday!
This is one of those little readme.txt files that
seem to be really trendy nowadays!
Anyway, this one isn't advertising a BBS or
anything trivial like that. No, it actually
contains some very real and relevant information!
"What?" you may ask.
Well that's a good question, because once one
gets to waffling on like this for some time,
it can be easy to forget just why you wrote the
damn readme.txt file in the first place! Luckily
however, I haven't forgotten, and will now
enlighten you as to the very purpose of having
typed up this readme.txt file.
Ahem.
Ok, in a nutshell, the demo is fuckin big.
No, that's not entirely correct. I should say
the module is fuckin big, and as a result, you
wee lil 512k chip users may run into a couple
of memory problems. So, you will need to switch
off ALL externals, yes, all of them, and as an
added precaution, you had better boot off a
disk with a 60 character display, rather than
80, as this saves even more chip memory.
Those with 1 meg of chip or more needn't worry!
Thanx to Cliff for testing the demo.
