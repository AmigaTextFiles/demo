We worked hard to make this demo and many hours were spent for thinking
and coding these effects.

(There were snapshots our our earlier demo Voyage (made for The Fantasy
 Force and released at Byterapers Gathering in summer of 199?) in video,
 which we saw at MTV (Same one with loadsa effects from other demos too!).)

	This is a fileversion of Assembly'93 Amigademocompo winnerdemo by
				PYGMY PROJECTS.

This lha-package contains:

BKSTAB10.LHA  - Backstab.library by Sami Vaarala(Silver Eagle/Pygmy Projects)
EXTENSION     - Actual demo
README_FIRST! - This file


History: We made our demo as much OS-friendly, so that it could be run at
	 any machine. Actually the demo relased at Assembly could have been
	 one file, but because machine it was supposed to run at had not
	 enough memory, because of OS, so I made a huge object - file out
	 of it and stored it to disk and used trackdisk.device to load and
	 my own routine to reloc it.

	 This fileversion is actually nothing else but the same object file
	 and a little extra to handle AGA properly (namely
	 backstab.library!)

	 There are some minor bugs but because we can't find some of our
	 demo-sources, we can't correct them. Sorry for that!

	 This demo runs (should!) on any amiga with enough memory attached
	 to it. I'm not sure about the amounts, but lenght of the tune in
	 executable file is about 200k and it goes to CHIP-MEMORY.
	 Plus you need some more CHIP-mem (atleast 512k!) for demo to run.
	 Plus size of the executable - lenght of the tune.
	 This demo is meant for HardDrive users (like me and Silver Eagle!)
	 only and I suppose any HD-user have enough memory to run
	 this do. (I + SEG have Amiga 1200 + HD both)
