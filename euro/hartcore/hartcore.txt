Short: New Demo by E.T.
Hardware required: PAL Amiga with at least 1 MB memory
Desc: Demo with industrial techno soundtrack, lots of colors, animations,
vector gfx, shade bobs, etc. (it is only about two minutes long, but these
two minutes kick ass!!).
"Hartcore" would have been released at the BIG-WOC-Festival in Cologne in
November 1993, but the festival was cancelled. So I release it without a
demo competition, because I don't want to wait for the Party III in Aars.
