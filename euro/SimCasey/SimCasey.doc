				SimCasey v0.0

			a stupid program written by
			       Jim Allenspach
	      N© 1993. This program is in the public domain.

SUMMARY
	SimCasey is a small program that simulates a "long-distance
dedication", as made popular by the syndicated radio show American Top 40,
delivered by AT40 host Casey Kasem. Casey tends to repeat himself a lot,
like any professional DJ will, and most of what he says is quite odd. Leave
him alone, and he'll spout off for hours. (And possibly drive you nuts.)


PROGRAM SPECS
	This program was compiled using the SAS C compiler, under Workbench
1.3 (it should be compatible with 2.0'ers). The machine used was an Amiga
1000 with 2 meg of RAM.
	A quick note about memory: this program reads in a 300+K sound
file, and allocates a hefty 100K of chip memory for playing the sample (as
per the double-buffering examples in Amiga literature). It would be a Good
Thing if you ran this program on a machine that had at least 2 meg; it
hasn't been tested on anything less. You have been warned...


BACKGROUND

	"COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT IS YOUR BEST ENTERTAINMENT VALUE"
					- Negativland

	The California-based band Negativland released a single in the
summer of 1991. Titled "U2", it was based on the supergroup's song "I Still
Haven't Found What I'm Looking For", and made use of samples taken from not
just U2 stuff, but from a tape of out-takes of Casey Kasem recording
American Top 40.
	About two weeks after the single was released, Negativland and its
label, SST Records, were hit with a very large law suit by U2's label,
Island Records. Island contended that the planned market "flooding" of this
single, coinciding with the release of a U2 album (nowadays a difficult
thing to avoid), would "tarnish" U2's reputation and image. (???)
	As a result of this legal action, the single was recalled, and all
copies of the single (or at least all the ones that were recalled) were
destroyed. Apparently, Island didn't want *anyone* hearing this record.
	Once Casey Kasem got wind of the single, he made it known (through
his lawyers) that he absolutely forbids the record to be released, since it
includes ill-gotten samples from his AT40 program. Right now, he stands as
the main barrier between the single and the listening public. (Though there
are ways to surmount these obstacles; see below.)
	This program is an outgrowth from some sampler work I did with the
single in 1992. It is in the public domain, so you can do whatever you want
with it (if anything). All I ask is that if you pass the program to someone
else, keep the three files together in the same package.

	[ Summer 1993 update: Well, U2's reputation hasn't been marred in
the slightest by the "U2" single. They're still selling tons of records,
Casey Kasem is still alive & well, and SST continues to crank out lots of
music. Negativland, however, is still suffering, although they've been
aided enough to release a new album, "FREE". Like most lawsuits about
nothing much, the earth did not crack, the heavens were not rent asunder.
Heck, TEC Tones (Negativland's main distributor) has even been selling the 
"U2" single in its mail-order business. Has anything really changed? ]


THE FILES INCLUDED

	Simcasey	-- the SimCasey program
	Casey.raw	-- the raw sample file used by the program
	Simcasey.doc	-- this file

	Please keep these three files in the archive, if you decide to give
this program to someone else.


USING THE PROGRAM
	Place the files SimCasey and Casey.raw in the same directory
somewhere. From the CLI, type the command

	SIMCASEY

and press Return. If all goes well, a largish window will appear on the
screen, and the sample file will be loaded. (Please note that this will
take some time, since the file being loaded is 362,136 bytes long! In an
informal test, it took about 12 seconds to load in the file when both
program and sample were on the RAM: drive.)
	After the sample is loaded, Casey will begin a long-distance
dedication. When you get tired of him, click on the close gadget on the
window, and the program will abort.

	If you'd like to hear the full sample, complete and intact, there
is a provision in the code for playing it. Type the command

	SIMCASEY CASEY

and press Return. The program will load the sample, play it, then quit.

ONE WAY TO HEAR THE "U2" SINGLE
	Even though the Entertainment-Military Establishment has suppressed
the single, there is a way for you to hear the record in question.
	The Copyright Violation Squad, a division of the Aggressive School
of Cultural Workers, is making available tape copies of the "U2" single. To
obtain a copy, send $7.00 *in cash only* to:

	CVS
	2103 Harrison NW
	 suite 2101
	Olympia, WA  98502-2607

	Any profits will be donated anonymously to Negativland for their
legal defense fund.
	"U2" is also available from the Iowa chapter of the CVS, along with
John Oswald's "Plunderphonic" and "Rubaiyat" works. Send a C-100 tape for
all three, along with a self-addressed, sufficiently stamped return mailer 
(and an optional $1 donation) to:

	YAWN
	PO box 227
	Iowa City, IA 52244


BIBLIOGRAPHY

"The Letter U And The Numeral 2" -- Seeland Records (SEELAND 008)
	This is a booklet/CD package being marketed by Negativland's own
record label, Seeland Records. It contains all legal information pertinent
to the "U2" mess. Your local Cool Record Store[tm] should be able to
order a copy for you. [ Aha! SST has sued Negativland for publishing this
booklet, because it contains SST press releases and other publicly-known
info. Negativland promises to re-release the booklet in an updated version,
when and if they get permission to. ]

"Hit Men" -- Frederic Dannen
	This book is a serious look at the corporate record industry: how
it started, how it got corrupted, and how it creates hits. Dannen's tales
of the far-reaching power of record execs, their independent promoters that
ultimately force singles on (or off) the charts, and the ties between the
industry and organized crime make for very interesting reading for any fan
of rock music.

	Those interested in Negativland can order all of their releases 
except, of course, "U2") from Negativmailorderland, their mail-order
service. For information, write to:
