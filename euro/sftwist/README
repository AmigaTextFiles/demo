     This demo is based on the HOI AGA demo effect "My Fair Lady".
Not only is this version slightly faster than the HOI DEMO, it is also
programmed nicer.

     Rather than taking over the machine, pounding hardware, and forcing
you to boot with no startup... SilverFox's Twister (SFTwist) will
multitask in a draggable Intuition Screen and cause NO enforcer or
mungwall hits.  My demo also has more going on with a QIX running
around the screen and 3-d stars as well.

     Finally, all source code is included from the original C and ASM
to the ".h" and ".o" files for linking.  The demo was written in SAS/c
6.3 and CAPE 2.5 assembler.

     The demo can be run from either the workbench or CLI and will exit
when you press any key while the screen is activated (clicking the
mouse buttons will only blank the mouse).  Even though the demo
executable is very small, it requires a lot of memory to run (about
700 K) and therefore will only run on 1 meg machines.  When you first
run the demo, the 3-d stars will be absent until computations for
the rotation have finished.  You can monitor the computation progress
by the speed of the QIX.  After about 3 seconds on an '040 machine
or 15-20 seconds on a 1200, the demo will begin for real.

     The demo requires the freely distributable iff.library by
Christian Weber to run.  It is included in the archive.  By starting
the demo from the CLI with a single argument, you can load in your
own 320x200 1-bitplane graphic into the demo.  I suggest you try the
included picture "GIRL1.IFF" :)\<-8  (smiley beating off with his
left hand).
