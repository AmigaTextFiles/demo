   NAME
	ES -- EuroStars

   SYNOPSIS
	ES [MRS][XYZ] <value> [<value> ... ]
	ES B
	ES Q	(ARexx only)

   DESCRIPTION
	ES is a starfield program based on European code that has been
	massively cleaned up and featurized.  As a result, it doesn't run
	quite as smoothly on vanilla 68000-based systems, but it's less
	likely to trash your system.

	ES may be run from the command line or from the Workbench.  When
	you're finished looking, click the left mouse button anywhere on the
	starfield to exit.

	ES lets you specify how the stars move and rotate.  This is done
	from the command line or from the ARexx port.  For both, the
	argument syntax is the same.

   ARGUMENTS
	The M, R, and S operators specify star movement, rotation, and spin
	respectively.  Movement specifies how many world units the stars are
	translated each frame.  Rotation specifies a static/initial rotation
	angle.  Spin specifies the change in rotation for each frame.  The
	X, Y, and Z specifiers indicate which axes the operators are to
	apply.  Rotation angles are specified in "EuroHackerGrads."  There
	are 2048 EHG to a full 360 degree circle.

	The MRS operators must appear before the the XYZ specifiers, and
	there may be no spaces between them.  Only one MRS operator may
	appear before a given set of XYZ specifiers.  Following the MRSXYZ
	command are the actual values to be used.

	It's much easier to understand if you look at the examples.

	In addition to the above, there are two additional arguments that
	may be used:

	B:	Operate as background server.
		Ordinarily, ES will exit when you click on its screen.
		However, if you want to do extensive ARexx operations
		without user interference, this option may be specified,
		causing ES to ignore all subsequent mouse events on its
		screen.  Once backgrounded, ES cannot be un-backgrounded.
		The only way to terminate a backgrounded ES is with the
		following command:

	Q:	Quit.
		When sent as an ARexx command, ES will exit immediately.
		This option on the CLI command line is meaningless; if
		present, the entire command line is ignored.

   AREXX
	ES features an ARexx port.  The name of the port is EUROSTARS.
	Commands sent to this port are exactly the same as those on the
	command line.  Malformed commands are returned with RC set to
	RC_ERROR (10).

	Commands are cumulative; that is, a move command (for example)
	remains in effect until reset by another move command for the same
	axis.  Thus, an MX command followed later by an SX command does not
	cancel the MX command.

   EXAMPLES
	ES mx 4
		Move stars 4 units along X axis each frame.
	ES sxyz 2 -4 6
		For each frame, spin the X axis 2 EHG, the Y axis -4 EHG,
		and the Z axis 6 EHG.
	ES rx 512
		Rotate X axis 512 EHG and keep it there.
	ES rx -512 sx 2
		Start X axis rotated at -512 EHG and add 2 EHG to it each
		frame.
	ES mxz 10 0 sxyz 2 2 2
		Move 10 units along X, zero units along Z, and spin all axes
		by two EHG each frame.
	ES mxz sxyz 10 0 2 2 2
		Identical to the above.
	ES sxmxsymzsz 2 10 2 0 2
		Again, identical to the above.

	As you can see, the syntax is very flexible.

   NOTES
	Despite its nomenclature, the 'B' option does not fork ES into the
	background; you must use the 'Run' command.

	The coordinate system is right-handed, X axis horizontal, Y axis
	vertical, Z axis perpendicular to the screen.  Positive rotations
	are clockwise, and are in Z,Y,X order.

	The default startup values are:
	MX 0  MY 0  MZ 4   RX 0  RY 0  RZ 0   SX 0  SY 0  SZ 0

   BUGS
	Slow on a 68000.  Short of Disable()ing the system or reducing the
	number of stars, this is unavoidable.

	Malformed commands generate a diagnostic string to the CLI.  These
	strings are not available to ARexx programs.  Sigh...
