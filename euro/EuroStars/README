        Well, it's been a long while, but I finally got a Round Tuit.
Here's my latest display hack.

        ES (EuroStars) is a starfield program, with the added gimmick of
being able to move and spin at any rate on all three axes.  It is based on
some European code which I massively cleaned up and made system-friendly.
Then I mildly optimized some of the critical paths.  Then I added better
argument parsing.  Then I went mad and added an ARexx port.  It is written
in 100% assembly code (SAS assembler) and source is provided.

        I can't take all the credit for this one.  I'd like to express my
thanks to an unknown EuroHacker who wrote the original code on which this is
based (giving me knowledge that I much wanted), and to Greg Cunningham
(author of BaudBandit) for uploading it to Portal, from whence I downloaded,
disassembled, and studied it.

        I'd also like to express a note of thanks to all the good
EuroHackers everywhere, whose visually and technically stunning work have
always impressed me, and inspired me to follow in their footsteps in ways I
cannot express :-).

        I hope you like it.
