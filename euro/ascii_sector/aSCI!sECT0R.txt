 Hi dudes!                ø              rAPtØr oF sECtøR 5 is on key now...


 This  demo  is  our contribution to the Summer Party '96 held in Poznan.  It
 isn't  standard production, because it's an Ascii Demo, so it's all in ascii
 style...   Why  we  did  this demo?  The reason was very simple!  We want to
 became  the  best!   Well...  It isn't true of course!  heh..heh...  We feel
 that  the  polish  and world scene need more productions like "In a World Of
 Ascii" or "Ascii Mania" and we create Ascii Sector!

 Some  technical  things...   All  efects  was wrote using system comands and
 system  libraries...   Of course we need only standard libraries included in
 ROM and some libraries, that are lying on the disk.  Maybe some efects looks
 not very nice, but it isn't, so easy to wite demo, that is DOS FRIENDLY, but
 we want show you that Jay Miner create a good OS and it's good for all!  For
 games,  progz  and demos...  At the first you can see a black screen...  Why
 it  is  showed?   well...   Of course we must change the screen size for all
 effects,  that  are  in  this demo, so it is like a short moment of totality
 changeing screen size for all time...  We hope that you understand that.

 and  this is all things which we want to tell you, so see you in other ascii
 production...  maybe in near future or maybe later...

 What do you need to see this demo?
 A1200 or 14Mhz on board!
 Nothing more! No fast! No other CPU!

 So if you have fast or faster CPU then please turn off all this things,
 before you are start watching this!

                                                                 thanx!
