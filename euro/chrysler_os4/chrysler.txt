The video material is taken from Days of our Years (1955), a trilogy
of accidents and their effects on railroad workers and their families.

Compiled for AmigaOs 4 by Varthall/Up Rough (varti01@hotpop.com)

Changes:
- removed initial mixing frequency choice, 44100 Hz is now default
- removed fullscreen support, runs by default in windowed mode due
to a bug in the SDL library
- if the window can't be opened, it shows an error message and exit

Run it on a 32bit Workbench screen. On a 16bit one it uses shades
of white instead of yellow, funny :)
