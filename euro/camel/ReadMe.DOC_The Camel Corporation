 What, who? The CAMEL Corporation is an awesome duo consisting of ICronite
 and Milkshake (both ex-Anarchy DK). The reason for us to quit Anarchy and
 make our own little elite team, is that all the other creative danish (A)
 members left to found or join new groups - therefore we didn't see any
 advantage in being (A) members anymore!

 We have only got one problem in the Camel Corp. - it's called music!
 Neither ICronite nor I are able to compose music, we are therefore always
 interested in reciving modules from skilled musicians for inclusion in
 one of our future productions (soon to come - a small intro - working
 title "Dire Camels on MTV" - and we still haven't got any music for it!).

 As spreading is also a (minor) problem, we would like to get in touch
 with various SysOps. If you promise to spread our productions, you can
 get your BBS number in our future intros & demos for free! This time
 there is only one BBS advertised in the intro, and that is because it
 was spread exclusively on that board (greetings to you Trix/Anarchy for
 doing it!).


 Before I end I'd like to send a few messages to some of my ex-team
 members.

 Slammer & Xience / Melon Dezign: Let's hope that Seen (the pilot) can
 motivate you better than Anarchy did...

 Hannibal, Slash, Dan & Nuke / Lemon: Good luck with Lemon. Hope you
 can make something (wonderful) out of it...

 And of course I wish all those of you who are still in Anarchy, good
 luck in the future! Keep the flame alive!


 Anyway, if you want to contact Camel Corp. for any reasons (NOT swapping
 though), you should write to: Kent Stephan Jensen (Milkshake) 
                               Fuglebakkevej 112, 2th
                               8210 Aarhus V
                               Denmark

 You can also call both ICronite and I - our numbers can be found in the
 intro! :-)


 This intro has been successfully tested on the following hardware
 setups: A500 with 1/2 MB Chip + 1/2 MB Fake Fast running OS 1.3
         A500+ with 1 MB Chip running OS 2.0 (Yeah!)
         A2000 with 1 MB Chip + 2 MB Real Fast running OS 1.3
         A2000 with 1/2 MB Chip + 2 1/2 MB Real Fast running OS 1.3.

 PS: You can not run this intro from WorkBench, a strange bug occured,
     but ICronite really didn't bother to fix it, as he want to start
     coding something else.
