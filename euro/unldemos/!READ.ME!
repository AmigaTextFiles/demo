        UnreaL, an Amiga demo group, was found in the year of our Lord
1991 by a gfxman called Lighter (ex SpriteVision) and a coder called
SeNtiNeL (me!) and died somewhere in 1995 in the lack of further
inspiration and unknown destiny of Amiga movement.

        In meanwhile we made 14 different productions which all, except
our only megademo, are included in this archive. We planed more, but, as
most groups in these hard days, we didn't manage to finish it.

                                   * * *

        Here is the list of all UnreaL productions. All programs work on
stock Amiga 500 V1.3 with 512K CHIP memory and 512K FAST memory. Most of
them will work on other systems, but for some of them degrader of A500
emulation is needed. Also, after watching "Happy JoysDay!" you have to
reboot your system because it locks your trackdisk drives. Some of these
programs are PowerPacked or TitanCrunched, so if you mashine crashes
while depacking/decrunching you have to depack it manualy with unpacker.

                                   * * *

        Nowadays I even don't have any contact with the people who were
in UnreaL. Lighter (gfxman) went studying in Zagreb, Viper (musician) is
in the army, Zoom (swapper) is lost in school and Tolstoy (2nd coder) is
also missing. Only I, as coder and organizer, am still active on Amiga,
but not on Amiga demo scene anymore.                          """""""""
        """""""""""""""""""
        I don't even remember when I coded in assembler last time. I
have all my old routines, unfinished productions and included somewhere
in archive, but only God knows if I ever look for them. :-(
