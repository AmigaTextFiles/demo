To install Passengers on your harddrive do the following:

1. Create a directory called for example Passengers.
2. Copy Passengers and Passengers.info and all files
   ending with .Elk to this directory.

To start the demo execute Passengers.


BEWARE!  If you have an unexpanded A1200 strange things can happen due to
timing problems...  We didn't have time enough to track down these peculiar
bugs.
If enough people want a fix we will probably release one.
