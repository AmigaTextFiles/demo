@NODE Introduction "Introduction"

                             Introduction
                             ------------

I  needed  a  program like TrackSave for programming trackloaded games
and  demonstrations.  I  was very upset about the fact that I found no
satisfying  way  to  automatically  install  the current version of my
project  to  disk  by simply executing a batch file or ARexx script. I
had  to  enter a program called AsmOne in order to load all data areas
into  raw  memory, and then to write them to disk using the WT command
one  after the other. That was a very nasty procedure, especially when
changes of the disk segmentation became necessary. Another problem was
that  I  always  had  to  assemble  the disk on a physical floppy disk
drive.  It  would've been much more intelligent to fix it on a virtual
floppy (such as RAD or FMS by Matt Dillon/Jim Cooper) and then to copy
it  to  a  physical  disk  using a fully-featured disk copier (such as
SuperDuper by Sebastiano Vigna).

Using  TrackSave, I just need to execute a batch file or AREXX program
for  installing  all  data associated with my project to a physical or
virtual  disk.  As the name suggests, TrackSave writes tracks to disks
using the trackdisk.device. In addition to that, it can handle devices
similar  to  the  trackdisk.device, such as FMS or RAD. Don't expect a
sophisticated  GUI or something mystical like that, for TrackSave is a
simple  shell  tool. Last not least, TrackSave offers an exotic option
which  artificially  lengthens  disk  archives   and   an   option for
specifying an offset within your data file.

@NODE System_requirements "System requirements"

                         System requirements
                         -------------------

You need Kickstart 2.0 (V36) or higher to run TrackSave.

@NODE Shell_usage "Shell usage"

                             Shell usage
                             -----------

Template:        TrackSave   FILE/A,U=UNIT/N,S=START/N,L=LEN/N,
                             R=RANDOM/S,O=OFFSET/N,D=DEVICE
                             

FILE

File to tracksave.


UNIT (U)

Drive  unit  number,  e.g. 2 for DF2: or FF2:, depending on the device
you are using. Default is 0.
         

START (S)

Starting track number, default is 0.


LEN (L)

Number of tracks to write. If you omit the LEN argument, the number of
tracks  depends  on the file length. Keep in mind that START + LEN may
not exceed 80 tracks if LEN is specified.


RANDOM (R)

If  the  RANDOM option is set and the file length does not fit exactly
into  a multiple of tracks (11264 bytes), the surplus memory is filled
up with random data instead of zeros. Keep in mind that disk archivers
usually  can't gain a single byte out of random data. You can use this
option  in order to lengthen disk archives which are the usual way for
spreading  trackloaded  disks  in  bulletin  board systems ;-) Default
setting is off.


OFFSET (O)

This  numeric argument enables you to define a byte offset within your
data  file,  thus  allowing you to skip a given number of bytes before
writing. Default is 0.


DEVICE (D)

This  argument  allows  you  to  specify   a   device   different from
trackdisk.device.  It should be trackdisk-like, such as fmsdisk.device
for floppy partitions or ramdrive.device for RAD. It is not adviced to
use  devices  like  audio.device or stuff like that anyway. Default is
trackdisk.device.

@NODE Examples "Examples"

                               Examples
                               --------

TrackSave dh0:data.raw         

tracksaves the file dh0:data.raw to DF0:, starting with track 0.


TrackSave dh0:data.raw UNIT 2 LEN 50

tracksaves  the  file  dh0:data.raw  to  DF2:,  starting with track 0,
length  is  50  tracks.  If  data.raw  is  smaller than 50 tracks, the
surplus  memory  is  filled  with  zeros  before   writing. Otherwise,
data.raw is cut at byte offset 563200 (50*11264).


TrackSave dh0:data.raw S=10 R D=ramdrive.device

tracksaves  the  file dh0:data.raw to RAD:, starting with track 10. If
data.raw  does  not fit exactly in a multiple of tracks (11264 bytes),
surplus memory is filled with random data.


TrackSave dh0:data.raw 2 d fmsdisk.device o 10000 l 40 s 10 r

tracksaves  the  file  dh0:data.raw  starting  with  offset   10000 to
fmsdisk-device  FF2:.  Length  is  40  tracks,  start  is track 10. If
data.raw minus 10000 does not fit exactly in 450560 bytes (40 tracks),
surplus  memory is filled with random data. If data.raw minus 10000 is
greater than 40 tracks, it is cut at (its total) offset 460560.
