                   THE 'ALL TIME GREATEST HITS' LOOK BACK...

SINCE THESE PACKS ARE OBVIOUSLY GETTING MORE AND MORE KNOWN, THANX TO ALL
THE NICE GUYS WHO SPREAD 'EM, I FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO MAKE THIS SORT OF
OVERVIEW! THIS MAKES IT EASIER FOR ALL OF YOU WHO WANTS TO SEND ME 
MODULES, BECAUSE NOW YOU CAN SEE WHAT STUFF I'VE ALREADY USED IN OLDER ISSUES!

INTERESTED IN GETTING OLDER 'ATGH' PACKS, THEN YOU CAN MAIL ME 2 CHECKED DISKS

			     DENMARK (COOL!)


HMMM... I GUESS THATS ALL, SO LETS ROLL THE LIST!

NOTE: THE AUTHORS GROUPNAMES ARE WRITTEN AFTER WHICH GROUP THEY WERE IN
WHEN THE PACK WAS RELEASED, SO I DON'T HAVE TO UPDATE THIS LIST ALL THE TIME!
EXAMPLE: IN VOL. 3 AND 4, BJøRN LYNNE IS CREDITED AS DR. AWESOME/CRUSADERS.
WHILE IN THE FIFTH VOLUME, WHEN HE'D LEFT CRS, HE IS CREDITED BY HIS REAL
NAME!!! PRETTY EASY TO UNDERSTAND, I THINK...
