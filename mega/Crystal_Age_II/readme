About Crystal Age 
-----------------

This demo from 1990 features music from Frankie Goes To Hollywood

and should work on any 68000-PAL-Amiga. As the disk drive is 

pushed to its limit (tracks 0-82 used, sample-load in realtime),

some drives may cause static noise. 


Installing
----------

I.	Start executable file 'Crystal_1' and insert blank disk
	in drive 0.

II.	Start executable file 'Crystal_2' and re-insert disk
	in drive 0.

III.	Start executable file 'Crystal_3' and re-insert disk
	in drive 0.

IV.	Reset your Amiga with Crystal Age in drive 0

	[no WB intro/exit -- sorry, but these were the '80s :-) ]
