This are the MS-DOS and BeOS sources of Megademo IV. 
Dont expect too much. The whole demo was written from 
scratch in just a few days. 

You can use this source as a base for ports to other
platforms. 

The following sources have to be implemented on your system:

g_null.c	Graphics output
i_null.c	Keyboard input 
l_null.c	timer (l_null.c is using the standard ansi-c 
		timer, which is too inaccurate)
s_null.c	sound (has to play an 8 bit signed sample at 11025khz)

sys_null.c 	might have to be adapted for your system, but it should compile	
		out-of-the-box.
	
The other sources should not be touched. Please renamed the sources to
x_<your system>.c when you implement system specific functions.

In case your ported the demo to a new platform, plase mail the exe to
one of the authors. Mailing your sourcecode additions wouldnt be that
bad, too.

Otherwhise feel free to do with the source whatever you want. If you 
want to release something based on it, notification of the authors 
would be nice.
