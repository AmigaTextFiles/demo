         a portable multimedia demonstration

        an audiovisual experiment by Artwork


This is a quite unusual "scene" demo. It is  unusual
in  several  aspects.  It  has a very uncommon style
using lots of multilayered  effects,  nearly  no  3d
scenes  and  a  it  has  only  a  "sound-background"
instead  of  the  usual,  mostly  techno-style  demo
musics.

The other very unusual aspect is that this  demo  is
100%  system  independent,  it is portable. This was
achieved by programming the demo in 100% ANSI C  and
using  no hardware or OS-specific functions (special
interrupts etc.)

Following  ports  currently are  finished  or  under
progress: Amiga68k, MS-DOS, WIN95/NT (directx), BeOS
x86, BeOS PPC, Linux x86 & Amiga PPC. Further  ports
will be announced soon on the webpage.

The amiga68k port of this demo was firstly shown  to
the public on the "Mekka-Symposium 98".

The demos message is quite simple: The group Artwork
does not exist anymore.
